</div><h1>Chapter 915</h1><p>Side Drulay, the west gate</p>
<p>What a pathetic display!</p>
<p>Dogsinger growled as she pierced through several antidemons to camouflage. The power of the arrow shot from the dragonkin’s mana deserved a blow with a killing intent.</p>
<p>Even if I recognized him as my friend now, I would shudder every time he walked beside me.</p>
<p>Some of my subordinates were really scared. At first, I asked Miranleil if there were any arrows that didn’t make a sound, but she replied with a good smile.</p>
<p>Apparently that arrow has a lot of effect. Miranleil told me that “My arrow is just like a dragon’s roar! The enemies I hear are scared, and my friend is inspired!” I think that dragon’s roar could scare my friend too, right?</p>
<p>Well, it was something we didn’t know. Every time that sounded, the enemy would die, and that enemy would be intimidated. Soon, every time a similar sounded, they might be in panic.</p>
<p>At the same time, morale for our allies would increase. However, the antidemons will be halved in effect. After all, they don’t have the emotions to be frightened by them.</p>
<p>Even our allies had been hostile to each other up until now. Many of them were worried about when that arrow would hit them from the back.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there was no doubt that she was the best fighter she could be.</p>
<p>After all, the antidemons this time were several times larger than usual. It would be a problem if they were to do something bad and lose their motivation.</p>
<p>That was the type of guy who would turn his belly button when he denied his insistence. I’m sure he was. If that was the case, I wouldn’t let him do whatever he wants, but...</p>
<p>「It can’t be helped. I’m coming forward too. I’ll leave the commander to you.」</p>
<p>「Y-yes! Be careful, big sis!」</p>
<p>I’m still in the third seat of the Bloodfang Brigade. I’m very confident in our melee combat. I’m good enough to fight so flashy in the front and raise the morale of my men.</p>
<p>「Short Jump!」</p>
<p>I used short-range teleport to leap into the middle of an enemy’s attack. To be honest, a teleport skill of my caliber would be of little use in a real battle. Both chanting and gathering were very long.</p>
<p>But just because he had a few rare wielders of this kind raised the spirits of his allies.</p>
<p>「Uwooooh! Follow Drulay’s big brother!」</p>
<p>The momentum of my underlings led the other groups to rush in. I had a lot of antidemons, so if I didn’t have that much momentum, I wouldn’t be able to get through it.</p>
<p>But Fran and I were blown away by something.</p>
<p>Dogsinger’s arrow flew away again. Come on, it was right next to me, right? You’re not aiming for it, right?</p>
<p>「I have an urgent message!」</p>
<p>「Got it!」</p>
<p>「Tell her to Dogsinger. Just shoot her harder!」</p>
<p>I’ll just beat them up like this!</p>
<p>Side: Gephe, South Gate</p>
<p>「Don’t aim your intimidation at me, fucking puppy!」</p>
<p>「That’s my line! Lizard bastard!」</p>
<p>「Ah?」</p>
<p>「Ahhh?」</p>
<p>I can’t let them get into the same playing field as they did back then! They always lunged at me!</p>
<p>I guess I have to tell them that I’m better than them here!</p>
<p>「Oi iii! Dogs! The battle is over!」</p>
<p>「What do you mean?」</p>
<p>「Who will beat up more antidemons in this battle! The battle is over with points!」</p>
<p>「Very well! Don’t overdo it!」</p>
<p>「I thought you were strong, but not to that extent!」</p>
<p>「That’s my line! Damn!」</p>
<p>We showed off each other’s antidemon cards and spread out. After all, we’d get points awarded to the other party if we were nearby.</p>
<p>We can’t afford to lose to the old dog! We’re at full throttle from the start! There were a lot of antidemons this time, and I’m not going to be free against those who would kill us!</p>
<p>「Shah! Evil Miracles!」</p>
<p>What I used was a ranged attack that made use of evil energy. This was a technique that only a half-evil dragonkin would have a wielder of. Even if there was any, they would be treated as evil on outside the continent.</p>
<p>The evil energy disturbs the antidemons’ magic and reduces their defenses. The shockwave that they released together struck them and crushed their bodies.</p>
<p>These antidemons, with their ecology similar to magic beasts, were nothing short of delicious to me. I’ll just beat them up and win!</p>
<p>「Uwooooh!」</p>
<p>Tsk! I was in a good mood as I beat up all the antidemons. I even used Wangon’s beast smell Awakening before. I seriously shouldn’t underestimate those dog-types that have become like that.</p>
<p>That’s because his roar has the same property of disrupting magic power as my evil energy.</p>
<p>「You can’t be serious! You can’t be disciplined, just a stray dog!」</p>
<p>「You fucking shit out of that black thing! Let’s do this antidemon whole thing!」</p>
<p>「Haaa!?」</p>
<p>「Haaa!?」</p>
<p>「......Sigh. I guess you guys never get tired of it once in a while.」</p>
<p>As I was training and doing shitty dog training, my subordinates felt something moving in their mouths.</p>
<p>「Did you say something?」</p>
<p>「N-Nothing.」</p>
<p>「Hahaha! It seems you’ve finally reached your ears!」</p>
<p>「Shut up! Don’t sniff it out! You’re a stray dog after all!」</p>
<p>「Get back! Black lizards!」</p>
<p>「Yeah?」</p>
<p>「Haaa!?」</p>
<p>「...You guys are really close, aren’t you?」</p>
<p>Did you say something again?</p>
<p>Side North Gate: Gazzol</p>
<p>「Bryne, I’m coming forward. Can you help me?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, just leave it to me! I’m sure it’ll be easy on this battlefield.」</p>
<p>「What are you saying? Soon, it’ll be a hell of a busy place.」</p>
<p>「I know! That’s just a joke, a joke!」</p>
<p>The man who waved his hand and smirked was Bryne, first seat of the Bloodfang Brigade. He was a belligerent and crude man, but he was so pitiful that few people would be able to rely on him on the battlefield like this.</p>
<p>She was one of the people who had killed each other before, but she was not the one who was dragged by a cause or condition and made a wrong decision. I was relieved and my back was left to her.</p>
<p>This man was strong as a warrior, but his true commander was in the middle guard. He used wind magic to long-range attacks and the unique skill “Cursing” to weaken his enemies.</p>
<p>What was more, I was even able to inspire my comrades and raise their levels with multiple command skills. I may be better at simple combat, but Bryne was by far the more perfect combat commander.</p>
<p>「Windscales! Let’s go with that one!」</p>
<p>「Yes! You can do it at any time!」</p>
<p>「Haaa! Blow them up!」</p>
<p>Bryne unleashed a wind spell at me, but it wasn’t a false shot. My windshield could incorporate wind magic and increase its thickness.</p>
<p>Knowing this, Bryne unleashed an attack spell on me. I had the opportunity to work together in a battle to defend against antidemons before, so I did the same.</p>
<p>「Tch! It’s as hard as ever! My wind has completely swallowed me!」</p>
<p>「Fuhahaha! It takes a lot of skill to break my wind wall with wind magic!」</p>
<p>「Eventually, I’ll blow them away!」</p>
<p>Despite saying that, Bryne had already begun to eliminate the antidemons around me. He was still complaining, but his job was fast.</p>
<p>You mean to put someone like him in your side, right? That’s strange because I think the vicious side of him is cute too.</p>
<p>「What the hell? You’re not grinning on the battlefield after all」</p>
<p>「Oops, sorry.」</p>
<p>「You’d better do it seriously!」</p>
<p>「Hahaha! I know!」</p>
<p>As they exchanged such an exchange, a tremendous roar echoed about. According to the report from the subordinates at the top of the wall, the city wall on the eastern side of the wall had been destroyed.</p>
<p>「Muh. What should we do? Bryne! Do you think we should send out a little reinforcement from here?」</p>
<p>「No way! We’ve got a lot of hands! Besides, I’m not too worried that you might be right there!」</p>
<p>Bryne was right, we didn’t have time to defend ourselves here. This antidemon season was on a different scale than usual.</p>
<p>They had only been attacked once a few times by about forty or fifty thousand antidemons. I didn’t say that they could be easily defended, but Sendia’s forces were sure enough to repel them.</p>
<p>But this year, nearly fifty thousand antidemons were at each gate. On the contrary, it seemed that even more antidemons were gathered at the east gate.</p>
<p>「Windscales! Let’s focus on defending this place first!」</p>
<p>「Indeed! How should we do it!?」</p>
<p>All we can do is attract the antidemons and protect the gate! That would be our support for the saintess and the Black Lightning Princess!</p>
<p>「I may die, but I will protect this place!」</p>
<p>「Haha! You’re right!」</p>
<p>Side - Ashwrath</p>
<p>「Well, I’ll be the one to do this then」</p>
<p>Just a little west of the illegal city of Sendia, this plain was filled with over 100,000 antidemons marching east.</p>
<p>At first, we had been chasing after the dragonkin, who started acting suspiciously to lure the antidemons. We had caught a few of them, but it was already too late to realize their plots.</p>
<p>They had used themselves as decoys to gather antidemons and invite them to Sendia. They had skipped orders from the Dragon King, but they had no time to question him for details.</p>
<p>We already knew that the other hordes were headed for Sendia. Oh, that’s what the holy knights told us.</p>
<p>I never thought I’d run into those trash in a place like this. They chirped me a lot of things before I got the dirt in.</p>
<p>Silard has been sending an assailant to take away my Divine Sword. I’ve fought him many times for retaliation. To put it bluntly, he’s hostile.</p>
<p>The ones who were called holy knights in particular were occupied by bombons from the nobility and were really famous for their poor quality.</p>
<p>That’s why the Divine Sword Knight had a hard time using it. Well, they didn’t have any sympathy for him though, because they didn’t like him that much.</p>
<p>She wasn’t a bad person, but she left too much of her reason for action with the country. It was just too much for her.</p>
<p>「Oh right, we have to deal with the antidemons first.」</p>
<p>If they joined up, we wouldn’t be able to withstand it no matter how great that town was.</p>
<p>「There are a lot of people in that town who don’t want to die. So, I’m going without any hesitation, okay?」</p>
<p>Let’s go on a rampage!</p>
