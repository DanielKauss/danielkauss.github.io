</div><h1>Chapter 1091</h1><p>Fran and the others, who had refused the invasion from the Kingdom of Shallus, had returned to Barbra for now. They were now waiting for Shallus Kingdom’s reaction by sending emissaries to them. The summons they collected were already shattered into pieces, but they were under Gamud’s control. They must leave them to the government for the time being. Meanwhile, Fran was helping with the reconstruction of Barbra. Fran was concerned about Alessa, but she couldn’t leave Barbra alone. There was also information that Alessa’s defense was going well. It seemed that they had gathered former Rank A adventurers and pushed them back quite a bit. It seemed that they had gathered former Rank A adventurers and pushed back quite a bit.  Fran, who didn’t have to go to Alessa by force, was now cooking and cleaning up the rubble in Barbra. The other thing they needed to do was to eliminate the people between the Raidos Kingdom.  Perhaps because they wanted to get too much information, Diaz’s men had infiltrated Barbra several times.  Well, it would be difficult to deceive Fran and Urushi’s eyes if they were wary of their arrival.  Moreover, Felmus and Diaz were now there. The only ones who played an active role in this were the “Owl’s Eye” and “Awareness” skills that they had obtained from the magic stone soldiers.  The owl’s eyes were a skill that could be seen clearly even at night. It seemed to be better for her active eyesight than night vision.  As the name suggested, the skill made it easier for her to distinguish between the sounds of the surrounding area.  It was very useful for searching between people.  Or rather, she had defeated so many people, but she only had three new skills. Well, it couldn’t be helped though, since most of the magic stone soldiers were just using martial arts, martial arts, and magic skills.  Most of them were skills they already had.  The other one was a skill called “Metal Flexible”.  It seemed to have a lot of uses for this as well. Now it’s come in handy in repairing distorted metal door. Thanks to Fran and Urushi’s efforts, Barbra had managed to calm down recently.  He returned to watching rockers a few times, but they had not suffered any major invasions either. I guess they haven’t been able to attack us easily once the navy was destroyed.  We didn’t have to move around from morning till night, so we were trying to do something.  </p>
<p>『Okay, I’ll give it a try.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>  Fran’s room was given to us by the guild. Under the lanterns hanging from the ceiling, Fran was seriously looking at the multiple small bags placed on the table.  These were the item bags she had acquired in various places in the past. Some were taken from goblins, others from the hideouts of slavers. I’ve heard that if I used cursing magic, I could force them to open, so I was going to take a look inside today.  First, I’ll try the one with the lowest magic power.  I wonder how this one got it. To be honest, I can’t tell which one it was by just looking at it.  </p>
<p>『Hoo!  Nuuh...』</p>
<p>「Master, are you okay?」</p>
<p>『Yeah.  It has a lot less resistance than unsheathing the slave’s collar. Just a little longer...』</p>
<p>  I couldn’t tell what would happen if I poured in magic power all at once.  I cautiously, slowly increased my magic power. Then I could see that the item bag shone a light and transformed its magic power.  </p>
<p>『Will it open with this?』</p>
<p>「How is it?」</p>
<p>『Oooh!  It’s open!』</p>
<p>「What’s in it?」</p>
<p>  Fran looked excited as well.  It was like a treasure chest. However, her expression soon changed into a subtle one.  </p>
<p>『It’s out of place』</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>  There was only an iron knife and a little money in it. They also had some mobile food.  So, they were probably just like emergency bags in case of an emergency.  The next thing that came out of the bag was a large number of weapons.  It was not a very high-quality one, but it could be used normally. Was it a substitute for a bandit’s weapons storage?  </p>
<p>『This one was also out of place, huh?』</p>
<p>「... Nn.」</p>
<p>  She opened it up, but nothing came out of it. The most valuable thing was an ordinary silver ring that had no magical value.  Even if I sold everything that came out, it would not be enough to reach 300 thousand Goldes. It’s not cheap, but it’s far from the treasure Fran wanted.  </p>
<p>『This is the end』</p>
<p>「... Nn」</p>
<p>  Fran’s nodded her head!  But I think we can expect a little from this. After all, the magic power contained in it was quite strong.  The dismantling curse was not going to be that simple.  </p>
<p>『Haaaa!』</p>
<p>  I greatly kneaded my magic and broke the restrictions on my item bags.  There was a lot of resistance. Perhaps it was as strong as the slave collars of Princess Selimia and her friends.  If it were a human body, it would not be surprising if blood was gushing out of their bodies. Well, it wouldn’t be a problem for me though!  </p>
<p>『Alright!  I’m opening it!』</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>  Fran opened the item bag and pulled out the contents, looking a little hopeful. Then she tilted her head at what had appeared.  There were several documents in it.  </p>
<p>「This is...!  A slave contract!」</p>
<p>『Moreover, this is our list of customers!』</p>
<p>  It contained a lot of information, such as where they brought the slaves and where to sell them. I could feel the faint magic power of the curse, so it seemed that some kind of magic was being applied to it.  The contract didn’t even say minimum rights.  It was clearly a contract for illegal slaves. However, there were no signs of them being used. I bet they had prepared themselves in advance to create that illegal slave.  </p>
<p>『Our list......  I’ve got a lot of noble-looking names, but which country is it? Could it be Kranzel?』</p>
<p>「Master, come here.」</p>
<p>『Ashtner’s name is on it!』</p>
<p> But that’s not all.  It also had the names of Ashtner’s nobles, like Alessand and Ormez.  Like I thought, the nobles in the Kranzel Kingdom were also among their clients. It was possible that they were not only buying illegal slaves, but they were connected to the Raidos Kingdom behind the scenes.  Marquis Ashtner and her men may have already been crushed, but there might be other traitors left behind. This list can be used to uncover such spies. </p>
<p>『We can’t leave them in a strange place.』</p>
<p>「Where’s the Gwads?」</p>
<p>『Well, I guess that’s the best way.』</p>
<p> Aside from Eiworth, the other three will probably have their respective histories.Marquis Ashtner and her men would have already been crushed, but there might be other traitors left behind. This list could be used to uncover such spies from Raydoss. </p>
<p>『We can’t leave them in a strange place.』</p>
<p>「Where’s the Gwads?」</p>
<p>『Well, I guess that’s the best way.』</p>
<p>Aside from Eiworth, the other three will probably have their respective histories. We should talk to them first.</p>
