</div><h1>Chapter 1019</h1><p>On the legs of the giant antidemons, everyone else attacked, but they couldn’t destroy all three of them. Their legs were much larger than the miscellaneous buildings on Earth. Moreover, they were still covered with powerful barriers. Still, they all gathered their strength and disappeared with two legs. Fran and Urushi swung their magic power down, Hilt and Colbert spit out blood and engulfed their dragonkin. Chelsea and the other dragonkin used Dragon Form to its limit, while the others continued to unleash their magic and martial arts. Chelsea and the other dragonkin used Dragon Form to its limit, and the others continued to unleash their magic and martial arts.  Then, they succeeded in pushing the third one to half-destroy. Can they just push it forward like this? But just as the slightest hope began to light up in everyone’s minds, despair soon arrived.  Everyone fell into a shortage of magic power, and their attacks loosened.  The gap was fatal. In no time at all, their regeneration speed exceeded, and the body of the giant antidemon was restored.  It wasn’t just us that we were in a hurry. Even when using only our legs, our magic absorption power was still alive, and we ran out of magic power earlier than we had expected.  As a result, the giant antidemons were beginning to regain their appearance. About half of their torso had already been regenerated.  It was frustrating, but we couldn’t win now that we didn’t have Addle.  On the contrary, more than half of them were incapable of fighting and in danger of being annihilated.  Fortunately, the huge antidemons that were still regenerating could not afford to attack us. We should have escaped now.  It would be difficult to even hold them back here anymore. There would be no way for us to fight unless we survive and merge the forces of the continent.  If we plan to keep fighting here, we will certainly need someone on Addle’s level. However, Addler is unconscious and is wandering around the border of life and death.  The rest is Isario or Ashwrath, but we don’t know where either of them is. No, Isario might be buried under the castle, but it would be quite difficult to dig through and find the giant antidemons.  Even so, there was a small chance. We would have to either run away or head for the castle with the possibility of Isario survival.  In the latter case, we would have to split up into a search group and a decoy group that would attract huge antidemons.  The decoy group was also likely to be annihilated. This could be called a “destroyer group”.  And Orfalve, who was now their substantial commander, seemed to have decided to retreat.  No one disobeyed her words. Fran and the others probably wanted to rescue Isario, but they also knew that they could not sacrifice the vast majority of people in the area to do so.  Those who could not move were picked up by the ones who could move and began to move.  However, the regeneration speed of the giant antidemons seemed to have exceeded our expectations. Maybe it was because of the supply of magic power from the Abyss Eater, they seemed to be faster than in the beginning.  Before they had enough distance, the giant antidemons had started to move.  There were only five legs yet, but that seemed to be enough for them to move. They approached us at an unrealistic speed, moving wildly in their newly regenerated legs.  </p>
<p>「Snorabit’s warriors!  Get to the front!」</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Yeah!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>「I guess we have no choice but to deal with them too.  Those who can’t move won’t have time to escape, okay?」</p>
<p>「We’ll do the same, Colbert. The others, get down with the adventurers.」</p>
<p>「Understood, young miss.」</p>
<p>  The dwarves’ calmness even exceeded my imagination. They were lined up neatly in the face of the approaching giant antidemons.  Fran held me up and looked motivated. But just before the giant antidemons reached us, Fran had found something.  </p>
<p>(Master. There’s something there.)</p>
<p>『What?』</p>
<p>  When I followed Fran’s gaze, I found that there was indeed something flying in the sky. Even from here, I could tell that it was reasonably large.  Immediately after we noticed it, the mysterious flying object began to dive down at once.  It approached us with a jerk toward the back of the giant antidemon. It was finally a bright red dragon.  It was the familiar dragon.  </p>
<p>「Rindo!」</p>
<p>『Yeah!』</p>
<p>  It was the red dragon Lind, the incarnation of the violent dragon sword, Lindwilm. In other words, there were――  multiple shadows leapt from the Lind.  </p>
<p>「Mea! Quina is here too!」</p>
<p>『And moreover, Zefmate and Sophie are here too!』</p>
<p> As they fell, they each unleashed their own attacks.  Mea’s white flames and Lind’s breath.  Quina and Zefmate crushed their legs as they passed each other. Perhaps strengthened by Sophie’s magical songs, each of them had a surprising power.  </p>
<p>「Fuhahahaha!  I-I ascend!」</p>
<p>「I’ll meet up with Fran and the others if I have time to waste.」</p>
<p>「U-Understood!」</p>
<p> The usual Mea and Quina followed by Zefmate and Sophie.  </p>
<p>「Fran!  So you’re safe!」</p>
<p>「Nn!  But why are you here?」</p>
<p>「Because of that terrible wall!」</p>
<p>  Apparently, the thin-purple barrier that had appeared with the giant antidemons had covered a much wider area than we had expected. Even Nocta had been captured inside. </p>
<p>「I thought there was a cause for that huge antidemon, so I came to scout it out......」</p>
<p>「Looks like we arrived at a good place!」</p>
<p>「Nn. Thank you.」</p>
<p>「We’ll hold him back! Fran, help me!」</p>
<p>「Okay!」</p>
<p> With this, the huge antidemon scout battle began, with Mea, Quina, Zefmate, Fran, Urushi, and Hilt all moving at high speed.  Orfalve and Jayne were leaving the scene again with their troops. It was easier for them to escape than most of the others.  Sophie’s magical songs on Lind increased the offensive power of all of them. Because of this, they were able to focus on destroying the legs of the giant antidemons while continuously impeding their movements.  </p>
<p>(Sophie, I wonder if you can play the adventurer’s song?)</p>
<p>『Isn’t that gonna take place without the help of the townspeople? If they can use a single song, then the oratorio is gonna be too strong』</p>
<p>(I see......)</p>
<p>  Fran probably just wanted to hear the adventurer’s song.  It’s a little disappointing though. Well, it’s also motivating and I don’t hate her though.  </p>
<p>『Anyways, we’re gonna buy Orfalve and Jayne time to escape!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  While teaming up with Mea and Zefmate, we will continue to stall the giant antidemons. Although she has many legs, it still depends on the legs she was aiming for.  We continued to attack the three on the right side intensively, always aiming for a state where it was difficult to balance. Fran, Mea, and Hilt were at the center of it all, so far we should be doing fine.  However, it only took a few minutes in time. She was always on the receiving end of each blow, and her attention to evasion only made her feel like she was fighting for tens of minutes.  However, in a little while, she would be freed from this last battle. According to Jayne’s report, she would be able to use her stealth granting to all troops in a few minutes.  As long as they could escape from the other troops, our work would be over.  We could take advantage of the speed difference and escape at once. No matter how strong the giant antidemons are, they don’t lose in speed.  However, there was no way this powerful enemy would end like this. The battle seemed to be going smoothly, but something strange happened.  The giant antidemons suddenly stopped moving. They stopped and began to twitch on the spot, the same as when they were transformed into seven legs.  The giant antidemons began to change their appearance again, making an deafening sound.  The seven legs and heads of the antidemons sank into the air. Then, as the inside of their torso wriggled in small steps, it began to swell. Their rather slender form, similar to that of a spider, transformed into a circular form, focusing on roundness.  Several dozen seconds later, there was a sphere. It was a very clean sphere. It looked like a soccer ball due to the armored joint.  It looked thin in the center――well, it was thinner than that huge antidemon, but in fact, it was a 10-meter-wide ditch that circled its body.  The spheres that were lined up in the ditch were visible, but...  Anyway, it was simple, but it looked strangely intimidating. </p>
<p>「Buuuoooooogh!」</p>
<p>『Hah!</p>
<p>『Sigh!</p>
<p>『Sigh! I-Is it because she’s rolling around?』</p>
