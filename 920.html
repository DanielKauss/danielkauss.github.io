</div><h1>Chapter 920</h1><p>「Divine Beast Form!」</p>
<p>With those words, a divine power was born. At the same time, the power was converted into black lightning, wrapped around Fran and enveloped her.</p>
<p>The black lightning that enveloped the area around Fran looked like a black lotus bud. Inside the black bud, which emitted a dull sound, power swelled with terrifying force.</p>
<p>A few moments later, when the black lightning burst and disappeared, Fran, who had gained new powers, stood there.</p>
<p>Divine Beast Form. This seems to be the true nature of the power――or skill, that Fran used. In terms of words, this skill is probably similar to the Divine Dragon Form of a dragonkin.</p>
<p>However, there was no significant change compared to Velmeria’s Divine Dragon Form.</p>
<p>It was probably just her hair, claws, and fangs that had grown a little longer. She didn’t seem to have any fur on her body. It was plain for a scene like a magic girl’s makeover.</p>
<p>However, the only thing that was plain was her appearance. Anyone who could feel the vicious power swirling within her would be angry at her.</p>
<p>That’s not something flashy or anything like that.</p>
<p>The aura it radiated was overwhelmingly different. The aura it radiated was that of a transcendental sword, and the strength of the black lightning it wore was also on a different level.</p>
<p>Black lightning, like a dragon, several times larger than before, swirled and bounced around Fran. It was as if a black lightning incarnation had taken shape and was standing there.</p>
<p>Her stats are also exceptional. A Divine Beast has been added to her race, becoming a Divine Beast in her current state. Her strength and vitality have exceeded 1000, and her agility and mana have exceeded 2000.</p>
<p>That’s him in his original state. His abilities would be further enhanced if he was strengthened by his skills.</p>
<p>「Hmm?」</p>
<p>Fran turned her palms to the antidemons to check something out.</p>
<p>「Hmm」</p>
<p>『Whoa!』</p>
<p>The moment Fran put up some light pressure, an extremely thick black lightning bolted out from her palm. It was probably about the thickness of a teleport pole.</p>
<p>The black lightning burned the air and antidemons, pushing forward about 20 meters, bursting and dissipating. At its remains was a safe zone, created by the disappearance of a large number of antidemons.</p>
<p>「Yeah, amazing」</p>
<p>『Y-yeah. This is bad.』</p>
<p>From Fran’s point of view, it was probably just a light feeling of determination. However, I could tell that was enough to activate a tremendous amount of magic power.</p>
<p>Fran herself stared into her palm and was surprised. But soon she had a serious expression on her face. Fran then held her palm out again.</p>
<p>This time, I could see that he was focused.</p>
<p>「Yes!」</p>
<p>With a short exhalation, my magic power wriggled even more than before, and black lightning was released.</p>
<p>The black lightning, which was thick enough for a human to swallow, was raging around in the antidemon horde like a snake scurrying around.</p>
<p>『Oooh! That was awesome...』</p>
<p>「Hehe.」</p>
<p>With just one shot, more than a hundred high-ranking antidemons should have been eradicated. This was about the same power as our secret move, the Black Lightning Advent.</p>
<p>However, unlike the Black Lightning Advent, which releases awakening when used, this one was able to unleash a series of attacks.</p>
<p>Fran responded to my surprise with a somewhat look on her face. But the true value of the current Fran was not just black lightning.</p>
<p>Next, Fran broke her knees lightly and braced herself. Next to the mana, she was going to test her physical strength.</p>
<p>「Fuuh!」</p>
<p>Just by flying forward, the surrounding scenery flowed at an incredible speed. The black and red lines were probably the color of antidemons.</p>
<p>I hurriedly used my space-time magic. I had accelerated my time even faster than before, and finally recognized the scenery.</p>
<p>She had used self-acceleration before. But Fran had become so fast that even I could not keep up with it.</p>
<p>「Oops!」</p>
<p>『I-it’s okay, Fran!』</p>
<p>「Don’t worry」</p>
<p>Fran had accelerated so much that even she herself had no control over it. She probably just wanted to move a little, but she had traveled nearly 50 meters and flicked away the antidemons in between with her body.</p>
<p>Fran was not injured. This was probably because the magic power cloaking her was as thick as a barrier.</p>
<p>Fran nodded many times as she was making her hands gooey after defeating the antidemons with her blunt blow. Apparently, she recognized her power exactly.</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>『I’ve become much stronger!』</p>
<p>「I can protect everyone with this!」</p>
<p>Aah, now that she mentioned it... she was about to hit the hammer, but I still couldn’t hear her voice.</p>
<p>But instead, I heard Announcer-san’s voice.</p>
<p>《The individual named Master’s name can now be changed temporarily》</p>
<p>Eh? What did Announcer-san mean?</p>
<p>《King Wolf Sword, Fenrir――None of the naming conditions have been met. The naming will be discarded》</p>
<p>W-What’s going on?</p>
<p>The name of the royal wolf sword, Fenrir, is just like a divine sword!</p>
<p>Hey, can I explain it to someone!?</p>
