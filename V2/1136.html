</div><h1>Chapter 1136</h1><p>「Donad! Are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Indeed......」</p>
<p> I hurriedly used my recovery magic on Donadrond, who had collapsed right after defeating Chardman. It seems that the recoil was immense. Even though his wounds were healed, he could not get up immediately. </p>
<p>「That was the last amazing technique!」</p>
<p>「It was a technique that returned the damage I had taken so far to my opponent. If I killed him even more, I felt that I could use it with my senses」</p>
<p> He seemed to have used the technique he had learned from mutation in his real combat. Moreover, he had to take more than a certain amount of damage to make it work. He must be so daring to try it on the verge of death! It must be so daring to try and take it down to death!  </p>
<p>「I have a lot of questions I want to ask you, but...  I’m going to help the nobles right now」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  She was probably wondering about how Fran and Urushi appeared here, what that ghoul was, and many other things.  But she was in the middle of a fight right now. They decided to postpone it.  Once again, they began to exterminate the undead around them.  </p>
<p>「Doraaaaah!」</p>
<p>  Donadrond’s axe easily cut the undead of his enemy in half. He was a reasonably strong opponent among the enemy’s undead.  At the very least, it would have been a struggle for Donadrond in the past.  However, despite his heavy exhaustion, it was a piece of cake now. His slashes were surprisingly bold and sharp.  </p>
<p>「Donad, amazing!」</p>
<p>「Fuhahahaha!  It’s filled with power! I’m a little tired, but my muscles are rather strong!」</p>
<p>「Oooh!」</p>
<p>  Donadrond said, </p>
<p>「Hmph!」</p>
<p>  and showed his creation of a forceful sigh. His biceps that swelled up looked like a log.  Originally, he was a muscular demon, but now he was even more pumped up and looked two larger. Fran was staring at Donadrond, who was posing with sparkling eyes.  And she also started to pose for him herself.  He was a by-seep, just like Donadrond. Well, Fran wasn’t very muscular, so she looked like a punch.  Perhaps dissatisfied with that, Fran stopped pose immediately with a smug look on her face and slashed at the undead. There were eight of them in all.Perhaps dissatisfied with this, Fran immediately paused her pose with a smug look on her face and slashed at the undead.  They landed eight hits in one hit.  However, Donadrond and Fran’s efforts had boosted the momentum of the surrounding adventurers and further increased the speed of their undead’s annihilation.  Although Mareficent wasn’t very conspicuous, I could see that his support was tremendous.  He used provoking skills to draw enemies, while putting up barriers and buffs on the surrounding adventurers. He also used debuffs to weaken their enemies, which was surprisingly all-powerful.  The same went for Persona. He used warding magic and ocean magic to support the adventurers.  Chardman, the enemy commander, was defeated, and the scavengers who created the undead were all defeated by the ghouls. The enemy’s chain of command was already in tatters.  Even though Forrund and Urushi had temporarily left, the tide was turning in this direction. The white light that Donad had already emitted was cut off, but it was no longer a problem.  The number of enemies was steadily decreasing. If we could afford to do so, it could become a problem.  </p>
<p>「What about that undead?」</p>
<p>「I feel like I’m sensing evil...」</p>
<p>「Seriously?」</p>
<p>  Those who sensed evil spirits began to talk about the unusualness of the Avengers. Donadrond seemed to know too, and he seemed to be somewhat wary of Avengers. As I thought, it was unlikely that he could be just a undead spirit. Even Fran, who was using the ghouls that scattered such evil spirits, was staring at them from a distance.  </p>
<p>「Hey! Who are you!?」</p>
<p>  It seems that one of the nobles who survived had the ability to sense evil spirits. He must have been worried when a suspicious ghoul appeared where he was physically and mentally battered by the battle.  He pointed at us and shouted. He was not a noble that was very well-liked by the people around him, but the loudness of his voice could not be made fun of. Soldiers, knights, and some of the adventurers seemed to be starting to doubt Fran.  </p>
<p>「I’m Fran.  B-ranked adventurer」</p>
<p>「Umm, that undead!  What’s that undead with an evil aura!?  I-I don’t think you’re a believer in the Evil God!」</p>
<p>  So, what should we do now? Mareficent and the others seemed to be completely strangers, and Donadrond would also like to know what’s going on.  I wondered how to explain it to him.  As I was wondering, Fran was moving first. For some reason, she stepped forward with a smug look on her face and held me aloft to show it to everyone. </p>
<p>「All of this thanks to this sword」</p>
<p>「What?  It certainly looks like a very powerful magic sword, but...」</p>
<p>「This super amazing sword has the power to control and control evil energy!」</p>
<p>「I-I’ve never even heard of such power!  Don’t tell a lie!」</p>
<p>「Fufun.  But it’s true. Besides, there’s also something else amazing about it, the Divine-level blacksmith’s super amazing sword!」</p>
<p>「Oooh!  My priestess!」</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Mico-yo!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>  Avengers knelt, uttering a few words of reverence to Fran.  They must have been trying to show that they were under her control......  Too much on purpose! If I had told them to trust me with this――  </p>
<p>「M-Could it be, a Divine Sword?」</p>
<p>「No. But it was made by a Divine level blacksmith」</p>
<p>「Oooh!  What a surprise!」</p>
<p>  Huh?  This nobleman didn’t believe it.  Wasn’t he too easy to believe?  But he must have seen Fran’s battle before, and he should be able to tell that I was not any magic sword from around here. If so, is it surprisingly reliable?  Besides, now that we’ve suffered a lot of damage in the enemy area, he might want someone who could cling to anything.Besides, now that they had suffered a great deal of damage in the enemy area, they might want someone who could cling to anything they want.  Donadrond didn’t seem to believe that Fran was lying.  There was even more support for him.  </p>
<p>「I’ll give you a guarantee」</p>
<p>「Ooh!  Forrund-san!  So, you’re safe!」</p>
<p>「So you’re the Forrund of the Hundred Swords!」</p>
<p>「Yeah」</p>
<p>  It was Forrund who had returned with Urushi.  Even though he looked down on the adventurers, if he was an A-ranked adventurer, he would be treated differently. Because of this Forrund’s assurance, the nobles and the others seemed to have calmed down somewhat as if they were just like that swordsmanship.  Their doubts about Fran would have almost disappeared.  I’m glad that they didn’t have to be treated as admirers of the Evil God in this enemy area. It seems that it was also good that the Avengers did not counterattack the adventurers when they attacked them and only defeated the undead.  </p>
<p>(Hmm?  Amazing magic power!)</p>
<p>『From the fort!』</p>
<p> For a while, the Avengers were accepted and relieved.  A tremendous amount of magic power was emanating from the fort.</p>
<p>『So she was the one who kept quiet after all!』</p>
