</div><h1>Chapter 1139</h1><p>「Ave――She’s not going to die! Who is manipulating the undead? A scavenger?」</p>
<p>「No, you’re wrong! I’ve already defeated most of them! And I’m sure Onslaught will be a ghost mixed with evil energy. So, let’s take the third seat of the Black Skeleton Corps, the substitute Wickerman!」</p>
<p>「A substitute wickerman.」</p>
<p>「As the name suggests, he is a rather resilient one who has the ability to transform the undead under his control into a substitute」</p>
<p>They also explained before we came to the battlefield, that he was a type that used shield techniques to transfer damage. Moreover, it would be seriously troublesome if he could create a long number of underlings himself.</p>
<p>Fran explained it to the other adventurers again, perhaps to make them aware of it. The hole in Avenger’s stomach had already been filled, so he was already moving around. So, there wouldn’t be a problem here.</p>
<p>「Aah, and that alias is not just about ability!」</p>
<p>「What do you mean?」</p>
<p>This was the first time we’ve ever heard of it either.</p>
<p>「It’s also Nameless’ Shadow Warrior, the first seat of the group! He even has an Appraisal Disguising ability! I guess it’s over now! The looks are very similar, so it would be hard to see through them. Well, I’ve found out about it here! Fuhahaha!」</p>
<p>Avenger smiled happily as he prevented the flame magic from flying from the fort. But isn’t this quite important information? It wasn’t just about his enemy’s abilities, but also the shadow warrior information of his enemy boss.</p>
<p>「The total number of the Crimson Flame Knights must have been about 300, so there is hardly anything left in the fort.」</p>
<p>In other words, the only people we needed to be careful with in that fort were the Knights of the Crimson Flame and Wickerman. We should attack the fort by leaving this to someone.</p>
<p>「Maleficent!」</p>
<p>「We’ll be coming with you!」</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>Before Fran could say anything, Mareficent said something with a serious look on her face. Persona nodded silently with her too.</p>
<p>But how can we support this battlefield where Dullahan is springing up in large numbers without using any magic cents? Donadrond was too worn out to even use the defensive radiance anymore. The adventurers were doing their best, but their opponents were too bad.</p>
<p>However, it seemed that it wasn’t just Filuria who said that, she also thought so.</p>
<p>「The main idea is that we have what we need leftover, don’t we? Wait a minute. Oh, Persona, please heal Forrund-san.」</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>「I need Forrund-san’s help. Besides, that fort is... I’ll be counting on you」</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>She then looked up at my partner as if to ask something. For some reason, Marefiscent bowed her head to her.</p>
<p>It’s not like they’re using telepathy, but they seem to understand each other.</p>
<p>Then Persona approached Forrund. Forrund was too worn out to use his trump card, and he was unable to make any flashy attacks with his sword. He had managed to fight against Dullahan, but it was unlikely that he would be able to achieve anything more.</p>
<p>When she stood behind Forrund, she put her hands together in front of her chest as if she was praying. Naturally, the undead attacked her, but the barrier prevented everything. Just like I thought, Persona must have a high level of warding skills.</p>
<p>As I watched over her with such thoughts, a surprised scene unfolded.</p>
<p>「Aah―...」</p>
<p>「!! Persona spoke!」</p>
<p>『Y-yeah. What’s more, there’s a ton of magic power!』</p>
<p>The persona, who I had thought she couldn’t speak, uttered a thin but pretty voice from her mouth. Immediately after, she covered her surroundings with a huge amount of magic power.</p>
<p>A wavering, raging magic power that looked exactly like the word “swirling” in front of me. I was worried that I might not be able to control it well.</p>
<p>「Raaaaaah―」</p>
<p>Song, huh? Persona’s voice was calm and without intonation, yet at the same time, it had a mysterious and enchanting voice.</p>
<p>For a few seconds, her voice echoed through the battlefield, magic power dancing in response to the song. Then, Forrund was enveloped in light.</p>
<p>「This is......」</p>
<p>I could feel the magic power filling Forrund’s body.</p>
<p>This reminded me of Sophie’s magical song. Unlike recovery magic, this was a power that healed the opponent’s fundamental fatigue and exhaustion. It seemed that Persona had the same kind of power as me.</p>
<p>However, there seemed to be a reason why he didn’t use it easily.</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>「Persona, are you okay?」</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>Persona fluttered for a moment, and Mareficent took it and held it. Apparently, she was too worn out to stand. I could tell how exhausted she was by the waterfall of sweat that floated around her neck.</p>
<p>What did she mean by this in a matter of seconds...? I guess there was a reason why she didn’t usually talk back.</p>
<p>「Personality did her best too, so I have to do my best too」</p>
<p>With Persona in her arms, Mareficent stepped forward this time.</p>
<p>「Well then...」</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>Everyone around them, who had been watching over them while fighting, gasped in surprise. To their surprise, Mareficent bit them slowly on his wrist and devoured them wildly.</p>
<p>Of course, a large amount of blood would flow out, making his feet redder and wetter. But that was exactly what Marellisent was aiming for.</p>
<p>His blood did not penetrate the earth, it flowed unnaturally to create something like a pattern. It was a magic circle about three meters in diameter.</p>
<p>「I give my blood. Answer the call, great demon! Summon!」</p>
<p>To my surprise, it seems that Murphysent could use a demon. I could see a strong magical presence about to appear from the Blood Magic Beastmen Union.</p>
