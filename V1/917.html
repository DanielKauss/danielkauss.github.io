</div><h1>Chapter 917</h1><p>Riding on Urushi’s back, she ran through Sendia. Her legs were much stronger than I had imagined, climbing up the walls of the building and running through it as fast as I could.</p>
<p>But the results were not looking good.</p>
<p>Naturally, our first destination was the tower. That’s when we tried to ask the soldiers for help, but......</p>
<p>Most of the soldiers had just arrived at the gates. Moreover, Seliadot was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>The Chief Soldier, who was in command, looked at me and twisted his face. He clearly thought I was in his way.</p>
<p>No matter how much we asked him, he wouldn’t let us send our soldiers. He’ll protect this tower, won’t the other forces trust us? What was he saying when this town was about to be destroyed?</p>
<p>Even if they directly appealed to the soldiers still in the tower, they would not move because they were ordered by the Chief Soldier. They would probably only leave someone under their command in the tower.</p>
<p>I wondered what they were doing, but they had been evacuating a variety of valuables. Money, ornaments, medicine, and other supplies were packed into evacuation item bags and brought out.</p>
<p>Money in this critical situation? How stupid. We couldn’t rely on this as soon as possible.</p>
<p>At the very least, our salvation would be that there were very few patients left. Seliadot must have ordered us to evacuate.</p>
<p>I gave up the support from the tower and decided to go somewhere else. Mea-san and Velmeria-san must have been working together for the Beastmen Union and the Dragon King Syndicate. Then I decided to go to the Adventurers Guild next. That’s what I thought...</p>
<p>There were very few people in the guild. Many adventurers had already moved to the defense of the gate.</p>
<p>There were quite a few antidemons rushing over to them, so they couldn’t afford to reduce their numbers. They also said that the remaining adventurers could not reduce them to protect the guild.</p>
<p>Once a city was destroyed, they had nothing to do with the organization...... But this was no different here?</p>
<p>When she shouted further that she needed troops, a man named the submaster yelled at her. Apparently, he had prepared to escape from the city. He had apparently left behind some adventurers under his command as his escort.</p>
<p>How could they be the only ones who would try to escape at a time like this...? I couldn’t rely on the Adventurers Guild either. Then I thought they would cooperate with a small organization......</p>
<p>「Saintess-san. Sorry, I’m afraid it won’t be immediately. I want as many people as I can.」</p>
<p>「I understand how tough it is! But it’s still a crisis for this town!」</p>
<p>「I’ll make good use of our share of forces.」</p>
<p>「It won’t be possible as usual! It’s fine if there are just a few people here!」</p>
<p>「We can’t reduce the security here. If the other gangs are committed to deploying, we can follow them too.」</p>
<p>They didn’t trust the other organizations, and were wary of fire thief. They would do the same wherever they went. Some of them just paid in advance. I guess none of the organizations wanted to reduce their own forces as much as possible.</p>
<p>On the contrary, some organizations were even preparing to escape. Some of them promised to send people, but there were really few of them.</p>
<p>We went around to many small organizations like that, but they ended up not achieving great results. I couldn’t waste any more time.</p>
<p>「...Why? You don’t want to protect this city?」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>「You’re comforting me?」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Urushi licked his cheeks. I could feel his mood being at the beatings next to him. But even Urushi, who had left his master, Fran, must have been in a hurry.</p>
<p>I shouldn’t have stopped in a place like this.</p>
<p>But then things suddenly changed. With a deafening cracking sound, the eastern wall of the city was destroyed.</p>
<p>I wonder if Fran and her friends were safe? Even if they were safe, that would not be enough to prevent the antidemons from entering the city.</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Y-you’re right. You shouldn’t give up」</p>
<p>They were absolutely in need of help. That was why I decided to go further, but I couldn’t get a promise of reinforcements.</p>
<p>After seeing the destroyed city walls, everyone started thinking about escaping. Some of them made fun of me for fighting.</p>
<p>「...It’s so pathetic!」</p>
<p>As I walked out of the building, I couldn’t help but cry.</p>
<p>All of them were pitiful. They had to cling to their own worthlessness, or even to the fact that they usually would run away in their hour of need.</p>
<p>「Umm, Saintess-sama...? Are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Eh?」</p>
<p>It was a few men who approached me. They were ordinary citizens living in this city, carrying a large cloth bag on their backs.</p>
<p>Seeing him on the way out of the city, I cried even more. Many residents of the city thought that they could no longer escape.</p>
<p>And Fran was risking her life to protect this city.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I saw the spear on the men’s backs. Everyone in this city took it for granted that they had weapons.</p>
<p>That was to counter criminals. No matter how many agreements they have between organizations that do not want to touch the civilians, some of them do not. Besides, many of them inherited it from their ancestors.</p>
<p>After thinking that far, I suddenly realized that I couldn’t fight them. If they had a weapon, maybe at least a lesser antidemon――.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, that was impossible. She probably didn’t even think that way in the first place. But after being cornered, I couldn’t help but keep her mouth open.</p>
<p>「I have people fighting to protect this city.」</p>
<p>「Eh? What?」</p>
<p>「But if things continue like this, the city might be destroyed. Could you join us in a fight?」</p>
<p>「Eh? No, no, that’s impossible!」</p>
<p>「Yeah, we’ve never fought in a real fight before!」</p>
<p>「We leave it to you!」</p>
<p>「No no no, I’m afraid I won’t!」</p>
<p>「Yes, that’s right!」</p>
<p>「The ones fighting for me might be annihilated too!」</p>
<p>Naturally, no matter how much I asked them, the men just kept making excuses. It was only natural.</p>
<p>They had no strength or preparation for battle. They were on the side of being protected, after all.</p>
<p>「We can just leave the fight to those who want to fight! It’s not like we ordered them to fight! It’s not like we knew what she was saying!」</p>
<p>「Yo-you’re right! They’re doing their job! Even if they die, it’s their responsibility!」</p>
<p>「......I don’t want to be told such a thing.」</p>
<p>So this is the people of this city...... To help these people, Fran and Urushi......</p>
<p>Despair. All I could say was that.</p>
<p>That’s already impossible. This city will be destroyed. If that’s the case, we can at least go to Fran and Katley and help them escape.</p>
<p>That was when I thought about it.</p>
<p>「What nonsense are you saying! This inn, six!」</p>
<p>「Bugeh! M-Mom!」</p>
<p>「Have you ever heard of the soldiers? I’ll protect you at all times, and what’s the point of that!」</p>
<p>「Yo-you’re right」</p>
<p>「Silence! You’ve probably left me alone to try to escape, haven’t you? This scum!」</p>
<p>「Gubwoof!」</p>
<p>Umm, I wondered if this old lady was this man’s wife. I suddenly thought she was starting a argument, but she punched the man in the face to shut him up.</p>
<p>It seemed that the other men’s wives were also there, so they ended up being beaten and looked a little shaggy. I didn’t feel like healing them though.</p>
<p>「Umm, who are you guys?」</p>
<p>870: Knights of the Holy Land</p>
<p>「I’m Merry, the second shopping street lady president.」</p>
<p>「I’m Bassa, the fifth district woman president!」</p>
<p>The ladies were bowing their heads one after another. And behind them, I could feel the presence of many people running.</p>
<p>I could hear thousands of footsteps. I could see the numbers of people filling the main street coming towards us, with brave expressions on their faces.</p>
<p>In her hand, holding the weapon of her choice.</p>
<p>「Forget what these selfish bokenas say」</p>
<p>「That’s only a small part of me!」</p>
<p>「Yeah. I knew it would be useless, but I never thought it would have been this useless...... When we get back, we’ll be separated from each other!」</p>
<p>「Ours too! Let’s just take them here and throw them out onto the front line!」</p>
<p>T-That’s reliable.</p>
<p>「We’re from this city! If we send people to fight, we can just run away! We’ll have to fight just in case!」</p>
<p>「That’s right! Everyone feels the same way! Don’t you just abandon those who are fighting for you!?」</p>
<p>「Saintess-sama, let’s go together! You know your friends are doing their best, right? Let’s help them!」</p>
<p>「Yes... Yes!」</p>
