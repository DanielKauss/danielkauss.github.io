</div><h1>Chapter 924</h1><p>「Eyes!」</p>
<p> Mea clutched her eyes and screamed. She never thought she would let herself get caught up in the light of the Divine Sword...... If the steel wolves hadn’t been kicking the antidemons around her, it might have been quite dangerous. </p>
<p>「G-Gugyah?」</p>
<p> Rhynd――No, even Rhyndwilm was confused, wasn’t it? She was looking down on her master, who was screaming at her feet. Yes, the Lindwilm that appeared was very large, just like the legends said. It was probably nearly 100 meters long. It was probably nearly 100 meters long.  It was more than twice as huge as the water dragon I had seen before.  The power released was also enormous. When we encounter a dragon of this level, we usually think of running away first.  Well, its dignity is also ruined by the Lord.  He has energetically surrounded Mea with his tail to protect her from the antidemons that attack.  </p>
<p>「Nnnn...... It never glowed so bright!  I knew it!」</p>
<p>「Grrrr!」</p>
<p>「Nrrr?  R-Rhyndo?  Fuhahaha! Didn’t you put on a brave look!?」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  It may be an emotional scene, but why is the smell so strong?! Anyway, it’s not the time to be in a tizzy mood right now!  </p>
<p>『Mea!  The antidemons are our first priority!』</p>
<p>「Oops, that’s right!」</p>
<p>  Mea knew who I was.  So, you don’t have to worry about talking to her. It seems she quickly regained her composure.  </p>
<p>「Hmmm.  Five strong antidemons, huh......?  Lind, I’ll leave the antidemons around you to you! annihilate the small fry!」</p>
<p>「Grrrroogh!」</p>
<p>  We defeat the commander and Lind prevents the small fry from heading to the city. Lind’s ability to form a wall was perfect for his role.  </p>
<p>「We’ll be their commander. Are you awake now?」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「Of course!」</p>
<p>  No one disagreed with Mea’s words.  Her words had a dignity that made them naturally want to obey. Perhaps the charisma-like stuff has been strengthened by the enhancement.  Her appearance was also a little more intimidating than usual.  Although she didn’t have the same petite face as Zefmate, her hair was longer and her long zanbara hair was just like that of her father, the Beast King. Her long zanbara hair was just like that of her father, the Beast King.  It wasn’t just the length of her hair that looked similar, but she also had the feel of it.  As one would expect from parent and child.  Her fearsome and violent atmosphere and her belligerent smile seemed to prove that they were parent and child.  Right now, Mea was the King. </p>
<p>「Okay, let’s go!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  Then, the five of them challenge themselves to the commander in front of them.  </p>
<p>「This is my opponent!」</p>
<p>『As expected of Fran!  You’ve chosen to be the strongest one!』</p>
<p>(Master, use the wolves to hunt the small fry around him)</p>
<p>『Okay!』</p>
<p>  Fran chose the smallest sword in her hand, but with the highest magic power contained.  I could tell that it was a sword in her hand. It was a crimson knight-type with three long horns.  The three horns also seemed to have seen Fran as an enemy. She stepped forward and held her head silently.  It was as if a warrior was applying for battle in front of a strong enemy. An antidemon shouldn’t have any personality, but he might have some personality as a commander.  Fran and the others were glaring at each other. </p>
<p>「Uraaaaaah!」</p>
<p>「Shaaaaaah!」</p>
<p>  Fran and the three horns entered the fray in an instant. They swung around and cut to pieces at blinding speeds. The shockwave alone sent the high-ranking antidemons around us flying.  I see, since it was a light-weight type, its speed was terrifying.  Moreover, it had high regenerative power. If he hadn’t been strengthened by Sophie’s song, we would have had a hard time. He might have been an opponent I couldn’t even tell if I could win against with Potential Release. But now we were evenly matched.  Our speed was even faster than before, even surpassing our swordsmanship.  Our regeneration power was now evenly matched. Even when cut down by an antidemon sword, it was regenerating in an instant.  And when it comes to weapons, I can’t compare them. After all, I was currently performing so well.  </p>
<p>(Master, Evil Spirit.  Is it okay?)</p>
<p>『Oops, a little leak!  Don’t worry, don’t worry!』</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
<p> There was a slight hint of evil in the Divine Spirit I was clad in.  Fran seemed to feel uneasy about my condition, but it’s not a problem at all. The evil spirit was a little too great, and I only have a little less control over it.  It may be a normal problem, but I don’t have the negative effects of evil spirits.  It was almost the same as when I was overflowing with magic power. The current Fran could completely ignore Evil Spirits of this level, and with this level, it really wouldn’t have any effect.  Evil Spirits and Divine Spirits.  On top of that, the effects of the Golden Devourer skill were also added.  The Golden Devourer skill was a modified version of Overgrowth’s Golden Devourer skill.  The ability to absorb power from antidemons was eliminated, and the antidemon ability was enhanced.  Even if this skill slashed antidemons, they wouldn’t turn into antidemons like Nadia’s. Thanks to this, we were able to use it with peace of mind.  </p>
<p>「Shhhh!  Seei!」</p>
<p>  Fran was already so fast that she left her shadow behind, but she accelerated even faster. She was probably completely used to the physical abilities that had been raised by the Divine Beast Transformation.  Moreover, she was moving at a tremendous pace, making it look like she was teleporting for a moment.  It seemed that in her Divine Beast Transformation state, she could use the Black Lightning Roll at will.  Normally, the speed was so godlike that it was doubtful how she could even know how Fran was moving. At such a high speed, the blood that was gushing out of Fran’s wound turned into an instant mist and disappeared into the air.  Fran had complete control over such speed. Not only had her muscles increased, but her ability to sense movement and space seemed to have been strengthened.  Right now, Fran wouldn’t have to use time acceleration to see everything around her slow. I couldn’t get there without using time acceleration.  So, this was the world that the Rank S transcendents were seeing, huh?  Even Fran right now would not be able to beat Ashwrath and Weena Rhyn.  They were making full use of their own power. However, there was no doubt that they were plunging one leg into their territory.  </p>
<p>「Teyaaa!」</p>
<p>「Shwiiiiiii!」</p>
<p>  They were too fast. Even now that Fran was in a Divine Beast state, I could see her body was starting to scream.  This antidemon separating her from Fran head-on was probably quite extraordinary.  I never thought that there would be several such vicious antidemons... It must be really dangerous in the antidemon season.  But, no matter how fast or strong, it is, it is no match for Fran.</p>
<p>「Ruaaaaaaaa!」</p>
