</div><h1>Chapter 1047</h1><p>「Miss Hilt, it was really hard work. I’ve received the report and I’m satisfied with her work. I’ve completed the request. I’ll also give you a bonus for paying」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「But still, your trip to Gordicia this time was messed up. You really saved us thanks to Miss Hilt and the others」</p>
<p> Fran was facing Brunen in the captain’s office. The journey was a long one, but the return journey was different. She needed to write the documents and reports that she needed to submit on her way back. We had to write the documents and reports we had to submit on our way back home.  Some of them, like Fran, were burned up halfway through. Even in Gordicia, we wouldn’t be able to see Fran’s eyes like she didn’t do that. However, it was also worth it, and Fran’s request was approved as being fully accomplished. </p>
<p>「We’ve told them to hold a drinking party, but since we’re leaving, we’ll have to carry a lot of supplies」</p>
<p>「We have no choice」</p>
<p>「They want me to tell them to go back, but that doesn’t seem to be possible. When we return to the country, we’ll have to go to the border right away」</p>
<p>「Jobs?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. The border seems to be messing up, and I came all the way here with a bird」</p>
<p>  The border of Belios Kingdom? I think it also borders several countries, right?  </p>
<p>「Raidos?」</p>
<p>「Yes.  It seems that there are large-scale drills in the country on the other side. I don’t think they’ll suddenly cross the border though...」</p>
<p>「Raidos might do it」</p>
<p>「That’s what he said. Thanks to that, those in their posts as generals should wait at the border in case of emergencies」</p>
<p> It would be difficult for them to return from the tempest of the continent of Gordisia and immediately activate them.  </p>
<p>「All of your money was spent on money, right?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Then I’ll transfer it to your guild account.  Thank you for your help this time. It’s also thanks to you that we made friends with Hilt and the others.」</p>
<p>  Apparently, Brunen has made a re-deal with Hilt and the others. If a Rank A adventurer is added to the defense of the border, it will be the best deterrent.  </p>
<p>「Thank you for a lot of things.」</p>
<p>「We too.」</p>
<p>  Finally, we shook Brunen’s hand and left the captain’s office. At this, everything about the Gordician-related matters was over.  Fran looked bright and shining as she stretched out her head. She no longer had to write the documents, and she must be feeling liberated from it.  </p>
<p>『Well, it’s over.  When we return to the continent of Jilbard, we’ll be at the Academy of Magic』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  That was where we got the Heavenly Dragon’s materials. Because that was her first goal.  </p>
<p>『I’m also interested in Raydoss’s moves, but I’ll ask Weena about that too』</p>
<p>「Alessa, are you okay?」</p>
<p>『Well, Amanda and Jean are here, and I’m sure they’ll be fine. Klimut is there too』</p>
<p> We’ll need a Rank S-ranked force to make our way through that town.  </p>
<p>「Certainly」</p>
<p>「Woof」</p>
<p>「I’ll fix this when we get back to the Academy of Magic」</p>
<p>『Are they okay in the Royal Capital?』</p>
<p>  What Fran pulled out was a broken mug. It was a memento with her parents that she had dug out at Castel.  In the hurried continent of Gordicia, alchemists were not captured. I was expecting the dwarves to fix it for us, but wouldn’t they ask for a royalty? In the end, she decided to slowly look for alchemists when she returned to the continent of Jilbard. </p>
<p>『There must be many alchemists in the Royal Capital of Belioth』</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>  Fran was hungry, perhaps relieved by my words.  </p>
<p>「I’m hungry」</p>
<p>『Then, let’s have our food!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>  Just a few days later, the ship was in a hurry to enjoy its calm voyage. It was not that they were preparing to call us. We went out onto deck and asked the crew members about it.  </p>
<p>「What’s wrong?」</p>
<p>「The harbor is burning!」</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p> Now that you mention it, we saw a red light quite far from here. It looked like a spot, but it stood out in the darkness of the night.  Many of the crew members had teleportation skills. They must have confirmed that the source of the fire was the harbor.  And that was not the only strange thing.  </p>
<p>「The fleet is coming this way! It looks like they have been completely captured!」</p>
<p>「The fleet?」</p>
<p>  When I looked in the direction of the red flame, I saw a ship coming towards us. They must have found the light of our ship. Moreover, there was no way for the crew members to panic――  </p>
<p>「Enemy?」</p>
<p>「I’ll raise the emblem of the Kingdom of Raidos.  And also the emblem of the Sea of Seedran」</p>
<p>『Sheedran? It was indeed a landlocked country located in the west of the Kranzel Kingdom, right?』</p>
<p>  It was supposed to be a country that possessed a powerful battle ship called the Water Dragon Ship and was one of the most powerful naval forces in the world. It had fought against the royalty, who had lost a political battle in the Sea of Seedran and escaped from there before. </p>
<p>「Are the Raidos Kingdom and the Seedran Sea Kingdom getting along?」</p>
<p>「Apparently, Raidos had made Seedran subordinate」</p>
<p> So, in other words, they were practically the Raidos’ naval force.  </p>
<p>「What is the water dragon ship?」</p>
<p>「I don’t understand.  But they’re obviously chasing after us, and it’s not going to be easy by any stretch of the imagination...」</p>
<p>  I guess what they’re trying to say is that they were on a run.  There was no way that they would be captured by a military ship of the Raydoss Kingdom and have a good result. Certainly, they should have escaped.  Fortunately, the water dragonkin was not there, and we managed to escape. It seems that they didn’t want to catch anything in the first place. It was the ship of their enemy, Belioth, so they probably just chased us for the time being.  </p>
<p>「Hmmm. You’ve come to the south, haven’t you?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, we’re already in the southern part of Jilbard」</p>
<p>「Food is quite tough, we’ll have seven more days to spare.  We’ll have to replenish it somewhere」</p>
<p> They had taken a south route to escape from the Raidos Kingdom, and as a result, it was flowing to the south side of the continent. In the first place, in order to return to the inland country of Belios, we had to make a call somewhere and move by land route. However, it was not possible to leave the ship to someone they didn’t even know if they could trust, and even if they wanted to move by land, it would be quite difficult to go north from the south. If that was the case, it would be convenient for a country that could be trusted and was close to Belios.  </p>
<p>「It’s the Kranzel Kingdom」</p>
<p>「It’s probably the only one that can do that. The small countries in the south are in a situation where they don’t know which part of the country is connected to Raidos」</p>

<p>「It’s the Kranzel Kingdom」</p>
<p>「That’s all I can do. The small countries in the south are in a situation where they don’t know which part of the country is connected to Raidos」</p>
<p> And so, we decided to hurry to Barbra, a port city in the Kranzel Kingdom.</p>
