</div><h1>Chapter 932</h1><p>Three days after Fran woke up.</p>
<p>We arrived in front of the wall that had been destroyed by the bombardment. The residents had set up simple fences and such, and the repairs had already begun.</p>
<p>However, it was not easily possible to fix the destroyed wall over a wide area, and it was expected to take several months to complete.</p>
<p>We fought back from our last assault, but we didn’t know what would happen next. It was currently the antidemon season.</p>
<p>That’s where Fran comes in.</p>
<p>「We’ll be counting on you here!」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>The beastman guiding us was about ten meters before the wall was under repair. There was a long rope stretched out to make it easier to understand.</p>
<p>Fran stood in front of him and started chanting. He could use it without chanting, but with chanting, it consumes less magic power.</p>
<p>「――Great Wall.」</p>
<p>「Uwooooh! T-This is awesome!」</p>
<p>What we did was a huge earth wall. Just in time for the complete restoration of the city wall, we were asked to build a simple wall with earth magic.</p>
<p>I used Great Wall in succession to create a long, high wall in front of the collapsed site. There was a small gap between the city walls and the earth walls at both ends of the wall, but the beastmen were said to bury it with earth.</p>
<p>It would be completely meaningless against high-level antidemons, but it would be fine to prevent the entry of low-level antidemons. We could just break down the wall once the antidemons had repaired it, and it would be a good first aid.</p>
<p>And with over 2,000 reinforcements coming from Nocta, the northern and western ports, Sendia’s defenses were ready as long as we were not attacked by tens of thousands of antidemons.</p>
<p>「As expected of the Black Lightning Princess! Thank you very much!」</p>
<p>「「「Thank you very much!」」」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>The beastmen had completely become their underlings, huh? Mea was their boss, and Fran was their sister. Velmeria was the dragonkin.</p>
<p>The beastmen lower their backs and bowed their heads, just like Fran, were watching her off. She must feel good, as if she was being recognized by the beastmen too.</p>
<p>And it wasn’t just the beastmen who bowed their heads.</p>
<p>「Hmm? Swordsman from the Black Cat kin! Hello!」</p>
<p>「Thank you very much, Black Lightning Princess-dono」</p>
<p>「Aah, now that’s the onee-chan for the black cat!」</p>
<p>After all, I’d heard that many people call out to us wherever we go.</p>
<p>The civilians we fought with, the adventurers, and outlaws. All of them witnessed Fran and the others risking their lives to destroy the antidemons, and they were also proud of the fact that they had helped us.</p>
<p>As a result, she became very popular everywhere as the hero who saved this city with us.</p>
<p>She had even seen the children fight with Fran and Urushi before they played the role of heroes.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of supplies, the old man gave us food and some of the adults even stroked his head. Fran was particularly young and small in the group, so it seemed that some of them were more cared for.</p>
<p>However, not all people were friendly.</p>
<p>「Oi!」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>「You’re the Black Lightning Princess! How can you compete with me!」</p>
<p>「I failed to hold back a little」</p>
<p>Many of them were idiots who wanted to defeat Fran and make a name for themselves.</p>
<p>Apparently, she had annihilated the horde of antidemons, but she didn’t look very strong. Some of them attacked us, simply thinking that they were lucky.</p>
<p>All of them were weaklings. Those in power knew there was no way they could survive an antidemon horde with just luck, and Fran could tell what they were capable of by just looking at them.</p>
<p>From Fran’s point of view, it was just right for exercise. She happily fought back the moment she was turned in hostility.</p>
<p>However, it seemed that she made a slight mistake in adjusting her strength because of muscle pain, and she always needed Greater Heal.</p>
<p>The most common one was the fools who tried to take in Fran. They may have decent fighting prowess, but they are still the girls of brain muscle beastmen after all. Many of them could deceive Fran in their own way.</p>
<p>They ranged in status from small organizations that lost power and were looking for strength, to adventurers who wanted to add Fran to their party, and former powerful people who wanted to intercede with their superiors.</p>
<p>Most of them would intimidate us and give up if they say they won’t work because they’re not at their full strength. And as long as they stayed put, they would just use their strength.</p>
<p>Some of them told us to take responsibility for the injuries, but all we had to do was to ask the guards. The soldiers who were working hard right now were all grateful for Fran, so they believed only Fran’s words, which made me a little uneasy.</p>
<p>I don’t mean to do it, but I think it’s going to be so easy as to get false accusations. I wonder why Quina and Frederick were so easily able to drive away such a hostile opponent...</p>
<p>I guess that’s just how grateful she is to Fran for saving this town.</p>
<p>Also, some of them had a grudge against us.</p>
<p>Some of them abandoned this town and escaped. I have mixed feelings, but I don’t think I can’t help but think that it is only natural for those who don’t have the power to resist to evacuate in the case of a magic beast disaster.</p>
<p>However, this time it was different from a normal Magic Beast disaster. When everything was over and they came back immediately, the people around them would not forgive us. After all, the remaining ones had to risk their lives to fight.</p>
<p>Many of them stole things from the neighboring families as cheap money to go to town. Most of them were captured by the residents, and those who were allowed to go were in fact needles.</p>
<p>Fran herself, like me, seemed to have nothing to do with those who have escaped.</p>
<p>They were not the adventurers we were asked to go to, so it was only natural that we would run away if we couldn’t confront them. We were not going to blame or despise anyone who ran away. Even we would run away if an enemy we couldn’t win showed up.</p>
<p>Fran thought so seriously. I guess that was her ideal of a calm, rational, and free adventurer.</p>
<p>I’m sure he’ll try to challenge himself when that happens.</p>
<p>They just abandoned it as long as it escaped. It seems that they were negative about how it was trying to go back with just an apology.</p>
<p>You are free to run away, and not to blame. But as long as you do, you should be responsible for your choice. That’s just Fran’s opinion.</p>
<p>And the fact that she had encountered the scene of their dispute and told them that was also the reason for her resentment. Now that the story had spread among the people coming and going, the Black Lightning Princess seemed to think that she was planning to kick them out. No, it was not completely wrong though.</p>
<p>Even now, they were just staring at her like that. Fran’s relatives, no matter how harshly she was told, didn’t have the feeling that they had helped her. But Fran herself didn’t seem to care at all.</p>
<p>『Fran, are you okay?』</p>
<p>(What is it?)</p>
<p>『Now that you mention it...』</p>
<p>(Nn. Disappointing. It was weak. It won’t be a good experience for me)</p>
<p>『Yeah, over there...』</p>
<p>The hostility coming from the civilians was no match for the horde of antidemons.</p>
<p>(Maybe someone a little stronger?)</p>
