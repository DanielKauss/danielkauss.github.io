</div><h1>Chapter 1067</h1><p>「Use my magic power and my body as the sacrifice to reveal it! Wind magic!」</p>
<p>Immediately after the demon knight shouted, the magic around him changed drastically.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just an increase and enhancement. The swirling mana in the air was so intense that it looked like a storm itself.</p>
<p>Its wings were also a bit larger, and it had a long tail at the tip that looked like a claw.</p>
<p>「It’s been a while.」</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>「Little girl! Thanks to you resisting! I’ll be grateful! Thank you, I’ll kill you in an instant!」</p>
<p>After shouting in a hoarse voice, which was not similar to before, the demon knights threw their magic at us.</p>
<p>「Shatter it! Gyahahahaha!」</p>
<p>The bullets rotated at high speeds like a tornado. Indeed, they were powerful enough to be shattered by an ordinary person.</p>
<p>When I appraised it again, I found that its race had changed into a demon. Not only had it possessed, but it had also changed from a physical to a demon.</p>
<p>There was almost no change in her skills, but her stats had been significantly enhanced. Most of her stats had exceeded 500, her magic power had exceeded 1,000, and her title had an increase in Demon Baron.</p>
<p>After he became a demon, he became able to cast magic without chanting. He then began to swing his arms in rapid succession and scattered wind bullets everywhere.</p>
<p>「Ora ora ora!」</p>
<p>「Silence, Hilt.」</p>
<p>However, Fran dodged her attack and intercepted only the ones that were about to hit with me.</p>
<p>「Hah? What the hell is that! You cut through my wind!」</p>
<p>「It’s our turn now!」</p>
<p>『Darya!』</p>
<p>We fired a series of thunder magic at Fran and flame magic at me. Magic struck from all directions, hitting the demons one after another.</p>
<p>But we did not shout out in joy.</p>
<p>「It’s so itchy! I don’t even need to block this level of magic!」</p>
<p>『Tsk! It has high magic defense!』</p>
<p>No matter how low-level magic I used to wait, I didn’t even need a simple defense and didn’t expect it to be ignored. It was more of a defense than I had imagined.</p>
<p>「It’s my turn now!」</p>
<p>Realizing that my point attack wouldn’t hit them, this time it was a line attack. It was a transparent wind scythe that was very hard to see.</p>
<p>Countless wind scythes shot out and attacked Fran from all sides. If she were an adventurer on par with her, her entire body would have been sliced apart and cut into pieces, becoming a deadlock.</p>
<p>However, Fran sensed the scythe without any panic, saw its trajectory and dealt with it.</p>
<p>「How can I see this!?」</p>
<p>「He won’t die.」</p>
<p>「Oruaaaah!」</p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>From then on, it was a fierce magical battle. They scattered fierce magic to each other. However, the two sides were chipping away at each other’s decisive blows and the damage did not go well.</p>
<p>The other side’s wind magic was intercepted by Fran and me, and our magic was blocked by the other side’s high magic defense. It would take a higher level of magic to break through the defense. However, it was difficult to target them because both of them moved too fast.</p>
<p>Besides, even if we could hit her with Kanna Kamui, that might defeat her. We hadn’t given up on trying to capture her yet.</p>
<p>(Master, what’s that magic power?)</p>
<p>『That’s pretty dwindling.』</p>
<p>It seemed that in the middle of the demon’s appearance, it was constantly draining magic power, and the magic power of the demon knights was slowly diminishing. Fran seemed to be planning to continue the battle and aim for the shortage of magic power.</p>
<p>The demon knight seemed to be annoyed by this turn of events. He shouted, jumping around.</p>
<p>「Uwaah! That’s what I’m talking about! I’ll definitely minced you at this point!」</p>
<p>Did they move their hands to form a kind of seal? I don’t know much about it, but the wind and mana around the demon knights had gotten even stronger.</p>
<p>「Wind Destroyer!」</p>
<p>『Not an attack, but a strengthening technique!』</p>
<p>The demon knights, clad in wind armor, accelerated, leaving a splash of wind spears that spun like a drill as they swirled around the sky at the speed of a fighter. The wind spears had a tracking function.</p>
<p>Fran, on the other hand, was clad in black lightning, dodging her opponent with acrobatic movements while using the air as a foothold.</p>
<p>『Damn! This is! That’s harsh!』</p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>『Fran, dodge! I can intercept you and you’ll burst into pieces!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>My slashed wind spear caused a huge explosion and blew Fran away. If I hadn’t quickly teleported and escaped, I would have suffered a lot of damage from the wind spear that rushed even further.</p>
<p>『Fran! You’re still going to hold back a little!』</p>
<p>He wanted to get close and smash them, but the guy didn’t. He knew that Fran had the advantage in slashing.</p>
<p>However, a shoot from a distance would not be a decisive blow. Shouldn’t we get as close to him as we can?</p>
<p>(Don’t worry!)</p>
<p>Fran nodded confidently and descended from the spot at once. Moreover, while lowering her altitude, she ran away from the demon knight with her back facing down.</p>
<p>We were heading in the direction where we could see the village of Metelmam.</p>
<p>The demon knight must have thought she was ignoring him and was going to check the situation in the village.</p>
<p>「H-Hey wait! Don’t ignore me!」</p>
<p>(It!)</p>
<p>『Yeah!』</p>
<p>No matter how capable he is, it’s easy to get caught up in someone’s instincts!</p>
<p>The demon knight was chasing after her at super high speed, but Fran turned around and rushed forward. She hurriedly threw out a spear of wind at him, but as long as she knew the timing, she could easily evade it.</p>
<p>Fran activated the Black Lightning Roll for a moment and passed the spear of wind. She was already close enough to reach her opponent when she reached for it.</p>
<p>「What!」</p>
<p>The astonished demon knight and Fran, who had been aiming for this situation herself, were the ones who led this situation. In battles where both sides were super-high-speed, the slightest difference between them was the difference between their lives.</p>
<p>「Gugaaah!」</p>
<p>I saw the demon knights knocked away from his right arm and his right wings, falling with a cone in his hand.</p>
