</div><h1>Chapter 985</h1><p>「Divine Sword Release!」</p>
<p> Black magic power overflowed from Berserk, who was still in its sheath as if it was responding to the voice of the Great Magic Beast. At the same time, white magic power was gushing out of its sheath as well. White magic power wriggled between the irregular mixture of white and black magic power. The white part that looked like a skull sometimes made me feel annoyed, was it because of my fear of Berserk? The Great Magic Beast then pulled Berserk out of its sheath. Little by little, a jet-black blade appeared and proportionally, its vile magic power then covered the surroundings. </p>
<p>「!」</p>
<p>「Kuhn」</p>
<p>『Run, run!』</p>
<p> Run!』</p>
<p>  Fran and Urushi were sweating coldly even though they were just surrounded by leaky, unintentional magic power.  No, it was not that there was no direct damage but it didn’t have a negative effect.  </p>
<p>『Tsk!  Magic is...!』</p>
<p>  The intense magic power enveloped them made it suddenly more difficult to control their magic. I thought I had teleported, but it didn’t activate properly.  </p>
<p>『Sorry, Fran! Run!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  Fran increased her speed even while caring about the back. However, she did not run straight ahead.  </p>
<p>「Isario!」</p>
<p>「Miss!  Don’t stop! This place may be in danger!」</p>
<p>  She was probably worried about the adventurers running at full speed. She called out to Isario, who had already stopped the Divine Sword Release and looked like Dalfe. He looked exhausted, but still unable to move.  However, his legs were probably quite slow. Besides, the other adventurers were also quite slow compared to Fran. It would take them a while to escape to the safe zone. If they could use magic, they would have been able to gain some distance at the Dimension Gate, but!  Fran then stepped in at the head of the group.  She looked back and began to encourage everyone. It was a rare thing for Fran to raise her voice.  </p>
<p>「Guys!  Do your best!」</p>
<p>「Yes, exactly what Miss says!  Show me your guts!」</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Yeah!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>  The adventurers responded to Fran’s shout and forcibly shouted. They were already quite exhausted, but they couldn’t break with the encouragement of Fran, who was still a younger generation.  Then the legs of their troops were clearly speeding up.  The effect of Fran’s title had been activated.  </p>
<p>「Isario! The hydrangeas and the old men!」</p>
<p>「Hey, come, but they won’t run away anyway! Don’t worry!」</p>
<p>  The old soldiers of the Kingdom of Hagane stopped around them as if to protect the hydrangea that stood by to watch over us. As Isario said, they probably didn’t care about running away.  </p>
<p>「Rather than that, run!」</p>
<p>「... Nn」</p>
<p>  The adventurers continued to run.  After running for almost 30 seconds, their entire legs were finally dulled. The magicians, who were inferior in terms of physical strength, began to slack off because they continued to run at full speed.  They may have been able to run a little longer, but they were exhausted from the fierce battles.  Even so, the warriors carried the magicians on their backs and did not stop running.  Everyone felt unbearable. An uneasy and sword-thin atmosphere.  </p>
<p>「I’m sorry, miss.」</p>
<p>「Isario, are you okay?」</p>
<p>「I’ll be fine...」</p>
<p>  Fran was carrying Isario on her back.  It was not enough to collapse, but it seemed to be painful because of exhaustion. Isario did not refuse it. It was probably because his pride was not a priority. Fran and the others continued to move desperately, chasing after the presence of the vicious Berserk.  </p>
<p>『It’s coming!』</p>
<p>  Mascot’s fighting spirit suddenly increased. I could feel the fierceness of the moment when the beast attacked its prey.  The antidemon dragonkin, who seemed so sinister, was no longer bothering me.  I could say that he wasn’t right in front of me. That’s just how terrifying the presence of Berserk was.  That’s one of the strongest divine swords that is said to transcend Alpha in terms of combat power. I understood that even though we hadn’t entered into battle yet.  </p>
<p>「Ruooooooooooogh!」</p>
<p>  The roars of the maste-like dragonkin echoed through the air. Just by listening to them, the expressions on the adventurers’ faces stiffened.  The magic circle of Berserk had already escaped, but its presence did not diminish to the point of trembling. Berserk was supposed to be holding in his hand, but he was too dense to see his blade due to the jet-black magic power. And in the next moment, the wall of divine flames burst off and disappeared.  The antidemon dragonkin swung down Berserk, slashing through the flame walls. So easily that it made me wonder if they were weak.  </p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Uroooooogh!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>  The antidemon dragonkin had given up on the preemptive strike, and braced themselves vigilantly. They were probably also instinctively terrified of Berserk.  Instead of immediately attacking them, they spread out to surround us. However, the dragonkin didn’t allow him to wait and rushed towards the antidemon dragonkin themselves.  </p>
<p>「 Die!」</p>
<p> The old beast-like voice of the maste scurry echoed through the battlefield. Berserk, who had been greatly shaken away, emitted a small, black petal-like magical power, enveloping the antidemon dragonkin.  </p>
<p>「Grrr!」</p>
<p>  The antidemon dragonkin began to suffer instantly.  I could feel their bodies rapidly wilting. I guess it was a stronger version of what I had seen before he was liberated.  But I was more curious than Berserk’s abilities.  I’m in a state of mind for the dragonkin.What do you mean?What do you mean? If I let Berserk go, he’ll just keep on rampaging until he dies, right?</p>
