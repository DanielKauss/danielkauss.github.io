</div><h1>Chapter 990</h1><p>After seeing off Militant Nation of Hagane’s retreat, Fran and Amanda moved once again toward the center of the continent. They were wary of the attacks and moved very slowly. However, no antidemons or dragonkin feared them, and they approached the destination with a stunned pace. The survivors of the second unit were stunned to see Trismegistus’ castle. It was getting more and more noisy as we got closer, but they seemed to be speechless right in front of us. They started to get more and more talkative as we got closer, but they didn’t seem to be able to say a word in front of us.  Isario was the only one who was not moving.  </p>
<p>「What is that?」</p>
<p>  Even Fran was in a Pokhan state. There was a hint of admiration and awe in her voice. The scene was so bizarre that Fran would be in fear just by looking at it.  It was a huge castle built as if it was covering a small hill.  Rather than standing on a hill, it was just like having a hill in the castle.  The first wall seemed to surround the hill. It was probably more than a kilometer long and 2 kilometers long. It was huge and majestic, befitting the former royal castle of the Dragonkin, which used to rule over the continent of Gordisia.  The walls were thick and high, with countless spires that seemed to be in vain.  The roof was all blue, and the walls were all white. Is the window coverings and other parts of the castle golden?  The majestic castle had surprisingly maintained its beauty. Trismegistus was the only one who lived in the castle, and it should have been untouched for hundreds of years.  Even so, its walls were free of dirt. Maybe they had some kind of status-preservation magic on them? However, it was not the cleanliness of the castle that surprised Fran and the adventurers.  Almost in the center of the castle, the biggest part of the castle that can be called the main castle. From there, strange things were growing.  From a distance, it looked like a slightly unusual-shaped castle, but in reality, that was not the case. As we got closer, we found out that it was something like a huge tree that grew through the roof of the castle.  The gray rough surface and the branches that grew out of it looked like a tree. However, there were no leaves, and the branches that stretched out toward the sky were also translucent.  And in the end, they had completely disappeared so that they would melt into the sky. So, it would be difficult to confirm them from a distance.  Isario and Frederick were calm because they had known their condition beforehand. In other words, it was not something that happened yesterday or today.  </p>
<p>「That castle was where Trismegistus lived and where the Abyss Eater was created. And the big tree that we saw was the Abyss Eater itself」</p>
<p>「!  That tree?」</p>
<p>「Yeah.  There’s the Abyss Eater’s nucleus in the basement of the castle.  It’s the body that the huge tree thrashed out of it. </p>
<p>「!  That tree?」</p>
<p>「Yeah.  There’s the Abyss Eater’s nucleus in the basement of the castle.  The reason why that huge tree disappeared in the middle is because it’s a half-spirited body」</p>
<p>  As we got closer to the castle, I couldn’t sense any signs of antidemons anymore.  They felt as if they were close to us, or as if they were nowhere to be found. I couldn’t tell exactly where they were even when I searched for them, but I always felt as if they were being watched by antidemons.  I was worried about what was going on, but I guess it was because the presence of the Abyss Eater’s nucleus had covered the surroundings.  </p>
<p>「We can’t detect antidemons in advance if they attack us around here.  Everyone, be more careful than ever. There are also times when antidemons suddenly spring up up close」</p>
<p>「Okay」</p>
<p>  People tend to forget that they spent their time on this continent, but this place where we were now was actually inside the Abyss Eater. Because it was a special being called the Half-Spirit Form, it was difficult to see and sense its presence.  However, it was difficult to touch it, but it was not that there was no interference from the other side.  That was the antidemons. The Abyss Eater created antidemons inside itself and devoured everything.  The source of it was said to be that gray giant tree, the nucleus at the root of it.  If it was near a being that could be called the main body, there would be many antidemons that were created. It was hard to see it close to us now, but we couldn’t let our guard down. However, if there was a nucleus, wouldn’t we be able to defeat the Abyss Eater by destroying it?  Fran thought the same thing.  </p>
<p>「You’re not going to crush a nucleus?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, I won’t crush it. It will withstand even the maximum power of the divine sword and will regenerate itself very quickly」</p>
<p>  To their surprise, the three divine sword users in the past have cooperated to destroy a nuclear weapon directly, and failed.  </p>
<p>「Yeah, I remember Alpha, Klisterus, and Eldrad. I’ve only heard a few things from Trismegistus, so I don’t know much about them.」</p>
<p>「But still, you can’t defeat them?」</p>
<p>「Yeah」</p>
<p>  Ignis, Berserk, and Gaia.  I’ve seen the moment when the power of the divine sword shook me several times in the past. It was frustrating, but all of them had the power that was worthy of being called a Divine Sword.  Can’t three Divine Swords of the same level work together and be destroyed? That was ridiculous.  </p>
<p>「We’re about to get going.  I’m worried that antidemons are nowhere to be found for some reason... Normally, there would be a swarm of antidemons swarming around here.」</p>
<p> Like I thought, they were probably being controlled by someone else.  In the end, the second unit arrived at the foot of the hill where the castle stood, without any fighting or interference.  Once we passed through the huge gate in front of us, it was safe to say that it was already in the area. As soon as we stepped foot into the hill cautiously, I could clearly feel a change in the air.  A gentle breeze for a moment. I felt an out-of-place freshness, as if I was taking a slight breeze through the clear forest.  It seemed that we had passed through a barrier that was kinda like a purification system. Immediately afterward, Fran and some of the adventurers behind Isario stopped in a tight spot.  The adventurers who had not yet crossed the barrier looked strange.  But I know how they feel. I’m in a similar situation.  </p>
<p>「R-Really...  Abyss Eater?」</p>
<p>「Yes, you’ll be fine.  They won’t attack us from the other side around here. But for some reason, antidemons don’t spring up in the castle.」</p>
<p>  The barrier surrounding the hill was probably to push back the influence of the Abyss Eater. A tremendous aura, as if it had been crushed, enveloped us. According to Isario, for some reason, antidemons don’t spring up in the castle.  </p>
<p>「... Actually, I was going to take a break until everyone got used to it. But I can’t just stand by myself when they are greeted」</p>
<p>「Welcome?」</p>
<p>『Fran, it’s the entrance to the castle』</p>
<p>  The Abyss Eater was so strong that her detection abilities couldn’t seem to work.  Fran didn’t notice it either. She was a beautiful blonde dragonkin man.  He stood leisurely in front of the gate of the castle.</p>
<p>『That’s Trismegistus!』</p>
