</div><h1>Chapter 1107</h1><p>「Haha, like the pigs dominating people, that’s just a laugh, right?」</p>
<p>The Chief of the Soldier complained to the country.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that brainwashing education is being conducted in the Raidos Kingdom, but it seems that not all of them are obedient to it.</p>
<p>「Besides, there were some people who had been rampaging in our country lately」</p>
<p>「You’re on a rampage?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. They attacked nobleman’s mansions, took their food, and scattered it around the poor district. To be honest, I’m a little annoyed, but when I talked to them, they were interesting people... I heard they came from the Kingdom of Kranzel」</p>
<p>「What kind of person is she?」</p>
<p>「They said it was a mercenary group made up entirely of half-insect kin. I also heard that they had a strong adventurer old man with them」</p>
<p>「What do you mean?」</p>
<p>(Neidhart and the others?)</p>
<p>『Probably.』</p>
<p>It seems that Neidhart and Dimitris are both doing as they please in the Raydoss Kingdom.</p>
<p>When we asked him for more details, he said what he was doing was reckless.</p>
<p>He said they would attack the greedy nobles and their subordinates, but their methods were quite forceful. They could attack the mansion head-on to knock out all the guards, or attack the troops in the training to steal supplies.</p>
<p>They were also involved in some kind of slave liberation movement, and even took extreme actions to kill nobles to free them.</p>
<p>I guess they were trying to kill registered owners who would not let go of their ownership in order to free their old friends who had been forcibly enslaved.</p>
<p>Neidhart and the others are prepared to betray the Kingdom of Kranzel in order to save their captured comrades in the past. They would not hesitate to use force.</p>
<p>If Fran really wanted to save the black cats enslaved, then she should be able to do that much.</p>
<p>Dimitris, who was giving alms in the poor district――I don’t really know. That old man is going to do whatever he wants on his mind.</p>
<p>However, it seemed that neither Neidhart nor Dimitris took the lives of those who were seriously working for them, and this Chief of Soldier had fought them about twice before.</p>
<p>「Both of them were killed in the blink of an eye. No, since they weren’t killed, did they die in the blink of an eye?」</p>
<p>Neidhart tried to do something about it, but the mantis man had apparently knocked him unconscious and escaped.</p>
<p>Since the old man was at the front of the food grab, it seemed Dimitris was the leader. Maybe they were separating their troops, Dimitris for sanctions against undead nobles, and Neidhart for slave release.</p>
<p>We also tried to get more information about the Southern Duke from the captives, but they didn’t have that much detail. They must have really been treated as abandoned pieces.</p>
<p>Even if I call it a civil war, they only knew about the lives of the people around them. They didn’t even know about the undead that attacked Alessa.</p>
<p>However, in the territories of the Southern Duke these days, undead are used in various scenes, and there are many necromancers. Not many of them can summon more than several thousand undead, but there are still people who can think of two of them.</p>
<p>「One is from a unit that uses an undead known as the Black Skeleton. I’ve heard that the magician named Nameless, the first seat of the unit, is quite skilled.」</p>
<p>It seems that not even in Raydoss’s country, the Black Skeleton Army was known to be a unit made up entirely of undead. It seems that Nameless was also thought to be a person who used necromancy magic.</p>
<p>「And the other one?」</p>
<p>「I haven’t heard of it lately, but it was because the sorceress called Onslaught was very famous. Not only was she a rare necromancer, but her name would naturally spread if she became a skilled one」</p>
<p>「What’s that guy doing now?」</p>
<p>「I don’t know. I’ve been hearing rumors of him being killed by a black rumored adventurer, being hired by a country to do some dirty work, and so on.」</p>
<p>「What’s the black rumor?」</p>
<p>「There were rumors that they were killing people to increase the number of undead under their control, and rumors that they were followers of the Evil Gods. Oh, and later there were even rumors that the monsters were actually wearing human skins」</p>
<p>In other words, he was the kind of person who would be told to do things that were too bad.</p>
<p>『Let’s send these guys to Alessa for now.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Hey, I’m going to bring you to town. If you don’t like the pain, then I won’t against you.」</p>
<p>Fran! Then it’s as if we were the evil ones!</p>
<p>After that, we collected the scouts and bound the earth magicians up with them. We made sure that all the limbs we slashed were properly connected, okay?</p>
<p>We transported them to Alessa at once, on the back of the evolved Urushi. I heard a scream, but Fran ignored them. Just having them talk about their inner feelings doesn’t seem to make them disappear hostile toward Raidos.</p>
<p>Still, their negative feelings towards these soldiers may have faded as they were careful not to fall down.</p>
<p>Along the way, I thought about something.</p>
<p>Where did that undead army surrounding Alessa come from? I highly doubt it was summoned by many necromancers. It was also a challenge to break through the border.</p>
<p>Was that one high-ranking magician doing it by themselves then? That was strange too. Even though it was a horde, it was not powerful enough to drop the town. Or rather, it was a pointless offensive.</p>
<p>I wondered if they had any plan to return the border forces back to Kranzel as much as possible, but I think they were short on what they wanted.</p>
<p>They really didn’t seem to work with the magicians they captured this time, so they really didn’t make any sense to us.</p>
<p>As I was wondering about it like that, Alessa came into view. There was no sign of the undead springing up again, so I wonder if she had regained a little of her composure?</p>
<p>But it was just right after I thought that.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>With a tremendous crash, a pillar of light rose from the center of the nobility district of Alessa. Then, a shockwave that was generated at the same time, blew away the mansions in the area.</p>
