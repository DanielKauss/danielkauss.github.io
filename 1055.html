</div><h1>Chapter 1055</h1><p>An admiral summoning Fran in front, as well as a shivering knight and magician. We’ll have to restrain them first.</p>
<p>The knights would obey if they order them to kneel down, but the admiral needs to take them over first.</p>
<p>But even though it raged wildly, Fran’s anger still hadn’t quelled. Before she could tell her not to resist or be calm, she continued to slash without any conversation.</p>
<p>「「「「Gyaaaaah!」」」」</p>
<p>『Eh? Wha, Fran?』</p>
<p>(First, I’ll figure out the hierarchical relationship.)</p>
<p>He doesn’t seem to want to interrogate Fran for the time being. The three men, who had lost their knees, screamed pitifully on the deck of the water dragonkin. But Fran opened her mouth without moving her eyebrows.</p>
<p>「Are you from the Kingdom of Raidos?」</p>
<p>「Are you sure you want me to cut this?」</p>
<p>「Ghaah! Shit! I couldn’t react to that shit!」</p>
<p>「Why did I look like this!」</p>
<p>I don’t think he was in a state where he could listen to us, but...</p>
<p>But Fran had become merciless.</p>
<p>The three of them were hit with water by magic and lightly intimidated. Then, they opened their mouths again with a cold look on their faces.</p>
<p>「Are you from the Kingdom of Raidos? Answer me.」</p>
<p>「Shut up, shut up, shut up! T-Don’t think you’ll get away with doing something like this! You’re just going to let me go!」</p>
<p>「Hmph.」</p>
<p>「Guh!」</p>
<p>「Gwah!」</p>
<p>「Ghaa! W-Why even us......!」</p>
<p>「Liability.」</p>
<p>The three of them broke their waists and panted because they were hit in the stomach by the wind bullets that Fran released. This could tell that Fran was quietly raging.</p>
<p>「I-I’m just a bodyguard! T-I don’t know much about the country!」</p>
<p>「But just now, the Prime Minister was talking about something」</p>
<p>「Wha! Hear......!」</p>
<p>「The Chancellor is an important person, isn’t she? She is important enough to be able to talk to the Prime Minister in that case, right? You won’t be able to do anything that you don’t know」</p>
<p>「Gyaaaaah!」</p>
<p>「I’ll hurt myself if I tell a lie」</p>
<p>Fran put a kick in the wound of the magician man. The magician man wept and screamed in the intense pain. At this point, the magician’s heart had been completely broken.</p>
<p>The small, fat admiral glared at us with eyes that were still filled with hostility as the magician’s eyes died.</p>
<p>I’m a C-ranked adventurer, but my level has exceeded 30 now. And it’s not a power leveling skill, I’m just the right strength for it.</p>
<p>It seems to be more resistant to pain than magicians. Well, that doesn’t mean I can do anything to Fran though.</p>
<p>Admirals weren’t pure fighters in the first place, so their status was low as well.</p>
<p>「G-Girl!」</p>
<p>Fran approached the admiral, who was about to summon him reluctantly, and immediately stepped on his wound. She trampled through the cross-section of his leg.</p>
<p>The admiral twisted himself and tried to escape, but in front of Fran’s power, there was not much resistance. In fact, he was probably feeling more pain by spreading his wounds on his own.</p>
<p>「――Haaa!」</p>
<p>「Are you from the Kingdom of Raidos?」</p>
<p>The knightman answered that question three times. He must have realized that if he didn’t answer the question no matter what, there was no way he would be saved.</p>
<p>「Yo-you’re right. I’ll answer all your questions! So don’t kill me――Gyaah!」</p>
<p>「Don’t say anything you don’t have to say」</p>
<p>「O-Okay! Now that you understand, take your time!」</p>
<p>「Give me a break?」</p>
<p>「Please thwart me!」</p>
<p>「Hmph.」</p>
<p>Now the knight’s man’s heart must have been completely broken. His eyes were dominated by strong fear. All that was left was for Fran to jerk away at him.</p>
<p>The admiral, who was half-dead, finally became calmer when he saw the knight whimpering in tears. He must have finally understood that the angry girl in front of him held the right to life and death.</p>
<p>What followed was a very smooth conversation.</p>
<p>Like we had heard, this fleet belonged to the Raidos Kingdom, and half of them were the ships and personnel of the Seedrun Sea Kingdom. The Raidos Kingdom, which used its schemes to take Seedrun under its control, seemed to have turned rebellious citizens, soldiers, and royalty into illegal slaves and used them as a disposable force.</p>
<p>The strengthened wards on the water dragonkin were the result of a transformation by an alchemist from the Raidos Kingdom, as well as the skills that Marle possessed.</p>
<p>The damage transfer phenomenon was also due to Marl’s skills. It seemed that admiral-type jobs had skills that affected ships in various ways.</p>
<p>Incidentally, a small, fat admiral was a Stealth Admiral, capable of giving a concealment effect to the fleet under his command. That must have enabled him to get closer to Barbra without being noticed.</p>
<p>It seems that he was still one of the top-ranking navy members of the Western Duke of the Raidos Kingdom. They were also participating in a strategy that caused a civil war and disrupted the Seedrun Sea Kingdom.</p>
<p>And they didn’t know much about Marl’s body, which was the most important thing.</p>
<p>They only know that the magic stone of an indefinitely shaped magic beast called a sea yo and the horn of a mutated demon had been implanted into her body through both a magic stone implantation and a super-humanization technique to synthesize materials from other races and magic beasts.</p>
<p>Human body modification was still an unfinished technique, and those who had been treated would be mentally unstable. However, it seemed that they had been forcibly forced under the control of a slave collar.</p>
<p>It seemed that they were able to control it well until the middle of the battle, but for some reason, the magic stones went out of control, and physical mutations progressed, making the servitude unable to work.</p>
<p>「Hmph.」</p>
<p>「Gwah! W-Why......?」</p>
<p>Admiral pig must have been annoyed to hear about the advanced level of the implantation that he had performed on Marr and the greatness of Raidos. The admiral pig, who was suddenly struck in the face, was surprised, his eyes widened.</p>
<p>「Kinda...」</p>
<p>「......!」</p>
<p>Now we know where Marle was. So why target Barbra?</p>
<p>However, this was just as expected.</p>
<p>Raidos Kingdom invaded the Kranzel Kingdom to settle their long-cherished history, and their strategy was to attack Barbra and build a bridgehead there.</p>
<p>The Kingdom of Kranzel was supposed to have its own navy too, but it was already destroyed in the sea battle near Dards. Well, I guess it couldn’t be helped against the water dragonkin.</p>
<p>Barbra was targeted after that. Although it was a large port, it was far from the Raidos Kingdom, so it had little sense of danger for its foreign enemies. There was still a gap in security due to the commotion since last year. And Barbra’s added value as a supply base by following the Sea Kingdom of Sydran.</p>
<p>That was the reason why we encountered battle ships from the Kingdom of Raidos on our way back from Gordicia.</p>
<p>However, the other party was not fighting against Kranzel, but against the Belios Kingdom. Because of its Commitment to Gordisia, the Kingdom of Belios could not be directly invaded.</p>
<p>Because of this, they had apparently launched a military action targeting a trading port for food importers, which was important to Belios. They must have indirectly tried to cause chaos in Belios.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it seemed that it would also put pressure on Belioth by absorbing its neighboring countries.</p>
<p>And just after the period when it was protected by the Gordician Duty was over, they were planning to attack it at once. The strategy was said to be quite advanced, since the small countries had already taken root in advance.</p>
<p>We got more details about the inner workings of the Sanatorium.</p>
<p>The king of the Raydoss Kingdom had just been changed, and I’ve heard that the dukes of the North, South, East, and West are doing as they please.</p>
<p>It was said that the Eastern and Southern Dukes were leading the way, and the Western Dukes were helping them in this war as well. Each of the Dukes had different goals.</p>
<p>Eastern Duke was from the Kingdom of Belios, Western Duke from the Kingdom of Philias, and Southern Duke from the Kingdom of Kranzel.</p>
<p>Well, it seemed that the fleet we destroyed was under the command of the Western Duke. I guess the Southern Duke was planning to invade the northern border of Kranzel and draw attention to us, and the Western Duke was planning to invade the western part of Kranzel from Barbra in the south west.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the Kingdom of Kranzel were to divide its forces with Barbra, the north would be in short supply, and the Southern Duke would have the advantage. Either way, the Kingdom of Raidos, which took the lead, would have the advantage――.</p>
<p>『We’re lucky to have them here.』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p>If the other party was the Raidos Kingdom, the talented people in the country would all head north. Adventurers don’t have to participate in wars, but things are different if they are dealing with the Raidos Kingdom.</p>
<p>After all, it was a country that hated adventurers so much. If Kranzel were to lose, the lives of the adventurers would change.</p>
<p>Not all of them would go north, but the numbers were dwindling. The few remaining forces could be dealt with by Marl.</p>
<p>With Marl’s fighting ability, he should be able to advance evenly against the B-ranked adventurers. With Raydoss’s help, we might be able to win. If he went out of control, he might be able to compete with the A-ranked adventurers. Well, it was based on the assumption that he was near a lake, such as a sea or river.</p>
<p>The fleet, including the water dragonkin, thoroughly struck Barbra and conquered it all at once with the landing troops, including Marl. That was Raydoss’s strategy, but it seemed that we had appeared before it landed.</p>
<p>Anyway, I could hear most of the things I wanted to hear from him.</p>
<p>『Fran, let’s hand them over in Barbra.』</p>
<p>(......Nn.)</p>
<p>As for Fran, she must have been hurt to some extent that led to her stopping the bleeding, so she performed a normal healing spell.</p>
<p>Because earlier, Fran might have treated her like she had used it to kill her.</p>
<p>I wrapped it all around with magic threads and restrained it. Fran held the tip of the thread, and her legs had not yet regenerated, so it would be impossible to escape.</p>
<p>When I looked around, I saw that most of the ships of the Raidos Kingdom, except for the water dragonkin, had been sunk down. Some of the ships that have not sunk were half-destructed. Some of the ships still have the flag of the Seedrun Sea Kingdom, but their masts and oars have been destroyed and they are uncontrollable.</p>
<p>It might be possible to use a magic tool to move around, but it didn’t seem to have the courage to run away while the giant wolf was watching.</p>
<p>『Urushi, we’re going down to Barbra. Keep an eye on the fleet』</p>
<p>「Can’t you just sink the ship you want to escape from!?」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Fran shouted loudly at the end of the battle. She must have purposely told the rest of the ships about this. Following Urushi’s answer, I felt like I could hear something like a scream.</p>
