</div><h1>Chapter 1109</h1><p>After we passed through the tornado, we saw Klimut lying on the ground. Fran was rushing over to him, but his wind attacks were no longer flying. Maybe it was because he was close to Klimut? </p>
<p>「Klimut! Are you okay?」</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>Klimut moved his blue face lightly and nodded his head. However, he didn’t seem to be speaking. </p>
<p>「Black Lightning Princess!」</p>
<p>「Fran! Klimut-dono won’t turn down if we don’t do something!」</p>
<p> It seemed that Klimut had a deep wound on his stomach. Zenos had put the cloth on his wound to try to stop his bleeding, while Urushi had tilted Klimut’s body to prevent his wounds from turning downward while being wary of the surroundings. Zenos put a cloth on his wound to try to stop his bleeding, and Urushi seemed to be wary of the surroundings and tilted Klimut’s body to prevent his wounds from turning downward.  Klimut himself did not move at all and seemed to be concentrating on something... But wouldn’t Klimut’s spirit be able to heal his wounds? </p>
<p>「I’m going to heal you now」</p>
<p>  Fran used maximam heal. However, Klimut’s wounds did not heal.  </p>
<p>「Eh?」</p>
<p>『Evil Spirit!』</p>
<p>  When I closely observed it, I found that evil spirit seemed to have penetrated into his body as well and it seemed to be interfering with his recovery. Zenos and Urushi looked desperately.  </p>
<p>「Even the Black Lightning Princess won’t be able to do so...!」</p>
<p>「We’re sorry! Even the town of Alessa will be affected by this...!」</p>
<p>「What happened?」</p>
<p>「We don’t know the specifics of it either」</p>
<p>  Zenos then explained it to Klimut.  He said that a sudden intruder had appeared in the lord’s building. Klimut’s spirits and knights went to intercept it, but... </p>
<p>「They had entered the room before I had noticed it too. </p>
<p>「Me too, I didn’t notice it.  It was an undead that was terrifyingly unnoticed.」</p>
<p> It seems that their fighting power itself was lower than that of Urushi, but they were too difficult to conceal their presence to see even in front of them, allowing them to approach.  The undead seemed to have been aiming for Klimut from the beginning and jumped at him without a hitch. Normally, the barrier made by the spirit would have repelled the attack, but the barrier was easily broken, and Klimut seemed to have been hit by a blow from the dagger.  </p>
<p>(Hydman?)</p>
<p>『It looks like everyone except the one we defeated is still hiding...』</p>
<p>  Should we look harder!  If we’re not careful, it’s even possible that the one we defeated was the one who dared to be defeated. So, we let him off guard and the real one was Klimut.  </p>
<p>「What is that undead?」</p>
<p>「Klimut has defeated them. No, it might be more correct to say that he was caught up in the appearance of the Great Spirit and was defeated...」</p>
<p>「Only the remnants of the undead and the dagger are left there」</p>
<p>  They looked at the dagger that emitted magic power from a short distance away.  On the other side of it, only the upper half of the undead body was lying.  </p>
<p>「Klimut-dono, you move to control the Great Spirit that is exposed. Because of this, he can’t escape and is currently staying here.」</p>
<p>「Even Klimut can’t seem to control it completely」</p>
<p>  It seemed that the reason why he wasn’t raging so violently even if it was only to attack those close to him was that Klimut was in control. However, he seemed to be unable to move because he was using his entire body. The reason he didn’t talk was probably not only because of his wounds, but because he has to concentrate on the control of the Great Wind Spirit. </p>
<p>『Fran, let’s heal Klimut with all our might first』</p>
<p>(Okay)</p>
<p>  I don’t know what would happen to the Great Spirit if Klimut continued to lose consciousness. We then applied healing magic to it with the Divine Attribute.  Rather than using multiple blows, I healed him little by little without panicking, with the image of him penetrating deeper.  The experience of healing Fran, who had been wounded by the demonkin, lived here.  The evil spirits and demonkin were different, but the wounds were very similar. The wounds on her stomach, which were completely meaningless by ordinary magic, were slowly starting to close.  </p>
<p>「Ooh!  As expected of the Black Lightning Princess!」</p>
<p>「Fine!  Just a little more!」</p>
<p>  The two men were happy, but they were soon unable to say that.  </p>
<p>「... Muh」</p>
<p>『What’s wrong, Fran?』</p>
<p>(The Great Spirit became even louder)</p>
<p>『What?』</p>
<p> In the next moment, several tornadoes released by the Great Spirit rose to the nobles.  </p>
<p>「... Guh」</p>
<p>「Klimut, are you okay?」</p>
<p>  Klimut nodded with a more painful look than before. It seemed that the wound that was slowly closing up was disrupting Klimut’s concentration.  Pain and itching may be occurring. </p>
<p>「Klimut, do your best」</p>
<p>「... Guh!」</p>
<p>  Klimut nodded clearly while moaning.  His eyes still contain strong power. In the first place, it was amazing that he was still controlling the Great Spirit under these circumstances.  </p>
<p>(Master, hurry)</p>
<p>『Ou!』</p>
<p>  However, if he suddenly increased his recovery speed, Klimut might be surprised. We gradually increased the percentage of Divine Attributes, slowly but surely. Halfway through, Klimut seemed to have grown accustomed to the feeling of his wounds slowly closing up, and the Great Spirit did not run amok beyond our need.  Once fully recovered, he stood up with a somewhat relieved look on his face. His work was not over yet.  </p>
<p>「Fuuh...I had to reseal the Great Spirit that had been released.</p>
