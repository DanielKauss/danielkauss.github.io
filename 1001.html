</div><h1>Chapter 1001</h1><p>Why the Goddess of Beasts and Insects is in such a filthy place! No, it’s inside me though! </p>
<p>「I’m here to give you blessings after I’ve acquired the qualification」</p>
<p>『Qualification?』</p>
<p>「Do you know?」</p>
<p> For some reason, Fran was also questioning the Goddess of Beasts and Insects. </p>
<p>『Huh? Fran, don’t know yet?』</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>「It was an emergency, so I called out to you first」</p>
<p>『Are you an emergency?』</p>
<p>『An emergency?』</p>
<p>「That’s right. Even though it wasn’t my original purpose, I have to stop you if you find someone in front of me who might break the Divine Principle」</p>
<p>『You mean, I’m not here, right?』</p>
<p>「Indeed」</p>
<p> The Beast Bug God nodded seriously and pointed to a piece of the Evil God that frightenedly fell silent.  </p>
<p>「This pitiful being is also a part of the Gods.  It’s fine to use the power that leaked out, but if you use the power of this thing without a contract or permission, it will be used by the Gods. It’s subject to Divine Punishment.」</p>
<p>『S-Seriously!  That’s amazing!』</p>
<p> It seems that it is not a problem to just use the evil energy emitted by the Evil God Fragment, but to draw its power directly from the Evil God Fragment seems to be a bad idea.  No, is it okay to borrow power from the Evil God Fragment without permission? Well, it’s possible that we can’t have a conversation with him though.  </p>
<p>『Th-thanks for stopping me!』</p>
<p>「Yes. It would be too pitiful for a person who is qualified to be punished by the Gods all of a sudden」</p>
<p>『Wh-What is she really qualified for?』</p>
<p>「This girl sensed the power of the Gods by herself and opened the first door.  Therefore, she was qualified to receive my blessings. It’s better to keep going.」</p>
<p> Is that the power of the Gods?  A door?  Is blessing a skill?  I knew it didn’t make sense! But Fran seemed to agree.  </p>
<p>「Nn! Okay, it’s over」</p>
<p>  She was definitely going to respond as usual now!  However, Fran didn’t like to use honorifics. Rather, she seemed to easily recognize and accept the Beast Bug God as a superior being.  She nodded happily in response to her words of encouragement. As I thought, the God who made the Beastmen was special.  </p>
<p>「I’ve done my errands.  Goodbye then」</p>
<p>  The Beast Bug God then disappeared without waiting for our answer. He wasn’t intimidating, but I was nervous just by the presence of the Gods.  </p>
<p>『Fuuh...』</p>
<p>「Fuh...」</p>
<p>  Both Fran and I were at the same time relaxed.  I was thinking about asking for more details, but Fran’s figure faded. I guess the spirit that was brought by the Gods was trying to return to her body.  But before we could do so, Fran opened her mouth.  </p>
<p>「Master.  I’ll do it right away.」</p>
<p>  She didn’t say anything.  If we’re going to do something here, then our only help would be Isario’s.  </p>
<p>『Okay.』</p>
<p> Fran seemed to have gotten something, perhaps thanks to the blessings given by the Beast Bug God, or perhaps because she opened the door.  It’s still too late for us to ask her for more details. As soon as Fran was completely gone, my consciousness emerged and information came in.  Everything stopped and looked like it was coming back.  I didn’t know exactly when, but my time must have been super-accelerating. The scenery must have been the power of the Beast Bug God.  It started moving slowly.  At the same time, I could feel that Fran was about to move forward. Her movements were clearly similar to Georg and Isario’s. I could see that Fran’s first speed was approaching the ones who transcended it because she could see the world slowly.  </p>
<p>『Isario!』</p>
<p>  As I shouted so, the moment time began to move completely.  My vision was quickly filled with a high-speed view, and then my blade slammed into Georg. It was a blow that saw through Georg’s movements.  </p>
<p>「Grrrr!?」</p>
<p>  I exploded with all my strength in sync with Fran’s sharpened blow.  The combined power of Fran and me easily sliced through Georg’s strong barrier and scales. The Dragon King and I exchanged magic power, causing a spark-like burst of magic light.  His right leg was cut off, causing Georg to lose his balance.Georg’s right leg was cut off, causing him to lose his balance.  He was surprised that he did not fall, but he was still slipping on the floor and stopped moving.  However, Isario could not attack Georg.  </p>
<p>「Ooooourgh!」</p>
<p>「Frederick!  Why!」</p>
<p>「Tch!」</p>
<p>  Frederick, who should have been watching over Tilanaria and Zelos Reed, attacked Isario. I couldn’t sense any reason in his expression.  I thought he was quiet, but it seems he was controlling him!  Was this the work of this robe bastard?  Fran quickly kicked Frederick away.  I could see that there was a slight divine attribute in his blow.  The same went for the slash he made earlier. Fran was manipulating the divine attribute, albeit only slightly.  </p>
<p>『Fran, what was that...!?』</p>
<p>  She didn’t use the Sword God Transformation or Divine Beast Transformation, but did she use the divine attribute on her own?  Of course, the Black Lightning God’s Claw wasn’t activated.  It was just a normal kick with a divine attribute on it. Did this mean the door was opened?  No, it wasn’t exactly that now.  I restrained Frederick with telekinesis and land magic.  But in the meantime, Velmeria and Tilanaria broke the restraint and began moving. </p>
<p>「Take care of me!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  We had a disorderly brawl, but Isario and Fran were one step ahead. Fran perfectly positioned Velmeria and Frederick to lure them, and Isario attacked Georg when he was about to get up.  A red-colored divine sword pierced Georg’s chest lightly, and flames poured into his inside at once.  </p>
<p>「Guggaaaaaaaghh!」</p>
<p>  Georg screamed as he whimpered through the sky, but even his voice stopped as if it had been burned down. All that leaked out of his mouth were the bright red tongues of fire that ignited inside the Dragon King.  As flames gushed out of the holes in his body, his body was contracting. He had turned into ash from the insides of his body and collapsed. Then, a few seconds later, there was no ash left, all that was left was black marks that scorched up the floor.</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
