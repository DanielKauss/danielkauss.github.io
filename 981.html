</div><h1>Chapter 981</h1><p>The second unit, which had annihilated the dragonkin, moved further in the center.</p>
<p>While blasting away the antidemons that appeared along the way, our destination was the castle of Trismegistus.</p>
<p>We didn’t know if Velmeria or her mother Tilanaria had really been captured there. However, Frederick seemed to have some certainty about it, and we continued on our way to the center without hesitation.</p>
<p>I had thought the closer we got to the castle of Trismegistus, the more intense the interference from our enemies would be, but the dragonkin were nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Only antidemons attacked us. The Dragon King could possibly manipulate the antidemons, but we didn’t know if this was the result of his ability.</p>
<p>That’s because there are many antidemons in the center of the continent, and that number could even increase with the appearance of the giant-type earlier.</p>
<p>In the end, after the first battle, the second unit had arrived at the castle of Trismegistus without meeting any dragonkin.</p>
<p>But apparently, that was part of their strategy.</p>
<p>「Oi oi, that was a very enthusiastic welcome」</p>
<p>「There’s plenty of dragonkin.」</p>
<p>A little later, we were in the presence of a dragonkin army in the castle of Trismegistus. We already had a glimpse of our destination castle. It would take us less than an hour.</p>
<p>「I wonder what we should do now? I don’t look like a place where people would listen to us......」</p>
<p>「There are 200 of them, and they seem pretty strong. Are we going to go around them?」</p>
<p>「Uwaah, yeah, I’d let you get out of there」</p>
<p>The closer we got, the more smug the atmosphere the opponent exuded. This guy must be our enemy by any stretch of the imagination.</p>
<p>Isario and Fran formed a formation behind the adventurers and soldiers. They must have thought that it might turn into a battle out of the blue.</p>
<p>And that assumption was true.</p>
<p>When the distance between the two reached about 200 meters, the dragonkin started to move. They formed a line and lunged straight at us.</p>
<p>「Tsk!」</p>
<p>Isario stepped forward and unleashed his magic power. He was probably using the provocation skill, but it didn’t affect the entire dragonkin.</p>
<p>There were at most 30 people caught in the lake.</p>
<p>「All of you, readied your weapons! And take the vanguard with your shield!」</p>
<p>At your order, they all readied their weapons.</p>
<p>But the dragonkin’s fighting ability far exceeded our expectations.</p>
<p>「Grrrrr!」</p>
<p>「Lugaaaaaah!」</p>
<p>He seemed to have already lost his rationality from the beginning, but his abilities must have increased instead. Although he was not shown in the appraisal, it seemed that he was in a state close to Potential Release by removing the limiter.</p>
<p>Moreover, I could feel evil energy within him, even though he was not an evil dragonkin. Like I thought, he was probably not in a perfect state.</p>
<p>The old soldiers, who had been fighting evenly with any opponent, were blown away by the first clash. The adventurers’ shields were desperately trying to stop the dragonkin, but they were completely outmatched.</p>
<p>Judging from their equipment, the dragonkin here were probably veteran warriors originally. But because they had been enhanced, their power was much different from the lesser warriors defeated by Isario.</p>
<p>「Urushi! Support everyone!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「I’ll do that one!」</p>
<p>What Fran was staring at was a dragonkin, each emitting a particularly powerful magical power. If he were to rush towards us, there would be tremendous damage.</p>
<p>He looked like a fire dragonkin with his entire body covered in poisonous red scales. His arms were twice as long and thick as normal arms, so it looked as if he had really implanted a dragon’s arm.</p>
<p>He had such a bad balance that I doubt he would be able to move properly. His arms were that big and he was too long.</p>
<p>But they were strong. I could tell that just from their presence.</p>
<p>He was probably using the Sacrament of the Dragon God that Frederick mentioned before.</p>
<p>「......I’m not going any further than this.」</p>
<p>「Are you normal?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, since you’re so loyal to the Dragon King-sama!」</p>
<p>The dragonkin shouted, closing the distance all at once. Is this him their commander? Anyway, the other adventurers must be too heavy for them, so we’ll have to take care of it.</p>
<p>That’s when we heard Frederick’s voice. He advised us while dealing with the dragonkin.</p>
<p>「Black Lightning Princess! This man is Resalva! The elder of the dragonkin in the northern reservations! He’s one of the best dragonkin warriors here! Don’t let your guard down!」</p>
<p>I couldn’t tell the age of the dragonkin at a glance since they even had scales on their faces, but they seemed to be an elder. Dragonkin were a long-living race, so it was no exaggeration to say that the older they were, the stronger they were.</p>
<p>But if it has been strengthened, it is probably quite powerful.</p>
<p>「Tell me what you know! If you’re a dragonkin, you mustn’t get defeated before your king!」</p>
<p>「Who would ever fall for a self-proclaimed king!?」</p>
<p>「Yeah! Next to the girl, I’ll slice you into eight pieces!」</p>
<p>I thought this guy was uncontrolled, but the boil point was still the same. It seemed to be under the influence of mental manipulation, as long as he hadn’t lost his rationality.</p>
<p>Well, that doesn’t mean we’ll go easy on them though. I mean, we can’t go easy on them.</p>
<p>「You’re done here, so I can’t cut Frederick into eight pieces.」</p>
<p>「You little girl! Let’s kill her!」</p>
<p>「You shouldn’t talk nonsense. You’re gonna be a liar.」</p>
<p>「Nugaa!」</p>
<p>Fran decided to imitate Isario and provoke her. After all, angry opponents are more likely to fight because their movements are monotonous.</p>
<p>However, even if he was monotonous, his movements were unusually fast.</p>
<p>「Shaaaa!」</p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>Even though she knew that she would be able to cut, Fran couldn’t avoid it and took it with me. There was no sign of attack.</p>
<p>『Fran! This guy emitted flames from his back and accelerated rapidly!』</p>
<p>It was the same reaction that Colbert had shown in the martial arts tournament. She accelerated not with her own muscle strength, but with the momentum of releasing flames from her weakness.</p>
<p>This removed Fran’s timing and forced her to take the thrust. Moreover, the power of the blow was tremendous.</p>
<p>That greatly reduced my durability value.</p>
<p>『It’s not just his strength. That’s his sword, the magic sword.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>It didn’t have any special abilities, but it had attack power of over 80 and conductivity of A, so it could be called a high-ranking magic sword.</p>
<p>「I’ll shred them all!」</p>
<p>「That’s my line!」</p>
