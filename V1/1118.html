</div><h1>Chapter 1118</h1><p>After revealing me to Klimut, it seemed that she felt a little easier on her. Fran looked cheerful and was busy hunting. I guess she’s been wondering about this for a long time now.</p>
<p>And the day after she provided more meat to Alessa, Fran met with the supplies transport unit that she was planning to lead.</p>
<p>There were a lot of fully equipped adventurers and mercenary-looking men in Alessa’s square. Some of them looked pretty strong, so I’m sure there were more than 50 people in total.</p>
<p>I had imagined more civilians since they told me I was a valiant soldier, but... many of them seemed to have fighting prowess, such as active adventurers and mercenaries who had a grudge against Raidos.</p>
<p>「At any rate, we need to take her to a place where she can rest. What do you think?」</p>
<p>As I observed them chatting in a vulgar atmosphere, I saw a pair of men and women approaching us.</p>
<p>The man was a short warrior carrying a spear that emitted strong magical power.</p>
<p>Apparently, he was human. His face was hidden due to the metal hat, but he had no claws, horns, tail, and ears. He was about 160 cm tall, which was quite small.</p>
<p>He was skinny and at first glance looked like a caster, but the armor he wore belonged to the vanguard. He had a spear longer than his height, and leather armor reinforced with vital points. In addition, he was wearing a mask-type head equipment with three horizontal slits around his eyes.</p>
<p>However, it was shaped gracefully and had many curves as a whole, and had no martial arts capabilities at all. I could tell that it was a man by the way he muscled, but I couldn’t imagine how powerful it was.</p>
<p>There was no atmosphere that could be described as strong, but it had a strange presence. It was just my intuition, but it seemed to be quite strong.</p>
<p>Female――or should I say, the girl was human too? Her long, beautiful blonde hair looked like that of an elf, but her ears were round. She couldn’t even see her face because she was wearing a mask either.</p>
<p>He was about 160 cm tall, and had thin limbs. I guess he was not an adult.</p>
<p>With a white robe and a wooden wand, this girl seemed like a caster. I wonder what she was capable of? She seemed to be able to use martial arts quite well.</p>
<p>The fact that they had similar masks suggested that they were definitely their friends. The contrast between a dark-skinned man and a white-skinned girl was a strange picture.</p>
<p>「Oya~i, Oya~i, Oya~i」</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>「Black Lightning Princess, Fran-dono, right?」</p>
<p>They approached us in a straight line and casually called out to us. Well, all they were talking about was men, while the girl just refrained from doing so quietly.</p>
<p>「I will be your guide this time.」</p>
<p>「High-ranking adventurer with an eccentric personality?」</p>
<p>『Wha, Fran-san? Nel-san said something like that, but don’t tell him directly!』</p>
<p>Then Fran shook her head, as if she had noticed something.</p>
<p>「I was a little different. She didn’t say anything strange」</p>
<p>Yeah, you’re right. You can still fool them now!</p>
<p>「A lot of things happened, but he said she wasn’t a bad person」</p>
<p>『I haven’t changed!』</p>
<p>But the man was smiling. Not a wry smile, but a real joy.</p>
<p>「Hahaha, this is harsh. But it’s said to be one of the better Rank A adventurers.」</p>
<p>「Rank A?」</p>
<p>Seriously? If so, it was hiding its abilities quite well. Moreover, it was aware that it was a little strange? Certainly, it might be better than a Rank A.</p>
<p>「Yes, they don’t belong to this country, but they do call themselves Marefiscent. They do a lot of weird things to them, like 『Black cats』, 『Cannibalists』, and even 『Onlookers』.」</p>
<p>A black child maleficent! This is the adventurer who had the skill eraser that Ashwrath mentioned before, used to destroy an opponent’s skill!</p>
<p>「You’re a Marfiscent, the acquaintance of Ashwrath?」</p>
<p>「Well, you’re right, she was that person after all. I guess what she was saying was just my blunders, right? Whether it’s annoying, sticky, or dark」</p>
<p>「...? I didn’t say it.」</p>
<p>「Really? That person has been rolled up, huh? Well, that’s fine. Well, please take good care of us on the way, Black Lightning Princess-dono」</p>
<p>「Nn. Nice to meet you」</p>
<p>Somehow, he sounded a bit disgusting. He had a super-low attitude towards A-ranked adventurers, and I didn’t feel any malice coming from him, but his attitude was so light that I was confused.</p>
<p>Fran’s gaze turned to the girl behind Marelliscent. Then Marelliscent introduced us to the girl.</p>
<p>「As you can see, she’s quiet, so I’ll introduce her to you. She’s a persona, and she’s my partner.」</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>「Even though he looks like this, he’s a B-ranked adventurer with the aliases of “appraisal killer” and “whiteboard”.」</p>
<p>She seemed really docile, and the girl bowed her head quietly without saying anything. I couldn’t feel any hostility either from here, but I couldn’t understand her expression because of her face hiding in the mask.</p>
<p>「An Appraisal Slayer?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. She had Extra Skills, so around her, my appraisal skills would automatically be blocked. The name “Shitty” was derived from the fact that no magic tools for appraisal could be detected.」</p>
<p>It would be quite convenient for our comrades to be effective too. It would mean that we didn’t have to leak any of our strength at all.</p>
<p>Well, it seems to be activated automatically, so it’s not just an advantage. I tried appraising it myself, but it just showed me that it was not possible to appraise it. It’s an Extra Skill, so I guess it’s pretty powerful.</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>Fran and Persona stared at each other in silence. Then, Fran bowed her head as if to say hello to the other. I wonder why did they communicate with each other in silence?</p>
<p>「Hee~! It’s rare to see a persona so relaxed like this!」</p>
<p>「......I don’t know at all.」</p>
<p>That’s all we could trust, so we can’t let our guards down for now.</p>
