</div><h1>Chapter 1001</h1><p>The Goddess of Beasts and Insects is......! Why is it, in such an evil and dirty place! No, it’s inside of me!?</p>
<p>「I’m here to give you the blessing of this qualified girl」</p>
<p>『Qualification?』</p>
<p>「What do you mean?」</p>
<p>For some reason, Fran also questioned the Beast Bug God.</p>
<p>『Huh? Fran still doesn’t know?』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「I called out to you first because it was an emergency.」</p>
<p>『Is it an emergency?』</p>
<p>「That’s right. Even if it wasn’t my original purpose, I can’t help but stop it if I find someone in front of me who might violate the Divine Principle」</p>
<p>『That’s me, right?』</p>
<p>「Yeah」</p>
<p>The Beast and Insect God nodded heavily and pointed to a piece of the Evil God that had remained silent in fear.</p>
<p>「This pitiful being is also a part of the Gods. It won’t be a problem for us to use the power leaking out, but if we use the power of this thing without a contract or permission, it will be the use of the Gods. They are subject to Divine Punishment」</p>
<p>『F-for real! That’s nothing!』</p>
<p>It would be fine as long as we only used the Evil Spirit emitted by the Evil God Fragment, but it would be bad for us to draw power from the Evil God Fragment directly.</p>
<p>「......Okay, but I don’t have much strength left. I think I can only play one more time.」</p>
<p>『T-Thank you for stopping!』</p>
<p>「Indeed. It would be too pitiful for a qualified person to be suddenly punished by the gods」</p>
<p>『What kind of person is she?』</p>
<p>「This girl felt the power of the Gods in her own power and opened the first door. Therefore, she has been qualified to receive my blessings. Please continue to work hard」</p>
<p>A door? Is blessing a blessing? I really don’t get what it means! But Fran seemed to agree with that.</p>
<p>「Nn! Okay, I’m on it」</p>
<p>She was trying to respond to the Beast Bug God as usual now! However, Fran didn’t like to use honorifics. In fact, she easily recognized the Beast Bug God as a superior being and accepted him.</p>
<p>She nodded happily at his words of encouragement. Like I thought, the Goddess who made the beastmen must be special.</p>
<p>「I’ve done my business, so I’ll say goodbye」</p>
<p>The Beast and Insect God told me that much, and then I disappeared without waiting for my answer. It wasn’t that they were intimidating me, but I was nervous just by the presence of the Gods.</p>
<p>『Phew.........』</p>
<p>「Fuh...」</p>
<p>Both Fran and I were slacking our shoulders at the same time. I thought about asking her for more details, but Fran’s figure faded. I guess the spirit that the Gods had brought over was trying to return to our bodies.</p>
<p>But first, Fran opened her mouth.</p>
<p>「Master. I’ll do it right away.」</p>
<p>I’m not going to say anything in return. The only thing we could do here would be Isario’s support.</p>
<p>『Okay』</p>
<p>Maybe it was thanks to the blessing given to her by the Beast and Insect Gods, or perhaps because she opened a door and stuff, Fran seemed to have grasped something.</p>
<p>It would be too late to get the details.</p>
<p>As soon as Fran completely disappeared, my consciousness was lifted and information from the outside came in.</p>
<p>Everything stopped and I saw it. I don’t know when it all started, but my time must have been super-accelerated. It must have been the power of the Beast Bug God.</p>
<p>The scenery began to move slowly. At the same time, I could see that Fran was trying to step forward. Her movements were clearly similar to those of Georg and Isario.</p>
<p>It was because I could see the world so slowly that I could tell that Fran’s initial speed was approaching the transcendents.</p>
<p>『Isario!』</p>
<p>The moment I shouted, time started to move completely. My field of view was then filled with high-speed vision, and my blade had been slammed into Georg. It was a blow that completely saw through Georg’s movement.</p>
<p>「Grrrr!?」</p>
<p>With Fran’s sharpened blow, I exploded with all my power. With the help of me and Fran, this slash easily sliced through Georg’s solid barriers and scales. The magic of us and the Dragon King collided, blowing away a spark of magic light.</p>
<p>Georg, whose right leg had been cut off, was losing his balance. He was surprised that he did not fall down, but he stopped moving, slipping limply on the floor.</p>
<p>But Isario could not attack Georg.</p>
<p>「Wooo~f!」</p>
<p>「Frederick! Why!」</p>
<p>「Tsk!」</p>
<p>Frederick, who should have been watching over Tilanaria and Sierra, attacked Isario. I couldn’t sense any reason in his expression.</p>
<p>I thought it was quiet, but it seems they were actually controlling it! Was this the work of this robe bastard?</p>
<p>Fran quickly kicked Frederick away. I could see a slight hint of Divine Attributes in his blow. The same went for the slash she made earlier. It was only a little, but Fran was manipulating the Divine Attributes.</p>
<p>『Fran, for now...!』</p>
<p>「Nn. But I can’t borrow the power of the Evil God’s Claw」</p>
<p>No, not now. I bind Frederick with telekinesis and land magic. But in the meantime, Velmeria and Tilanaria released their restraints and began to move.</p>
<p>「Hey, girl! I’ll be counting on you!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Isario and Fran were one step ahead of them in a disorderly brawl. Fran perfectly positioned herself to draw Velmeria and Frederick’s attention, while Isario attacked Georg on the verge of rising up.</p>
<p>The reddish-looking Divine Sword pierced Georg’s chest lightly, and flames poured into his chest.</p>
<p>「Ghughaaaaaah!」</p>
<p>Georg screamed as he scratched the sky, but the sound stopped as if even his voice had been burned down. All that leaked out of his mouth was the bright red tongue of flames that burned inside the Dragon King.</p>
<p>Flames were billowing out of the hole in her body, and her body shrunken. She had collapsed, turning into ashes from the inside.</p>
<p>A few seconds later.</p>
<p>There was not even ashes left, only black marks that burned the floor.</p>
<p>『I knew it was impossible to catch him without killing him......』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
