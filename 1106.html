</div><h1>Chapter 1106</h1><p>The conversation was over in no time. The soldier, who was not being trained, immediately let out a sound.</p>
<p>They were enemy troops, but they were troops with many earth magicians and had dug a passageway under the ground to pass through the border. If that had happened, there was a possibility that they would not have noticed it for sure.</p>
<p>After that, they were planning to attack their enemy, the town of Kranzel. However, they had left the scene unexpectedly and were in the middle of looking for the town of Alessa.</p>
<p>There were now 22 people, seven earth magicians and fifteen guards. However, I heard that four people, including this man, were out for scouting, so I’m guessing there were now only 11 guards.</p>
<p>I don’t know what they’re capable of, so it’s pretty scary to launch an attack out of the blue. No one was supposed to be that bright of a scout when it came to using a soldier of this level as a scout.</p>
<p>『First, let’s get the other three people who are scouting out.』</p>
<p>「Okay」</p>
<p>We soon discovered the scout. Judging from Urushi’s nose and Fran’s senses, it was easy. All four of them were probably not specialized scouts, but just magicians and their guards.</p>
<p>The scout soldiers who had taken their consciousness off were left behind in this state. It would be troublesome to take them with us. Well, if the magic beasts couldn’t do it, we’ll come to retrieve them later.</p>
<p>We headed to the place we had heard from the four, and as the information said, the magic corps of the Kingdom of Raidos was holding its breath in the forest.</p>
<p>They didn’t even seem to notice us when we approached them in secret. This would have been impossible without someone with scouting skills.</p>
<p>『The strongest one is that Earth Magic-user, huh?』</p>
<p>(Nn. And the soldier beside it.)</p>
<p>『I guess that’s the commander.』</p>
<p>All of the magicians had high levels. They seemed to have some combat experience. Soldiers, on the other hand, were not very strong. They were not weak, but they were probably about Rank E for adventurers.</p>
<p>The soldiers who seemed to be the captain were also decently strong, but they were not Fran’s enemies. I wonder if it was better to disable the magician first and then capture the soldiers?</p>
<p>They don’t want to chase after him when he escapes, so they should block their escape route first.</p>
<p>『Let’s cover the surroundings with land magic and take them down at once, just like when we defeated Hydeman. I’ll scatter my thunder magic from time to time, so Fran take out this sorcer and soldier-type guy from time』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p>『Urushi, aim at being a magician too. It’s just that if there’s anyone who escapes somehow, we’ll take care of them』</p>
<p>(Woof!)</p>
<p>After we concealed our presence and approached him, we activated Great Wall multiple times to encircle the hiding troops of Raidos.</p>
<p>A roar and smoke billowed out from the earth, encircling all sides of the troops.</p>
<p>Fran was already on the wall of earth.</p>
<p>「W-What’s wrong...? Let’s just open an escape route for now!」</p>
<p>「「「「Yes!」」」」</p>
<p>Oioi, aren’t their movements pretty good? I thought they would panic more, but the magicians immediately started moving toward the wall. The soldiers were in sync with their movements.</p>
<p>Before anyone could check what had happened, she decided to escape first. Even in the darkness of the night, she only knew that a wall appeared suddenly. Did she sense any magic coming from the earth magic system?</p>
<p>With seven earth magicians and earth magicians here, I can pierce the walls in no time at all.</p>
<p>We decided to hurry up and start moving before we could escape.</p>
<p>Fran and Urushi had not been found yet. While I was blasting away my thunderbolt magic, Fran jumped off the wall and slashed at our enemies.</p>
<p>「Gah!」</p>
<p>「Wha――! Gyaaah!」</p>
<p>Amid the chaos caused by the thunderbolts and roars in the darkness, Fran unexpectedly defeated two enemy commanders. She hadn’t taken their lives, but her arms and legs were severed off.</p>
<p>The rest of them were either paralyzed by lightning magic or restrained by Urushi’s dark magic. So, no one should be dead.</p>
<p>『All right, let’s get the info from the commander. We’ll take them out of the ring and separate them from the others. Urushi, we’ll keep an eye on them』</p>
<p>「Urushi, if you want to escape, you can kill him」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>I could see the magicians trembling at Fran’s threatening words. They must have been pretty trained, but Urushi at night was so powerful. Moreover, I was now using the fear skill.</p>
<p>This is a skill that increases the fear you place on yourself, but you don’t use it often. If you’re an opponent who is scared of Urushi in the fight, you can win without even using the skill, and it doesn’t have much effect beyond the same rank.</p>
<p>Well, this method of frightening others can be very useful at a time like this. In fact, it worked even when we were talking to a scout.</p>
<p>We followed up the interrogation of the earth magicians――but surprisingly, he gave us the information we were after.</p>
<p>He doesn’t seem to be very good at negotiating. He probably thought that in order to save the lives of himself and his subordinates, we would have to tell them what we wanted without lying.</p>
<p>In the first place, this attempt itself was not in the cards.</p>
<p>They were not originally under the command of the Southern Duke, who led the invasion this time. They were apparently members of a unit that protected towns and other places from magic beasts and belonged to a place like the support organization of the Red Knight Order.</p>
<p>This is probably why he is not used to negotiating and fighting against human opponents.</p>
<p>That’s why they had the authority to forcibly build them under their control and treat them as disposables. That’s why they wouldn’t be motivated.</p>
<p>Their main goal was the destruction of the city gates and walls in Alessa. Therefore, many earth magicians and earth magicians came here to destroy the city walls. Even if they couldn’t break the walls directly, they still had to create holes under the ground to cave in and break down the walls.</p>
<p>It seemed that their purpose was to provoke the adventurers guarding the border to get flustered and have some of their troops return to Alessa if necessary.</p>
<p>Seriously, she was being treated as a cannonball.</p>
<p>「I’ve been taught since I was little that the Kingdom of Kranzel was a terrible country and that what the Kingdom of Raidos could control was justice.」</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>「But living here tells me much about how rotting my country is. Especially for people like me who have a lot of contact with the authorities. Do things that they control benefit Kranzel? Haha, like pigs controlling people, that’s funny, isn’t it?」</p>
<p>The commander muttered one last time as he laughed in a self-mocking manner.</p>
