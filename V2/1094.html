</div><h1>Chapter 1094</h1><p>This time, Fran had planned to go to Alessa――but she had accepted a new request at the lockers. The request was to escort Duke and Satia, so she could not refuse it. Knights and soldiers had gathered at the lockers, but they had no strength in mind. That’s when Fran, the B-ranker with an alias, stood up with a white arrow. Normally, she would not have been able to rely on an adventurer to escort the princess, but the guildmaster was the lord’s substitute, and Kranzel was a high-ranking adventurer. In particular, those with an alias are more trustworthy than knights who are bad at it. In particular, the alias bearers are said to be more trustworthy than knights who are not very good at knights. They have Urushi’s transportation power, and Satia and Fran know each other, so they probably don’t have more suitable people than Fran.Urushi’s transportation power was good, and I guess Satia knew nothing better than Fran.  The fact that Alessa’s war situation was even stronger than before was one of the reasons why Fran had accepted this request.  It seems that the Raidos army deployed in the north had gotten information that the surprise attack had failed and was at waist height. They had originally planned to strike the Kranzel Kingdom, but both their naval and surprise forces had been destroyed.  They had caused damage to Barbra and Dars, but that alone was meaningless for the northern war. They might be wondering if they should attack or retreat on their own.  Some of the Kranzel forces that have already gathered in Alessa are going to infiltrate Raidos. Even so, Raidos side was only going to repeat the wait-and-see approach, and small-scale clashes were sporadically taking place near the border. With this, Fran wouldn’t have to hurry to Alessa.  In fact, taking Derick and Satia to the royal capital might help corner Raidos.  From a wider perspective, that would be a measure to cover for Alessa. Well, this was what I taught Fran.  </p>
<p>「Fran-san, please take care of them」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>  The lower-ranking demon behind Satia was carrying a delinquent that was framed in a goosebumper with restraints.  The chain that was wrapped all over her body was a magic tool. It was an item used to deprive her of her power and prevent her from escaping.  In addition, she had blindfolds and gagged legs.  Moreover, her arms and legs were still lost. It seemed that she kept this information on purpose to negotiate with her to speak in exchange for healing.  Against the background of such a terrible looking delinquent, there were two girls who could talk to each other in a friendly manner.  Don’t you mind it?  Both of them were amazing. Even though adventurers and soldiers who saw them off were quite annoyed.  </p>
<p>「Urushi, welcome!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  We departed with a lot of people watching over us, but the journey to the royal capital was really pleasant. We were wary of any attacks, but it seems that we failed to do anything about Urushi as he flew through the sky.  In fact, it might be more dangerous for us to wait until we arrived at the royal capital.  We would prepare ourselves a little farther away from the royal capital. The Royal Capital would be in chaos if the huge remaining Urushi appeared.  However, since Urushi was just smaller, there was no problem. Fran jumped in the air, Satia was carried by Ronowe, and Derick was carried by demons.  We continued on, and several knights were waiting in front of the gate to the royal capital.  We shouldn’t know the exact arrival time though...  Maybe they had been waiting ever since they mentioned they were going to transfer Derick and Satia. I’m glad they didn’t take any detours along the way. </p>
<p>「Satia-sama, right?」</p>
<p>「Yes, please take care of them」</p>
<p>「Haah!  And Fran-dono, their escort, and that man...」</p>
<p>「Nn.  The operatives of the Raidos Kingdom」</p>
<p>  The knights’ stern gazes fell on Dirk. I guess the fact that he was in a war made him feel quite bad about the Raydoss people.  </p>
<p>「This man, come with me」</p>
<p>「Understood」</p>
<p>  Dirk was placed in a huge metal crate that the knights brought with him. It was a large crate of two meters square.  It was made of magical metal, and I could see that it was increasing its strength with magic. Moreover, it seemed that some weight reduction techniques were applied, and the knights were carrying it leisurely.  It was said to be used when they don’t want to let their opponent escape more than in an iron cage. In a world where there are magic and skills, there is a danger of escaping if they don’t do this much.  After that, about ten knights transported Derick, and Fran was put on a carriage with Satia. That way, the royalty wouldn’t be able to walk around.  Our destination was, of course, the royal castle.  I thought we should act as Satia’s escort, but Fran was also a valuable witness. So, it was not a bonus for us.  They were led to a place that looked like the reception room of the royal castle together with Fran and were treated with a reception. After Fran had filled her stomach with a lot of tea and snacks, someone important finally came to us.  Or rather, an important person.  There was Count Bailleys.  He was Velmeria’s father, as well as the leader of the knights that protected the royal capital. He was supposed to have been responsible for the girl’s rampage in the royal capital and had been punished in some way...  Apparently, she still holds a high position in the knights. Or did she come back in a short period of time?  </p>
<p>「My name is Sidre Bailleys, and I am a member of the Knights of the Guards. Even though she was no longer the leader of the knights, she was still very important to them.  They knew Fran well and it was easy for us to do business here. The Kranzel Kingdom must have understood this and assigned Count Bailleys to this role. In fact, the conversation went very smoothly from there. Satia’s mouth told her what Filurias was trying to do, and Fran then told her the current situation and the information she had obtained from Dirk. </p>
<p>「Satia-dono, your country is not going to seek any compensation or apology from the Kingdom of Philias for this」</p>
<p>「But we are!」</p>
<p>「We don’t have any evidence that you have tried to go, and we don’t want to make any friends with the Kingdom of Philias at this time of the year. In fact, I rather want to strengthen our friendly relations with them」</p>
<p>  In other words, I’m going to make sure everything is fine, so we should get along with the Kingdom of Philias. For the current Kranzel Kingdom, that would be the most grateful. If we lose our allies and get some money or supplies, we won’t necessarily gain an advantage over the Kingdom of Raidos.  Satia might have wanted us to punish her, but that was a choice that no one would gain. I heard along the way that both Satia and Fran are mentally assimilated by making a deep contract with the demon.  Therefore, it is said that Filurias’s royalty grow mentally faster than Fran. Well, it was obvious compared to Fran.  Even so, it was not as if they had grown up completely, nor would their knowledge suddenly increase.  Therefore, it felt a little awkward. It felt like there was both adulthood and childishness at the same time.  </p>
<p>「I’ve been avoiding a clear military alliance with the Kingdom of Philias up until now.  But this time I would like to further strengthen our ties with each other」</p>
<p>「... Understood. I will do whatever I can to help.」</p>
<p> It seems that our two countries were in a shallow cooperation to avoid seeming to irritate Raydoss.  They decided to take that opportunity to sandwich Satia in between and bring it to an ally.</p>
