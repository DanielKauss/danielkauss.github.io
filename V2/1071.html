</div><h1>Chapter 1071</h1><p>After I judged that I couldn’t defeat the demons leisurely, I transformed my decorative string and stretched it out toward Franto. I captured her main body and shut her up! Urushi was on his way to Satia. </p>
<p>(Master!)</p>
<p>『I won’t kill her!』</p>
<p>(...I’m sorry.)</p>
<p> Fran must be frustrated at the fact that she couldn’t finish it off. But I was even happy. It was a natural feeling for a person to not want to cut or fight because she was friends. It was a natural feeling for a person to not want to cut down or fight someone because they were friends.  Just looking at them in terms of fighting, I might be able to say that they were weaker, but I definitely think they were growing. Besides, she was her partner at a time like this.  </p>
<p>『I’ll do what Fran can’t. On the other hand, if I can’t, Fran, you help me』</p>
<p>(Nn.  Okay)</p>
<p>  Fran nodded and slashed at her.  I guess she’s planning to block the movements of the demons and support me. </p>
<p>「Guys, get as far away from here as possible!」</p>
<p>  Hearing Fran’s words, the villagers began to leave the scene on their own.  However, the square was surrounded by wooden barriers and the men were restrained. They couldn’t go too far, but just a short distance away would make it easier for them to fight.  The Sword God Transformation had already been broken, and I didn’t use Divine Energy Manipulation or Evil Conquest.  However, Fran was overwhelmed by it.  She evaded the scythes, cut through invisible telekinesis, and cut through the huge demon’s body.  It was regenerated quickly because the regeneration inhibition didn’t work, but she was still unable to move during her regeneration. It was as if she was giving her subordinates instructions. And without the support of the demons, my steel threads rushed to Fran.  </p>
<p>「Kuh!  Shit!」</p>
<p>  I tried to run away, but Fran’s own stats were not that great. Her level was higher than before, but she was probably just a low-ranked adventurer.  Her abilities were also biased towards skills for manipulating demons.  My steel threads tangled around Fran’s limbs to seal her movements.  But Fran did not allow him to do so. She used the blessings of the Beast and Insect God to unleash attacks, sometimes clad in Divine Attributes.  As I thought, the divine attribute would work against the demons as well.  Unregenerating wounds remained on her wounds, preventing her from showing any signs of weakness.  As a result, she was unable to avoid being regenerated. The moment she turned her back, she might be hit with a non-regenerating blow in her vital spots. </p>
<p>『Sleep!』</p>
<p>「Guggaaah!」</p>
<p>  I aimed to paralyze Fran to block her movements, but Fran was not paralyzed.  Upon closer inspection, I saw that black magic power was flooding Fran’s body. It seemed that she had her own demon, just like a demon knight.  Besides her bune, she seemed to have obeyed other demons as well.  The demons had a high level of magical defense and resistance to status anomalies.  By gaining that power, they must be able to block my thunder magic.  Will I increase the power output? But if I overdo it, they might kill me.  Urushi seemed to feel the same way, and they were having a hard time restraining me.  My black magic had been canceled.  However, I also had sealed away Ronowe.  What a poison mist.  The combined use of Poison Nullification and Predation Absorption Skills must have enabled him to devour my poisoned Ronowe.  As a result, I could see him attacking with tentacles instead of being able to poison atomize him unnecessarily. However, if it was a physical battle, Urushi would have the advantage.  Then I think I could concentrate on it.  </p>
<p>『How about this!』</p>
<p>  I used my Magic Steal and Magic Absorption skills as much as I could. With this, I sucked out the magic power of the demons and defeated them.  I could see that Fran’s magic power was decreasing rapidly.  Not only was it sucked by me, but she was also putting a lot of power into her defense against electric shocks.  If things continue like this, the magic exhaustion might be able to knock Fran out.  But Fran could not do anything for herself. She must have realized that she could be captured without doing anything.  </p>
<p>「I will give you my magic power......!  Possess it!  Bruneee! Gughaaaaaahhh!」</p>
<p>『This is......!』</p>
<p>「Uuoooh!」</p>
<p>  Just as Fran’s figure disappeared, Fran’s appearance changed drastically.  Her skin turned brown, and her hair went pale as if she had lost its color. Her eyes had turned gold, and mysterious red patterns had appeared on her arms and face.  Fran’s figure sank into the shadows, appearing a short distance from her. She had used shadow transfer.  </p>
<p>「Haah, haah...  Fran, don’t lose!  But I won’t lose!  Yes! The speed was unbelievably fast than before with Fran.  With that momentum, she slammed the handle of the scythe on her right hand.  It was probably the same as the jet-black scythe wielder that Fran had. It was very small because it was the size of Fran, but its power was stronger now. It seemed to be stronger in her possession of Fran than in her summoned state.  </p>
<p>「Uoooooooh!」</p>
<p>「Mwah!」</p>
<p>『And the power of my telekinesis is rising!  But it’s not enough to block it. Leave it to me!』</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
<p>「That’s crazy......」</p>
<p>  Fran was surprised, probably thinking that she could win as long as she had the bune in her possession.  But that was a bit naive. Fran when we first met, may have certainly lost.  But it’s not enough for us now that we’ve seen the hell in Gordicia! Fran still didn’t have a scratch on her body. I tried to shatter her limbs and neutralize it, but something was going on behind that. </p>
<p>「Kyain!」</p>
<p>  Urushi was flicked away by countless tentacles and flew through the air.  Satia was fused with Ronoue.  First, she was summoned, and second, possessed. Then the first demon knight and the current Satia’s status were ‘Formation’.  </p>
<p>「Ahahahaha!  The one who disobeys me! Shall we make it stuffed like this!?」</p>
<p>「Grrrr...」</p>
<p>It wasn’t Satia, Ronowe’s words were emanating from her mouth.</p>
