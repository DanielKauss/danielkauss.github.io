</div><h1>Chapter 930</h1><p>Ten days have already passed since Fran and the others fended off the antidemon horde. The antidemons had been completely repelled, and the town was able to escape the danger. Not only the east side, which Fran and the others had protected, but the other gate was firmly defended. The outlaws seemed to have done their best. They heard Sophie explaining the situation to Quina next to her, so they knew most of the situation. At first, they were all wary of Quina’s sudden appearance, but some of them had watched their exchange with Zefmate, so they were soon accepted by Sophie and the others. At first, they were all wary of Quina’s sudden appearance, but Sophie and Sophie quickly accepted her.  They must have been the reason why they fought off fire thieves and antidemons as Mea’s escort. In no time at all, she had become a little famous as the </p>
<p>『Very Strong Maid-san』</p>
<p>. In addition to Quina, Frederick, who was working with Sophie to cover the Sanatorium, was there no problem escorting Fran and Sophie.  They were now transferred to the tower, and Sophie was taking care of them by someone she could trust.  Nelsh, who was Sophie’s bodyguard, had chosen some of them, so there was no way he could actually―― Nelsh, along with Frederick, was fighting alongside the soldiers. However, he was caught up in the barrage and lost consciousness, and only woke up after the battle ended. He seemed to be very frustrated about that, and took the lead in handling the aftermath. He even took the lead in capturing the commander and others who were trying to privatize the tower, and gathering information about the slavers and the Dragon King.  The Adventurers Guild had found out that the submaster tried to escape on his own. Because of this, the submaster had been pushed to the other adventurers, and they were still in a serious situation. The submaster’s pitiful behavior had weakened the public’s trust in them, and the chaos would continue.  It seemed that many of the underworld organizations had lost a lot of influence because of this incident. The rumors have spread that they had been reluctant to deploy their forces even though they usually looked important.  From what they heard, it seems that the forces that had been decided beforehand were sent to each gate... But from the point of view of the civilians on the battlefield, they were probably not convinced.  They couldn’t forgive their leaders with feelings, not with reason. Although they were not scouting out the situation, threats against the background of military might not be as effective as they had been in the past.  After all, it reminded me that the people of this city were united and took weapons. If we didn’t do something, we might end up being defeated.  In the first place, there were some areas where they were allowed to work as forces in case of emergency. And if they found it useless, there was no use in leaving the outlaws unchecked. When many citizens realized this, the illegal city might change its appearance.  However, there were some groups that made significant progress among them.  This time, the only one we had full cooperation, the Beastmen Union. Although Mea had instructed them to defeat all of their leaders and take charge of the group, many of them had not forgotten that they had fought together.  Mea had just happened yesterday, but Quina held on to the reins of the group. She had also worked on the reconstruction and was now in a one-on-one win.  The Dragon King Syndicate had fought to fight, but in fact, they were the most powerful. The Dragon King’s devious plan had been exposed, and the civilians resented her. The Dragon King was about to sacrifice Sendia to perform an evil ritual, and a large number of antidemons were led by his men. In such a tone, Frederick must have been spreading rumors among the citizens. He wanted to gather a lot of grudges at the Dragon King so that the honest dragonkin who had participated in the battle could not be blamed.  To put it bluntly, it was probably for Velmeria’s sake too. She had sacrificed the Dragon King as an absolute evil so as not to be ridiculed unreasonably. Velmeria woke up the day before yesterday and apparently was trying to start a new moderate organization called the Dragon King’s Guild.  Velmeria, who had turned into a Divine Dragon, seemed to be treated as a superior to the Dragonmen, and most of the Dragonmen sweared to obey her.Velmeria’s Divine Dragon Form seemed to be viewed as a superior existence to the dragonkin, and most of the dragonkin sweared to obey her.  Well, Velmeria was viewed favorably by the citizens, so they wanted to prove by becoming their subordinates that they were unrelated to the Dragon King.  Gazzol and the other three claws who had sold their names in the battle have been appointed as the executives of the Dragon King’s Guild.Gazzol and the others who had made a name for themselves in the battle have been appointed as the executives of the Dragonmen’s Guild.  That seems to have made the civilians more friendly with the Dragonmen’s Guild.  In the most chaotic Sanatorium, Seliadot and Sophie were busy working together to rebuild.  They restrain Filuria and her men, calm the healers, and regain the trust of the people.  It may sound like arduous, but Sophie’s reputation had been tarnished by this incident.  A saintess in possession of a divine sword and leading the way in fighting. No one would be unpopular right now.  After the cooperation and trust of the citizens, the tower was rapidly being reborn as a new organization. Sophie said it was going to be an open organization with civilian representatives participating in its operations. I don’t know how well it will go, but as long as Sophie’s reputation was high, it should be able to run soundly.  Filuria was apparently missing, which meant Quina and Seliadot were in cahoots.  Well, the chaos was great, but if we kept it alive, it would only cause even more chaos. It was the right thing to pretend that she didn’t know.  </p>
<p>『And then, if Fran wakes up......』</p>
<p>  She took some </p>
<p>「Woof」</p>
<p>  potions to drink, which were nutritious, but she was losing a little more of her strength. Will she be okay if she stayed asleep?  Everyone except Fran was already awake, and I think it was about time for her to wake up.  She looked into Fran’s sleeping face with Urushi, who had already woken up four days ago.  </p>
<p>「...!」</p>
<p>『Huh?  Fran?』</p>
<p>「Woof?」</p>
<p>  I wonder if our wishes have come true.  Fran’s long eyelashes trembled slightly. Then, her eyelids slowly rose.  </p>
<p>『Fran!  Did you wake up?  Fran?』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Y-you’re right...?  Urushi...? Here, where is he?」</p>
<p>『I’m at the Sanatorium.』</p>
<p> Before I could even ask her how she was feeling, a loud sound echoed through the ward.  Growl―! Fran was rubbing her stomach with a pitiful look on her face. </p>
<p>「I’m hungry.」</p>
<p>『I-I see.』</p>
<p>「Curry, I want to try it.」</p>
<p>  Is curry okay after ten days of fasting? It’s not like I’d say it’s something like that in a novel about history, right?But I’m glad Fran woke up after all.</p>
