</div><h1>Chapter 988</h1><p>After seeing off the old man, Fran stared at the old man and the hydrangea for a while.</p>
<p>Then, just when the atmosphere of the place was finally starting to move, she wiped the tears from the corners of her eyes and looked down on her.</p>
<p>Beyond her line of sight was Berserk, placed next to the hydrangea in a sheath.</p>
<p>It seemed like Berserk had lost his power, so he was probably wondering about it.</p>
<p>Sheath made of jet-black so hard that it was hard to believe she was emitting that intense pure white magic power. The Berserk that was placed inside her was also quiet as if she had fallen asleep with the wielder.</p>
<p>She must have noticed Fran’s gaze. The hydrangea then lightly touched the sheath.</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>They stared at each other for a while. However, Fran did not touch Berserk or the sheath at all.</p>
<p>She looked at you and asked General Hagane what he was going to do in the future.</p>
<p>「What are you guys gonna do after this?」</p>
<p>「We have fulfilled our duty. Our forces are not at full power, and we will be in a tight spot any further. We will return here.」</p>
<p>「Yeah.」</p>
<p>Fran nodded her head. I don’t think it was my imagination that she looked a little relieved.</p>
<p>I guess they were afraid that even the hydrangea would end up using Berserk.</p>
<p>Fran’s eyes turned to Berserk again. However, she immediately removed her gaze.</p>
<p>They were curious to see how Fran felt. The hydrangea was looking up at us.</p>
<p>「Black Lightning Princess.」</p>
<p>「What is it?」</p>
<p>「Why don’t you ask that?」</p>
<p>「......Don’t worry about it.」</p>
<p>「Why? Normally they’d ask me instead.」</p>
<p>There was a strange conversation between the hydrangea and Fran. It was a quiet conversation without a subject.</p>
<p>「Dunno.」</p>
<p>「I see. But that’s part of it.」</p>
<p>「Nn? I see?」</p>
<p>「Yeah」</p>
<p>「Thank you」</p>
<p>「I don’t mind」</p>
<p>The pace and the content of the conversation were strange. To be honest, we didn’t know if the conversation was going well or not, and neither we nor the people who were listening to it could exactly understand the meaning of the conversation.</p>
<p>And yet, Fran and the Hydrangea were clearly on the same page.</p>
<p>「Then, Master, Urushi, and I came to understand each other」</p>
<p>Fran decided not to ask him about her scabbard.</p>
<p>Well, it’s national secret, so I’m sure he won’t tell me. If that was the case, it might be safer not to talk about it than to give a bad impression.</p>
<p>Fran didn’t think that much about it though. She didn’t seem to know why she didn’t ask that much question either.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was the result of their feelings of mourning for the young tree and their concern for the hydrangea.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Isario and Zelos Reed were brought back by the messenger.</p>
<p>He must have immediately understood the situation by stroking Fran’s head and bowing his head to the corpse of the ancient tree.</p>
<p>「Thank you very much.」</p>
<p>The same went for the adventurers behind us. They must have heard from Isario.</p>
<p>「Hihihihi! That’s it!」</p>
<p>「...You’re right. I’d like to do that. Let me take a break and have a discussion with you」</p>
<p>「Understood」</p>
<p>「The hydrangea, please go back to the convoy. Please take care of the people of the area」</p>
<p>「Okay, Fran, bye bye」</p>
<p>「Nn. Bye bye」</p>
<p>Fran continued to wave her hand until the Hydrangea with her back facing and the Snow Maiden in her arms disappeared into the carriage.</p>
<p>Behind her, Isario was discussing this with her.</p>
<p>「Can you go back to town on your own?」</p>
<p>「Of course.」</p>
<p>I immediately nodded at Isario’s words. I don’t know if Berserk could use them, since our troops were already half destroyed.</p>
<p>So why was he so confident? Was he trying to be strong enough to not worry about us?</p>
<p>Isario, who had been staring at you for a few seconds, relaxed as if he was slumped, and shook his head lightly and muttered.</p>
<p>「......I don’t like your way of thinking, but I respect you.」</p>
<p>「It’s for the beauty of the younger generation」</p>
<p>「If at all possible, I’d like the old men who survived to return to town in one piece, without wasting their lives」</p>
<p>「For us, there is nothing better than the safety of the Hydrangea and Berserk. The sacrifice to do so is not in vain」</p>
<p>Isario let out a sigh. For me, the only thing that mattered to me was whether or not the hydrangeas reached the town, and they didn’t seem to want to take into account the sacrifice of themselves and the soldiers.</p>
<p>Isario must have mixed feelings because he could understand that.</p>
<p>Isario was also worried about the old men, but they were still killing him. As an outsider, he had no room to interrupt.</p>
<p>In the end, they decided to split up their troops here. Along with Militant Nation of Hagane, they would send out adventurers and knights who could no longer fight.</p>
<p>Since it was a place where we didn’t know when enemies would appear, the troops retreated quickly. Within ten minutes of the decision, the movement began.</p>
<p>As she saw her off at the end of the carriage, Fran raised her hand. Beyond her was a hydrangea staring at us through the skylight of the carriage.</p>
<p>The hydrangea looked expressionless and somewhat apologetic. Maybe it was just themselves worried about escaping.</p>
<p>In Fran’s eyes, she was very concerned for the hydrangea. She was concerned for the loss of her sister, Lake Biwa, and her country’s soldiers.</p>
<p>There was no word to it. Yet the girls’ gazes were intertwined, and they could see each other through something.</p>
<p>「...Bye bye」</p>
