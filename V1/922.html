</div><h1>Chapter 922</h1><p>『Fran! Sorry I kept you waiting!』</p>
<p>「I’m not waiting for you at all」</p>
<p>It felt like a long time because she had dived deep into the world of her mind, but in reality, it was only a few minutes.</p>
<p>Well, the situation had changed drastically in the past few minutes though!</p>
<p>Fran had left the walls and moved forward a great distance. She was completely surrounded by antidemons, but I guess this was easier for her now.</p>
<p>That way, we didn’t have to involve our friends in the fight.</p>
<p>「Teryaa!」</p>
<p>He was in the middle of a massive explosion of black lightning around himself.</p>
<p>(Master, let’s go?)</p>
<p>『Yeah!』</p>
<p>Just by grasping the hilt, I can understand Fran’s evolution. Not only did her stats increase, but her swordsmanship seemed to have been enhanced as well.</p>
<p>I felt a strange aura of elation, as if I was being held by Fran in her Sword God Transformation state.</p>
<p>『Guess I’ll kick you out now!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Fran pulled me out on her back and swung me out with the same momentum. A slash that was simply imbued with magic power. However, it was more powerful than the Sword Saint Technique.</p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>『Hahaha! Amazing! Amazing, Fran!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>So this is the power of the Divine Beast! I thought she was fast enough earlier, but she wasn’t serious yet! What a terrifying speed!</p>
<p>Race: Ragnarok Wolf; Demon Wolf; Magic Beast</p>
<p>After Fran ran through it, several extremely thick black lightning bolts went on a rampage, and antidemons were devoured over a wider area.</p>
<p>Twin antidemons. Whether the color of the antidemons was black or red, it didn’t matter. They were no longer ordinary antidemons, not so different from goblins.</p>
<p>Fran continued to swing me while Fortunately, she managed to defeat the antidemons in her way.</p>
<p>「Master! Something! Something, so fun!」</p>
<p>『Y-You’re looking so motivated!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Fran smiled at me. She was even more excited than usual. Apparently, she was excited by the Divine Beast Transformation.</p>
<p>The elation of getting strong power combined with the increase in wildness of getting closer to the beast.</p>
<p>This may be the first time I’ve ever seen someone this smiling.</p>
<p>(Hey! What kind of power did Master get?)</p>
<p>『Did you want to see it?』</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
<p>『Yeah, I’ll show you the skills I’ve acquired!』</p>
<p>(Ooh!)</p>
<p>I guess I’m feeling the same way. Perhaps the adventurer’s song has the effect of raising the spirits of those who hear it.</p>
<p>『Let’s go! The skill “King Wolf” has been activated!』</p>
<p>Crap!</p>
<p>I could feel a huge amount of magic power coming and going from within me. Well, it was nothing, not that it was just a normal me.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a big consumption for me right now.</p>
<p>「Muh?」</p>
<p>Black magic power covered Fran’s body. Rather than covering her, it was more like a thin veil.</p>
<p>But shouldn’t we say that it had dignity? It was not the same kind of fierceness as evil spirits or black lightning.</p>
<p>I could feel the dignity and dignity of being able to follow the surroundings from Fran, who was clad in black magic power. I guess Fenrir was the one who was radiating the closest atmosphere to us.</p>
<p>The King Wolf skill was an enhancement skill that used Fenrir’s magic power. But that was not the only power of this skill.</p>
<p>The strange occurrence had happened to me too. My decorative strings stretched out with great force, branching out at a tremendous speed. At the same time, I could see that I was trying to shape something by intertwining in a complicated way.</p>
<p>What was more, they were still intertwined and curled up, yet they were further branched out and then swelled up rapidly. It looked as if a huge bunch of giant peak had been lying on the side.</p>
<p>Eventually, each fruit grew bigger and grew larger, separating itself from the surrounding branches.</p>
<p>「「「「Grrrr!」」」」</p>
<p>「Is that the Iron Wolf?」</p>
<p>『That was also the ability of the King Wolf』</p>
<p>It was made of metal wolves about five meters long. I could feel a sense of dwarves’ presence when they looked intimidating.</p>
<p>I knew it was powerful, but to think it was a failed divine sword!</p>
<p>I took Ashwrath’s Mad Ogre with my skill taker, and as a result, I went out of control. After I used my Potential Release, I turned into a steel wolf and attacked Grandma Kiara and Grandma Kiara.</p>
<p>To be honest, I didn’t remember clearly, but I managed to remember at least what I looked like. These wolves looked very similar to me at that time.</p>
<p>The King Wolf skill was a skill that strengthened wielders with Fenrir’s magic power and created steel wolves.</p>
<p>This must be the power that transformed the wielder into the king of wolves. This must be a power that reflected the characteristics of the wolves that were making a flock.</p>
<p>『Ike!』</p>
<p>「Grrrrr!」</p>
<p>「Yeah, amazing!」</p>
<p>The steel wolves were quite strong. Their fangs and claws easily ripped through the antidemons, and their armor repelled only the attacks of lower class antidemons. Antidemons that could keep up with their movements were rare, and every time the wolf ran, they disappeared.</p>
<p>In a flock, they would be able to fight head-on with Urushi before he was enhanced by the oratorio. Well, I wouldn’t be able to win though.</p>
<p>(Is Master moving them all?)</p>
<p>『That’s only half.』</p>
<p>These steel wolves were essentially kin members of the self-governing family. They think and move on an individual level. They may not be conscious, but they do have a kind of autonomous personality.</p>
<p>But these steel wolves were now connected to me. They could move individually and follow my instructions. Moreover, they had perfect control over all the wolves.</p>
<p>I have the Simultaneous Operations skill, but I usually don’t have that much control over it.</p>
<p>This was thanks not only to the King Wolf skill, but also to the Fanatics and Wisdom skills. He was connected to the Steel Wolf created by the King Wolf by fanaticism and was perfectly controlled by his Wisdom.</p>
<p>Wisdom was an ability that Cherubim――or Announcer-san had inherited. A Divine Sword that could access and rephrase information about a Divine Area. People tend to focus on that part, but the most frightening thing was its computing power.</p>
<p>It had the ability to instantly find and select the information you wanted from the library of information from all over the world. It was probably just enough to control ten steel wolves at the same time.</p>
<p>Wang Wolf, Fanatical Skill, and Wisdom. Each of these skills was much weaker than the other skills from the main family.</p>
<p>Wang Wolf was stronger and more powerful. Fanaticism was more fearsome and ugly. Wisdom was wiser and faster.</p>
<p>Perhaps they were only able to demonstrate their abilities by a tenth of what they were originally capable of. However, when they were combined, they were able to demonstrate their true abilities.</p>
<p>『What’s more, this is possible!』</p>
<p>When I ordered one of the steel wolves to burst. But it didn’t mean that it had exploded. Parts of me that consisted of my body had turned into steel threads, rampaging around and ruining the surroundings.</p>
<p>The steel threads that had killed more than a hundred antidemons took the shape of a wolf again. These were both wolves and me.</p>
<p>(Master, amazing!)</p>
<p>『Fufun, right?』</p>
