</div><h1>Chapter 1119</h1><p>After the self-introduction was over, Mareficent called out to the valiant soldiers in the square. </p>
<p>「Yes, yes! Guys! Please gather here! I’ll introduce you to the captain of this unit!」</p>
<p> They knew that she was a Rank A adventurer, so the valiant soldiers in the square gradually started gathering. However, they looked just like they were in a daze and were very slow. Even so, Mareficent and the others were just staring at them smiling. Even so, Mareficent and the others just stared at them smiling.  </p>
<p>「Oh, and I was only hired to be their basic guide, so please have Black Lightning Princess-dono give them instructions as their commander from now on, right? Persona will too, you know?」</p>
<p>「Guide only?」</p>
<p>  If there are Rank A adventurers here, will Fran be treated as a higher-ranked adventurer?  </p>
<p>「Well, I really like heroes.  I’d like to gather stories about heroes, talk to them, and see what they do with my own eyes.  And the newest and fastest hero on this continent is the Black Cat kin’s savior and adventurer, Black Lightning Princess-dono! Well, if you can work for him, we also accept dull requests to show the way to the valiant soldiers!」</p>
<p>「... What do you mean?」</p>
<p>「We’re your fans, so I’d like to observe them up close!  But we’re so busy observing that we don’t do any combat! Well, you don’t mind if we’re gonna do some chores, okay?」</p>
<p>  In other words, she wanted to get closer to Fran and accepted as her guide.  Is that just fanatical? Don’t you feel anything impure about “Fran-chan so cute! ” in there?  If I show him a little strange, he’ll stick my tip in his butt!  </p>
<p>(Master?)</p>
<p>『... For now, Fran says it’s okay to be the captain』</p>
<p>「Okay.  I’m the captain.」</p>
<p>「Of course!  Fran captain!」</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>  A frivolous Mareficent and Persona clapped silently.  Are these guys sure they’ll be okay?  Mareficent then explained to the adventurers who had finally gathered.  </p>
<p>「Ha~i.  This is Fran-dono, the captain. Applause.」</p>
<p>  There were some claps, but most of them were staring at Fran to determine her worth. It was not hostile, but it seemed that they were not acknowledging Fran.  </p>
<p>「Well then, please take care of the rest, okay?」</p>
<p>「Nn.  I’m Fran, the B-ranked adventurer.  captain of this fleet」</p>
<p>「Oi oi, B-ranked? That little girl?」</p>
<p>「I’ve heard rumors about her, you know?」</p>
<p>「A kid is the captain!」</p>
<p>  The whispers of the adventurers who were making a commotion were hardly friendly.  Surprise, jealous, and contempt. It’s going to be hard in the future, but...  However, no one suddenly went on a rampage.  It was probably because they were against a B-ranked adventurer.  Besides, in order to participate as a valiant soldier, it was not a good idea to cause a commotion here. They seemed to understand just how much it was.  As a result, they were at a disadvantage when their rebelliousness and patience clashed, and for the time being, they seemed to be just like a hunk.As a result, they were at a battle of reluctance and patience, and for the time being, they seemed to be just like a hunk.  Also, they were probably influenced by Urushi, who could glare behind Fran.  They looked down at the adventurers with a scary look as if the first one was the most important.  They were a little bigger in size, so they looked so powerful.  </p>
<p>『Well then, what should we do from here?』</p>
<p>  We already had supplies for six carriages. We suggested that we store them in storage and carry them, but Klimut had told us that he wanted the valiant soldiers to train guards and transport. It seemed that these valiant soldiers were capable, but they were judged to be unable to be built into ordinary troops due to various reasons, such as bad behavior and the fear of doing nothing due to their resentment.  Aside from those who had revenge on Raydoss, why would bad behavior adventurers volunteer for a war? The reason for this was their bad behavior.  The Adventurer’s Guild doesn’t force them to participate in war, but they sometimes mediate requests from the government to participate. As a result, some of them were willing to participate in wars and gain rewards or contribution to the guild.  It seemed that even those who do not have a good reputation, such as those who usually do not accept proper requests, could become volunteer soldiers. The government can’t afford to favor them.  There were also those who were planning to plunder in the enemy country. It was a breach of military orders, but I guess some commanders will let them off the hook. Even if such people were to be put into ordinary troops, they would surely lose their footing.  However, it would be a shame to let them play around because they had a decent fighting power.  As a result, they were planned to be given missions such as transporting supplies in small numbers. However, is it possible for children who were specialized in combat to perform plain transportation missions?  If they say it was bad behavior, it reminds me of Krad and the others who had gone into the dungeon with her before, but he was just acting bad and his mission was quite serious.  I guess the guys in this unit were even worse. To put it more bluntly, they were simply scumbags.  We were quite far away from the persona, so I tried appraising them for a try, but it was possible.We were quite far away from Persona, so I tried to give it a try, and I tried to appraise it, but it was possible.  Then, wouldn’t threats, theft, fraud, criminal skills or titles have come out of the blue.  Of course, the guild and the country must have been worried about their behavior.  So, they decided to let them do a transportation mission in advance.  That was what this mission was all about. I guess Mareficent was the one who was watching over the adventurers.  They should be able to tell their attitude during the mission and how serious they were.  The main idea was to know if they were reliable enough to assign their mission in the future.  They also gave them the permission to destroy them if they were attacked by enemies. In a sense, they were also there to uncover the enemy’s forefathers.  Fran was told of her inner emotions so far, so that means she’s on the surveillance side, right? She shouldn’t be treated as a bad person.  We left the carriage to someone with experience in this field, and the others divided into eight or nine groups and ordered to escort their carriages.  We were a little late in our departure because some of them asked us to let the driver go, but we ignored them and started walking dissatisfiedly. As I thought, they were not going to be treated as abandoned in the middle of a mission.  The march was also very slow.  Every time a magic beast came out, the adventurers went to defeat it.  Even though they told us to leave the small fry magic beast behind, they didn’t tell us that it was to protect the supplies. It was clearly to make money. If there were less than a hundred people, the effect of the March of the Valkyrie wouldn’t be activated either.  In the end, only about 60% of the planned progress could be made on the first day, and we would have to go into the camp. We finally understood how difficult Cruz was on the way to the spider’s nest dungeon.  Moreover, the camp could not go quietly either. They had stolen their meals, they didn’t like the order of the guards, they just wanted us to leave quickly, and they didn’t want the little girls to tell them to leave.  They also caused a lot of commotion. </p>
<p>『Fran.  Are you okay?』</p>
<p>(Why are they so annoying?)</p>
<p>『Well, they’re not the type of people who usually follow people.』</p>
<p>  Mareficent just sat quietly without saying anything, but I wonder if more than half of them would be disqualified at this rate.  I’m worried that Fran would be a little off and the number of troops would be a little reduced.The one who attacked Fran forced her to go to bed with his fists, but Fran remained annoyed the whole day. </p>
