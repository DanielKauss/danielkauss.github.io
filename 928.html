</div><h1>Chapter 928</h1><p>『What was that thing about the King Wolf Sword, Fenrir?』</p>
<p>『I see... Even though it’s going to be enhanced, I never thought it would have been at a level where a half-hearted naming would happen. We were both surprised too』</p>
<p>《Yes. Due to the freezing of the name change, some of the power that had lost its destination was on the verge of being runaway》</p>
<p>『That’s it. You mean that the naming process was about to take place, but they didn’t give you a name in the end?』</p>
<p>It was called the King Wolf’s Sword, Fenrir. It looked like a Divine Sword.</p>
<p>My body was a failed divine sword, and with Fenrir-san’s help, I might be able to demonstrate the same power as a divine sword.</p>
<p>However, taking into account the story that my spirit before the battle could not endure, it seemed that my name was not temporarily changed.</p>
<p>『That is... It’s a possibility of the future. Perhaps Master is――one of the futures we might reach』</p>
<p>『Does that mean I can become a Divine Sword?』</p>
<p>『That’s right. The Divine Sword with my power, the King Wolf Sword, Fenrir』</p>
<p>『But you don’t seem to like it, huh?』</p>
<p>『As I said before, Master can’t withstand the fusion with my soul now. The fact that he is able to withstand it means that Master is no longer my Master』</p>
<p>『C-could it be, I have to turn into a sword first? Like the Me over there that Rhyn showed me?』</p>
<p>『That’s right. That’s why it would be a disaster for the current Master to have the name of the King Wolf Sword』</p>
<p>『I see...』</p>
<p>If she didn’t become a sword, she wouldn’t be able to reach the Divine Sword, and when she became a Divine Sword, she would lose me. Sure, she could become stronger, but that was... Fran would be sad.</p>
<p>There’s no way. That’s no good.</p>
<p>『Then, what did you call an Evil Wolf Sword or an Wisdom Sword?』</p>
<p>《It may not be the same as the King Wolf Sword. The Evil Wolf Sword that pulled out the power of the individual named Fenrir, who had been invaded by Evil Spirit. The false Divine Sword, Intelligence Sword, which integrated the residue of the already annihilated Divine Sword. These are the results of the proposal》</p>
<p>『That, too, means another possibility.』</p>
<p>It may seem like a good thing at first glance, but I guess it’s not so from Fenrir’s tone. Fenrir’s bitter tone continued the explanation further.</p>
<p>『Master’s vessel is originally a Divine Sword, he can manipulate the Divine Attribute, and his ability is already a Semi-Divine Sword. Once Master is strengthened, the naming requirements must be met. As an existence, a Divine Sword that could not reach the Divine Sword failed to form. In other words, it would be treated as a failed Divine Sword』</p>
<p>《However, if the individual named Master’s name changes even for a moment, the initiative will be changed to the individual named Fenrir or the individual named Announcer-san》</p>
<p>『That way, I won’t be able to hold back the pieces of the Evil Gods. That’s why I was allowed to stop him from changing his name』</p>
<p>I don’t know the naming system for it, but when it was recognized by the Gods, it naturally gave it a name. It looked like Fran’s equipment, wasn’t it?</p>
<p>Normally, the name would change without permission, but in my case, thanks to Announcer-san and Fenrir, I was able to intervene in the naming process.</p>
<p>That’s why they decided that it would be dangerous to have her name given, so they refused.</p>
<p>『So, in the end, it’s not a good idea to change your name easily huh?』</p>
<p>『That’s exactly what I meant. Master, stay with him and become stronger』</p>
<p>《Yes. That is also the wish of the individual named Fran》</p>
<p>I’m not in love with him, but I’m sure Announcer-san was right.</p>
<p>If I were to become a machine instead of a Divine Sword, Fran would answer that I didn’t need a Divine Sword. I would never need a Divine Sword.</p>
<p>『Oops, it’s time huh.』</p>
<p>《I will go into a dormant state for a while》</p>
<p>『Then let’s say goodbye for a moment, huh?』</p>
<p>《Please treat the individual named Fran while you are dormant》</p>
<p>『Just say hello to Fran!』</p>
<p>Then I could feel the presences of both of them inside me diminishing at once. The strengthening effect was completely gone, and they must have gone into dormant.</p>
<p>For a few days or weeks, I parted ways with my friends I rely on. I returned to the moment I first came to this world, but I felt strangely sorry for them. I guess that was how much I was relying on you two.</p>
<p>If I made a big mistake in this, the two would get angry at me. I’ll have to pull myself together.</p>
<p>Urushi must have noticed that my presence had changed. He looked at me with sleepy eyes.</p>
<p>(Woof?)</p>
<p>『It seems I don’t have to sleep anymore. Leave Fran’s escort to me.』</p>
<p>(Woof!)</p>
<p>『You guys did a great job this time too. Thanks to you and Sophie, we were able to get her support. It’s a little unnoticeable, but fine play.』</p>
<p>(Woof!)</p>
<p>『I know. It’s a treat if it wakes up. So just rest for now』</p>
<p>(Woof woof!)</p>
<p>Race: Ragnarok Wolf; Demon Wolf; Magic Beast</p>
<p>Seeing Urushi like this, Zefmate next to him grunted.</p>
<p>「Muh. How can I sleep still...?」</p>
<p>Zefmate resisted drowsiness and stood as a guardian in front of Mea. She must be trying to do her best as an escort until she was a little more at peace.</p>
<p>This was the difference between Urushi, who knew about my existence, and Zefmate, who didn’t. I wanted to tell him that he could sleep because I was watching, but I couldn’t do that right now.</p>
<p>But then the Goddess of salvation appeared. Well, not so gentle as a Goddess. No, the Goddess of this world is rather strict, so I wonder if she’s the right Goddess?</p>
<p>「Zefmate, please explain it to me」</p>
<p>「Quina,-sama」</p>
<p>「You seem to be a lot of haggards. I never thought you’d sleep in a place like this, even though you were very wary of her......」</p>
<p>It was Quina, Mea’s maid. She was as expressionless as ever.</p>
<p>「Fighting against a horde of antidemons. There you have the help of the saintess......」</p>
<p>Zefmate tried to explain it to her, but because of her drowsiness, she didn’t target him at all. Quina immediately understood this situation and seemed to have given up on hearing from Zefmate.</p>
<p>That’s when her eyes turned to us.</p>
<p>『Quina. I’ll explain it to you, so give Zefmate a break.』</p>
<p>(I was expecting Master to say that. We’ll have to dig up the roots first)</p>
<p>『Okay, please be gentle』</p>
<p>She was going to talk about anything if Quina questioned her. A-A chill that I wouldn’t even feel!</p>
<p>「Zefmate. I’ll escort you to the rest.」</p>
<p>「Understood, I understand...」</p>
<p>Zefmate nodded back at Quina’s words and walked toward the corner of the room with a staggering gait and lay down on the spot. It was the same room as Mea, the master, but she didn’t have time to worry about that either.</p>
<p>「「「「「「Shu~ Shu~」」」」」</p>
<p>From inside the room and the shadows, I could hear a fifth performance of her sleeping breath. Maybe the strangely quiet outside was because the citizens were so concerned about it?</p>
<p>No, it seemed that some of the citizens had fallen asleep too. They must have been able to move because of their high magic power and little mana consumption.</p>
<p>(So? What’s the current situation here?)</p>
<p>『Where should I start explaining it......?』</p>
<p>(If at all possible, from the beginning.)</p>
<p>『Well, it’s quite simple, but let me explain it from the beginning』</p>
<p>We’ve got time anyway.</p>
