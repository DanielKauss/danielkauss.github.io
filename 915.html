</div><h1>Chapter 915</h1><p>Drulayven, the west gate! The arrows of the Dogsinger growled as they pierced through several antidemons and disappeared. The power of the arrows emitted from the dragonkin’s mana was worthy of a one-hit-kill. Even if they now knew that we were friends, they begin to shiver every time we passed by. Some of their subordinates were really scared. When we asked Miranleil if there were any arrows that didn’t make a sound at first, she replied with a nice smile on her face. When we asked Miranleil if there were any arrows that didn’t make a sound at first, she replied with a good smile on her face.  I guess those arrows have a lot of meaning behind it.  According to Miranleil, </p>
<p>「My arrow is just like a dragon’s roar! The enemy I hear is frightened, and my friend is inspired!」</p>
<p>  I think dragon roars are frightening to my friend too, right?  Well, I can understand that.  If a person dies every time that sound is made, the enemy will be intimidated.  Soon, every time they hear a similar sound, they may panic.  At the same time, morale on their side will increase.  But antidemons have halved their effects. After all, they don’t have the noble feeling of being frightened by them.  They used to be hostile with each other. Many of them were worried about when they would be targeting her from behind and that arrow would pierce them.  However, there was no doubt that she was the best fighter she could be.  The antidemons this time were several times larger than usual. It would be a problem if they didn’t do something bad and were unmotivated.  Well, he was the type of person who would never turn a blind eye if they denied his insistence.  There was no doubt about it. </p>
<p>「It can’t be helped.  I’ll go to the front too.  I’ll leave the commander to you.」</p>
<p>「O-Okay!  Be careful, big brother!」</p>
<p>  I was in the third seat of the Bloodfang Brigade.  I’m confident in close combat. I’m not much of a skill that can raise the morale of my subordinates by fighting so flashyly on the front lines.  </p>
<p>「Short teleport!」</p>
<p>  I used a short-range teleport to leap into the middle of the enemy.  To be honest, a teleport skill of my caliber would not be very useful in a real battle. Both chanting and hoarding are very long. But just the fact that we had someone with rare skills on our side raised our ally’s spirits.  </p>
<p>「Uwooorgh!  Keep up with Drulay’s big brother!」</p>
<p>  The momentum of the underlings sent the other groups rushing in. There were too many antidemons, so if they didn’t have that much momentum, they wouldn’t be able to shove them all away.  Buven!  The Dogsinger’s Arrow flew away again.  Come on, hey, it was right next to me right now, right? Don’t be aiming for it, okay?  </p>
<p>「Oi.  Announcer-san!」</p>
<p>「Yeah!」</p>
<p>「Tell the Dogsinger to tell me.  Shoot harder!」</p>
<p> That’s the fucking hell of a deal! Side The south gate, Gephe.  </p>
<p>「Don’t you fucking play dumb with me!  One-chan!」</p>
<p>「That’s my line!  Damn lizard!」</p>
<p>「Ah?」</p>
<p>「Ahh!?」</p>
<p>  I never thought I’d end up in the same situation as these guys! Always rush at me like this! It seems I have to tell you this is higher than me!  </p>
<p>「Oi iii!  The dog is here! Let’s fight!」</p>
<p>「Just like you wished, the lizard!」</p>
<p>「Who will beat the antidemons in this battle! The match is won by points!」</p>
<p>「Fine! Don’t do anything rash!」</p>
<p>「Don’t you fucking play dumb with me!」</p>
<p>「That’s my fucking line!  Damn!」</p>
<p>「That’s my fucking line!  Damn weak!」</p>
<p>  We showed each other’s antidemon cards and spread them out as soon as we showed them to each other. If we went too close, we would end up losing against them too.  We’d be at full throttle from the start! There were a lot of antidemons this time, so I couldn’t help but feel bad about those who would kill me!  </p>
<p>「Shaaah! Evil Trait!」</p>
<p>  What I used was a ranged attack that used evil energy.  This technique had almost no wielder except for half-evil dragonkin. Even if they were on this continent, it would be treated as an evil act on a different level.  The evil energy disturbs the antidemons’ magic and reduces their defenses. The shockwave released with them landed a direct hit on them, crushing the antidemons’ bodies.  The antidemons, whose ecology was similar to that of magic beasts, were good ducks for me. I won by defeating them like this!  </p>
<p>「Uoooooooh!」</p>
<p>  Tch!  I was feeling the good mood while defeating the antidemons.  Wangon used his beast-smelling awakening to defeat them. I seriously cannot underestimate the ones who behaved like that.  Their roars have properties that disrupt magic power, just like my evil spirits.  </p>
<p>「Can you crush them! You’re a stray dog that can’t discipline us!」</p>
<p>「You fucking fucking fucking look black on you! Shall we do this whole antidemon?」</p>
<p>「Aaah?」</p>
<p>「Aaahhhh?」</p>
<p>「... Haah.  You guys never get tired of it every time you see me.」</p>
<p>  As I was training my shitty dog, it felt like the mouths of my subordinates had moved in some way. </p>
<p>「Did you say something to them?」</p>
<p>「N-Nothing.」</p>
<p>「Hahahaha! It seems that their ears have finally gotten farther away!」</p>
<p>「Shut up!  Don’t steal me! That’s why you should be a stray dog!」</p>
<p>「Damn!  Black lizard!」</p>
<p>「Ahh?」</p>
<p>「Aaahhhh?」</p>
<p>「...You’re getting along, dude?」</p>
<p> Did he say anything else again? Side Gazzol the north gate </p>
<p>「Bryne, I’m going to the front.  Can you cover for me?」</p>
<p>「Ou, I’ll leave it to you!  I think it’ll be easy on the battlefield like this one.」</p>
<p>「What are you mumbling about? I’m sure it’ll be hellish busy soon anyway.」</p>
<p>「Okay!  That’s just a joke!」</p>
<p>  The man who waved his hand and smirked was Bryne, first seat of the Bloodfang Brigade. He’s a belligerent and crude man, but he’s kind of passionate and doesn’t think anyone would be so reliable on the battlefield.  He was a person who had killed each other before, but he was not a person who was dragged into a cause and made a wrong decision. So, I was relieved to be left to him.  This man was strong as a warrior, but his true nature was in command in the middle of the guard. He could use wind magic to weaken his enemies with long-range attacks and his unique skill, the “Cursed Attack”.  In addition, he could use multiple command skills to inspire his comrades and improve their abilities. I may be superior than him in terms of pure combat power, but Bryne was by far the more perfect combat commander.  </p>
<p>「Windscales!  That thing is...  coming!」</p>
<p>「Indeed it! You can do it at any time!」</p>
<p>「Hah!  Blow them up!」</p>
<p>  Bryne shot a wind spell at me, but it wasn’t a false shot. My wind wall had the ability to incorporate wind magic and increase its thickness.  Knowing this, Bryne unleashed her attack magic at me.  She had the opportunity to fight alongside me in a battle to defend against antidemons before, and we did the same.  </p>
<p>「Tch!  They’re as tough as ever! My wind has completely swallowed me!」</p>
<p>「Fuhahaha! It will take a lot of skill to break through my wind wall with wind magic!」</p>
<p>「Eventually, I’ll blow them up!」</p>
<p>  Despite saying so, Bryne had already started to eliminate the antidemons around me. She was still complaining loudly as usual, but her work was quick.  She was trying to pick a fight with someone like her, right? Come to think of it, I don’t know why, since his vicious side seemed so cute.  </p>
<p>「What the hell? You shouldn’t be grinning on the battlefield after all.」</p>
<p>「Oops, I’m sorry.」</p>
<p>「Seriously, you better get serious!」</p>
<p>「Hahaha! I know!」</p>
<p>  As a result of this exchange, a tremendous roar echoed through the air. According to the report from one of their subordinates at the top of the wall, the city wall on the east side had been destroyed.  </p>
<p>「Mrgh.  What should we do?  Bryne! Do you think we should send a reinforcement from here?」</p>
<p>「That’s impossible!  We’ve got a lot of work to do on our side too! Besides, I’m worried that Sibylla’s party is already gone!」</p>
<p>  Bryne was right, we didn’t have enough time to defend the city. The scale of the antidemon season was different from usual.  For the past few times, we had only been attacked by about 40 or 50 thousand antidemons. I wouldn’t say that it can be easily defended, but the forces of Sendia had certainly defeated the hordes.  This year, nearly fifty thousand antidemons were at each gate. On the contrary, the east gate seemed to be filled with even more antidemons.  </p>
<p>「Windscales! Focus your first on the defense of this place!」</p>
<p>「Indeed!  How can we do it!」</p>
<p>  All I can do is draw in the antidemons here and protect the gate! That will be the support for the saintess and Black Lightning Princess-dono!  </p>
<p>「I will protect this place even if I die!」</p>
<p>「Haha!  Exactly!」</p>
<p>Side Ashwrath </p>
<p>「Well, I guess I’ll be the one to do this.」</p>
<p> Just a little west of the illegal city of Sendia, a swarm of over 100,000 antidemons were marching eastward.  At first they were chasing after the dragonkin acting suspiciously to guide the antidemons. We caught a few of them, but they were already too late when we realized their plots.  They used themselves as bait to gather antidemons and lure them into Sendia. The Dragon King ordered them to do so, but they had no time to ask for more details.  We already knew the other hordes were on their way to Sendia. Oh, that’s what the holy knights said.  I never thought I’d run into those bastards in a place like this. They’ve whispered to me before they seep into the dirt.  Silard has been sending an assailant to steal my divine sword.  We had fought with him many times in retaliation for that. To be honest, I’d say they were hostile to each other. The ones who were called holy knights in particular were famous for their poor quality, as they were occupied by their bond with the nobles.  The divine sword knights had a hard time because they had to use them. Well, I don’t sympathize with them because they hate him.  He’s not a bad guy, but he’s deposited too much of his reason for action with the country.  He’s way too much of a match for me.  </p>
<p>「Oh right, we’re going to deal with the antidemons first.」</p>
<p> If they get together, we won’t be able to withstand anything in that town.  </p>
<p>「There are a lot of people in that town who don’t want to die.Let’s go on a rampage!</p>
