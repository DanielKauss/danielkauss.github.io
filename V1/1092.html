</div><h1>Chapter 1092</h1><p>「Uwaah, Fran-san has gained so much dismantling power! That’s a happy estimate」</p>
<p>「Fermus is also amazing」</p>
<p>A few days after we slew the mountain dragon.</p>
<p>We dismantled the mountain dragons at the training hall of the Adventurer’s Guild in Barbra. Normally, a dragon was supposed to be dismantled in a proper facility.</p>
<p>After all, small shards of meat and scales, and even a drop of blood flowing down on them were precious. It was not at the level of a gold coin in a single bottle, but it was just a few silver coins.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Mountain Dragon this time was an advanced dragon, and its material was also worth more than normal. The Adventurer’s Guild was also in an uproar because it could get a larger amount of it than normal.</p>
<p>I’d eaten the magic stones, and Eiworth and Fermus would use their share on their own. Even so, Gamudo and Diaz’s share would definitely be passed on to the distribution network of the Adventurer’s Guild. I heard that if there were a large number of high-level dragon materials, there would be commotion in various places.</p>
<p>If it hadn’t been during the war, there would have been an auction and an information war between the nobles.</p>
<p>However, we couldn’t go into the dismantling room for a mountain dragon. After all, it was one of the biggest in the world.</p>
<p>And if we didn’t manage to get into the facility, it would have been difficult to dismantle it properly. No, I wouldn’t have a problem anywhere if we just dismantled, but our blood would be quite in vain.</p>
<p>So, after discussing it with Fran and the old man, they decided to work together to dismantle the mountain dragon.</p>
<p>First, Fran and Eiworth set up wind and ice magic wards to block the dripping blood and other substances.</p>
<p>After that, they repeatedly took out a few mountain dragons from storage and roughly cut them apart.</p>
<p>It would take less than three minutes if the high-ranking adventurers were serious on the work of cutting them up to about 10 meters. After Fran re-storages them, she dismantles each part in detail within the barrier.</p>
<p>Fran and Fermus were mainly in charge of this. We already had some dismantling skills ready, so it was natural and fast. Fran dismantled the mountain dragons at high speed, while I transformed into the most suitable form.</p>
<p>However, Fermus’ technique was also quite impressive. His strings were too versatile. He sliced up the meat, peeled off the bone and the meat, and then cut off the scales all at once. All of this was done at the same time.</p>
<p>I was confident in my dismantling, but I’m sure he was losing at high speed. As one would expect from a cook and a former A-Ranked adventurer.</p>
<p>Eiworth then instantly frozen the ball of material, and Gamudo and Diaz stuffed it into an item box and the like. Everyone continued to work silently as if it were flowing, and the super huge mountain dragon was dismantled in less than two hours.</p>
<p>「Haha! I never thought I’d get such a high-quality material! I have not abandoned my intuition when I whispered that I should come here!」</p>
<p>「Ayworth! The poison in your head has lowered the quality of your tongue! You said you wanted that much!」</p>
<p>「Fermus! But rather than that, are you sure you want me to get this meat?」</p>
<p>「Can I go to Barbra but also to Ulmut?」</p>
<p>Both Eiworth and Fermus had abandoned their ownership of the meat, which was their share. Eiworth had no way to use it. As long as Fermus was allowed to cook it, that was all that matters.</p>
<p>Fermus was definitely a tsundere, but Eiworth seemed to mean that they didn’t really need it. Anyway, it seemed that most of the dragon meat was going to be used to cook for the people. So, it was a luxurious soup stock.</p>
<p>The sight of dozens of huge tube-shaped meat that exceeded the height of a human being was quite impressive. It even looked like a meat-producing facility from a science fiction work, rather than a fantasy.</p>
<p>Anyway, this would be enough to bring them in to receive assistance from the government.</p>
<p>Gamudo approached Fran after she had finished her work, wiping the sweat off her forehead.</p>
<p>「Fran, why don’t you have a mock battle with me?」</p>
<p>「Mock battle with Gamudo?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. I’d like to experience the power of you guys who sent Fermus and Diaz flying」</p>
<p>「Nn. Okay」</p>
<p>「Oh! I see!」</p>
<p>The other old men showed no signs of stopping Gamudo. Diaz and Eiworth were amused, and Fermus seemed more worried about Gamudo. However, Diaz gave them a word of advice.</p>
<p>「Both of you. I can’t go all out here, so it’s pretty light, right?」</p>
<p>「Yeah!」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Both of their weapons were wooden weapons for mock battles, and I didn’t think they would be that bad... But when push comes to shove, I’ll have to stop them forcibly.</p>
<p>The mock battle that began then became unexpectedly quiet and yet heated.</p>
<p>They didn’t use flashy techniques or magic, only their martial arts skills. They didn’t call out to each other to do so, but they seemed to do so while they were checking each other out.</p>
<p>At first, Fran attacked lightly, but Gamudo continued to use his shield and axe to defend well. Neither of them was serious, but...</p>
<p>Fran seemed to be starting to heat up little by little in the face of Gamudo’s toughness. She was starting to trial and error in trying to beat Gamudo’s defenses with only her skills without using any skills.</p>
<p>Gamudo was Gamudo, and he must be feeling like stepping on a thin ice wall. To Fran, he seemed to have some leeway, but I could tell that he was in a great hurry. But the elders had decided not to use the skill either.</p>
<p>As a result of the clashes between the two their prides in such a way, they were able to continue their battle with only their weapon techniques. It looked like they were evenly matched, but Gamudo seemed to have a bit more advantage right now. The defensive side, which moved less, was less taxing.</p>
<p>Well, I’d say Gamudo was by far the better opponent for mental exhaustion, and the fight would turn into a complete turnaround in a few minutes. Fran’s attacks were only getting sharper and sharper. She had grown up fighting along the way. But this was more than expected.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>「Muh...」</p>
<p>「That weapon was really unbearable」</p>
<p>Fran’s wooden sword had been shattered. Even though it had been strengthened by the flow of magic power, it could not withstand the battle between Fran and Gamudo.</p>
<p>「Phew...... It’s a draw.」</p>
<p>「......Nn.」</p>
<p>Gamudo’s long breath of shield cracked as he pulled us together......</p>
<p>(Loss.)</p>
<p>『No, I think it’s a pain-sharing skill, right?』</p>
<p>(...I’ve lost.)</p>
<p>As for Fran, she thinks she can at least be judged as defeated.</p>
<p>As I’ve expected, a cunning opponent who has been building on his experience can’t be underestimated. We should be proud of this result to Gamudo, who has a strength stronger than that.</p>
<p>That’s comparable to a former Rank A adventurer who had been in battle for decades without any skills.</p>
<p>The old men were smiling bitterly at Fran as she gripped her fist in frustration. But this was exactly what made Fran happy.</p>
<p>『Looks like we can win next time』</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
