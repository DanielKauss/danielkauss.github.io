</div><h1>Chapter 953</h1><p>「Young miss, are you about to take a break?」</p>
<p>「Nn? What happened?」</p>
<p>「You’re still fine. The uncle doesn’t have the strength, so he’s already tired」</p>
<p>「Okay」</p>
<p>We left Bulltori early in the morning for an investigation request. Half a day then passed since then.</p>
<p>We were on our way to the central part of the continent. There was the castle of Trismegistus and the place where the main source of the antidemons, the Abyss Eaters, rested.</p>
<p>We actually got information about Trismegistus and his beloved sword from the Silver Lady along with the Divine Sword. We didn’t know who he was, but we did know where he was and what he was capable of.</p>
<p>In the middle of the continent, there was a small castle, which Trismegistus used as a sleeping quarters.</p>
<p>Well, our destination was a little before that though.</p>
<p>It was a job to check the number of antidemons in the center of the country and see if there were any abnormalities.</p>
<p>Isario said he was tired, but I guess he was worried about Fran, who hadn’t had anything to eat since our departure this morning.</p>
<p>Fran landed on Urushi and immediately began to prepare the meal.</p>
<p>In the middle of the wilderness with a nice view, I created a table with earth magic. Thanks to the increase in her ability to use earth magic, she had a clean table without any distortion. The table was complete with white cloth covering it.</p>
<p>Well, I gave the order in telepathy. Fran doesn’t mind just like that, but I really want her to enjoy it even a little. Isario also has his share of Isario’s worth too, right?</p>
<p>「I-I’m stuck with the details too」</p>
<p>「Master’s Commitment」</p>
<p>「Hmm? You mean you were taught that? I think you’re a good Master」</p>
<p>Isario nodded admiringly and sat down in the chair in front of him. He seemed to really admire her because he knew the importance of eating.</p>
<p>I took out stew and carrage. Fran probably wanted to eat the curry, but she had eaten it this morning as well. So, she had prepared it differently considering the nutritional balance.</p>
<p>「Mogu mogu」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>Fran and Urushi began to shovel in the stew and a super-sized piece of karaage. I wanted to wipe the stew from their mouths, but it was right in front of Isario.</p>
<p>hungry was the best spice, but Fran and Urushi were the same eaters at all times. A mountain of carrage disappeared in no time at all.</p>
<p>Isario glanced at us. He couldn’t hide his envious expression, but he didn’t say he wanted it.</p>
<p>Even this bad old man must have known that it was too bad to eat a child’s food. He then began to eat a sandwich of spiciness and ham.</p>
<p>I think it was a good meal for an adventurer, but it seemed to be in front of Fran without a taste. She looked a little subtle.</p>
<p>Fran then glanced at Isario. She gently lifted three more dishes with carrage remaining and placed them in front of Isario.</p>
<p>「I’ll give it to you」</p>
<p>「......Are you sure?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Thanks!」</p>
<p>She didn’t have to say that she wanted it, but if she was told to give it to me, she would. So much so that she couldn’t help but tell me to give it back, and she carried a dish of carrage.</p>
<p>「T-This is...!」</p>
<p>「Is it good?」</p>
<p>「Yeah! Ugh! It’s great that there’s liquor in this!」</p>
<p>Thank goodness. Apparently, she didn’t bring any liquor with her. This bad daddy looks like he’s drinking normally.</p>
<p>Just as that thought passed through my mind, Fran took out several bottles of it. It had somehow become liquor.</p>
<p>『Wha, Fran? Where did you get it!?』</p>
<p>(This is the guild’s bar, with any leftovers.)</p>
<p>Fran was strangely interested in liquor. It seems that the liquor that had been left for the day of the party had been stored in storage before she knew it.</p>
<p>「Eh? Young lady?」</p>
<p>「I’ll give it to you」</p>
<p>「No, even uncle can’t claim to be here...」</p>
<p>「...It makes you stronger to drink, right? You don’t know what’s going on, so you’d better be in good physical condition」</p>
<p>「I-is that so?」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>I believed what Isario said! Come to think of it, I didn’t deny it either. I thought it would be better to be serious drinking!</p>
<p>「Yes」</p>
<p>「Y-Yeah.」</p>
<p>Isario picked up the bottle with a look of determination. After all, this was no lie.</p>
<p>「......Okay, but I don’t have much strength left. I think I can only play one more time.」</p>
<p>I’ll have this dad take responsibility for what he says.</p>
<p>Isario looked troubled and took a sip of the wine. And then his eyes widened. Well, the one inside was the extremely high-level wine. It was the so-called spirit.</p>
<p>Three of them were placed in front of Isario. They had punch power that was so tremendous that even an S-ranked adventurer hesitated a little.</p>
<p>But Isario did not run away. She grabbed the bottle with a determined look on her face and started drinking it at once. If it were an average person, they would probably be overwhelmed by acute alcohol poison.</p>
<p>『Guys, don’t do anything rash!』</p>
<p>(Master?)</p>
<p>『Fran, even if she becomes able to drink in the future, she shouldn’t drink that way, right? You have to taste it and drink a little at a time, okay?』</p>
<p>(Got it.)</p>
<p>Apparently, he’s a bad teacher for Fran. Well, it looks like he’s bad for Fran’s education, but I’ll forgive him this time.</p>
<p>「Yeah~, it was delicious」</p>
<p>「Yeah.」</p>
<p>「T-Thank you very much」</p>
<p>So, let’s take a break for now. Well, let’s get rid of it when we leave.</p>
<p>Fran, who had removed the table with a chair, leaned on Urushi, and Isario sat on a suitable stone. Fran was in perfect condition, sensing Urushi’s body heat.</p>
<p>Isario seemed to be resting his body as well.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of silence, Isario suddenly opened his mouth.</p>
<p>「Hey, young miss.」</p>
<p>「What is it?」</p>
<p>「Why do you want to come to this continent?」</p>
<p>Isario’s face was as expressionless as ever. I couldn’t tell from his expression whether he was really wondering if he was just starting a chat or not.</p>
<p>However, her eyes seemed to be a little more serious than before. Fran noticed this and straightened her posture a little.</p>
<p>Well, he still approached Urushi though.</p>
