</div><h1>Chapter 1095</h1><p>Count Bailleys was also supposed to be in charge of finding out if Satia was planning to plot anything. Half an hour after he left, Satia, who had been waiting in the reception room, was led to a different room again. Fran was waiting here. Since she was going to an audience with the Kranzel King, she could not bring her escort with her. Philias royalty was known to use demon power, and they wanted to minimize their forces in case Satia’s goal was to assassinate the king. I don’t know what Fran would do if that was the case. If Satia’s goal was to assassinate the king, they won’t know what Fran will do.  They also seemed to want to make a mount. Therefore, they wanted to show Satia that they were superior to them.  Kranzel side had a large number of people, including guards, and Satia was alone. That implied that they were in the positions of the two countries. The relationship between the countries was not just a matter of being friendly, and this was just a bargain.  Even so, Fran, who was waiting, was in an infinite number of tea and pastry parties. Food was replenished from the moment she ate it.  They already ate a few dozen high-quality sweets like those served at the royal palace, right?  A few maids would never change their expressions at all, wouldn’t they?  If it were me, I’d definitely be making them look confused.  But all of them were expressionless.  As expected of the servants of the royal castle. They were all professional.  However, it was Fran who changed her expression here.However, it was Fran who changed her expression here.  There was a slight hint of suspiciousness around the royal castle.  Since it was only a moment away, we couldn’t follow her anymore.  However, it was obvious that she was using skills and magic to disguise her presence.  </p>
<p>(Enemy?)</p>
<p>『Hmmm.  I don’t know.  At this distance, I don’t sense any hostility or malice.』</p>
<p>  I don’t know if she was an enemy stealthy or a dark part of the Kranzel Kingdom. If it was the latter, it would be best to make a scene.  We were not the only ones who reacted to this presence.  No, did they react to Fran’s reaction to something? It was one of the maids who had been waiting in the corner of the room.  I actually knew that she was much stronger than the other maids. She must be both a guard and a guard.  She walked toward us with her left hand on her ear.  </p>
<p>「Did you notice it?」</p>
<p>「Outside the royal castle?」</p>
<p>「I knew it...  That’s an amazing ability」</p>
<p>  She was surprised to hear Fran’s presence in the distance. But she quickly returned to her face and told Fran not to do anything.  </p>
<p>「This person is handling the situation. I can’t move now」</p>
<p>「... Okay」</p>
<p>  The earring in her left ear must be a magic tool for communication.  It seemed that she was checking the situation outside. </p>
<p>「What’s going on?」</p>
<p>「I’m still getting the details. However, there is a high possibility that the one who disappeared with magic has entered the Royal Capital」</p>
<p> So it’s a stealth agent of the Raidos Kingdom?  If the Royal Capital has allocated a lot of power to the north, the security there would be laxer now. Fran was a little annoying. She’s getting bored of it, but she can’t move around here on her own.  We’ll have to wait for Satia, and if we’re gonna do anything strange in the royal castle, we’ll be the criminals.  Another hour later, just as Fran’s stomach was starting to swell, Satia finally came back to haunt us. Her expression also showed that the meeting with the King was not a bad response.  </p>
<p>「Fran-san.  I will be staying at the royal castle for you. The escort request will be completed here」</p>
<p>「Nn. Okay」</p>
<p>「Thank you very much, really」</p>
<p>  Satia bows her head deeply.  Remaining in the royal castle also meant that she is, in a sense, a hostage. She would never rest her mind completely.  Even so, Satia smiled.  She seemed to have made up her mind. </p>
<p>「I’ll do my best to be a bridge between the two countries」</p>
<p>  Fran also smiled slightly and cheered on Satia.  Then, she hugged her.  </p>
<p>「Nn. Do your best, but don’t push yourself too hard」</p>
<p>「Yes」</p>
<p>「I’m coming to see you.」</p>
<p>「Yes......!」</p>
<p>  The two continued to hug each other for a while.  We parted ways with Satia and went to the Adventurer’s Guild.  That was what I thought, but it seemed that we still had some business to attend to. The maid told me to wait just a little longer.  Satia waved her hands over and over again and, in a few minutes, a new figure appeared in the room.  It was a small, old woman wearing a strange object. Was this a sofa made of sand?  The old woman was wrinkled and looked weak not only from her appearance but also from her presence.  However, if she was manipulating that much dust magic, she couldn’t be weak. She must be good at hiding her abilities.  A beautiful robe with a little greenish-grey hair and flower-tree-motif emblems on it. Her hair ornaments and ring look just like a classy old woman.  However, when she opened her mouth, the impression of her dissipated.  </p>
<p>「I’ll say my apologies in this state. Are you Black Lightning Princess-san?」</p>
<p>  It was a very smug voice and tone.  </p>
<p>「Nn.  Who are you?」</p>
<p>「Hiyaahaha. I’m Esmeralda, a pitiful old hag who’s been defeated by incompetent former subordinates who have lived a leisurely and self-absorbed life」</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p> Well, it wouldn’t be surprising if she had retired due to her age, but what is such a retired old lady doing here? While we were puzzled, the maid supplemented us. </p>
<p>「This person was originally the one in charge of the intelligence department of the Kingdom of Kranzel」</p>
<p>「It was more than twenty years ago. But she pulled her out because she lacked a hand due to Ashtner’s rebellion」</p>
<p>「I’m sorry, but we need the help of Esmeralda-sama of the </p>
<p>『Summitary』</p>
<p>「Hmph.  In the first place, I can’t let her cause a rebellion anymore.  I told her to be careful of Ashtner when she retired.  Well, the government will reward her at most.  But more importantly, Black Lightning Princess. She has actually received a job request」</p>
<p>「A request?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. I like kids with a strong will.  I don’t want to serve a country.  It’s a huge pain.  I’ve been itching all along. </p>
<p>「So, you were an adventurer?」</p>
<p>「Unfortunately until 40 years ago.  You were a former Rank A too」</p>
<p>  They were the same as Gwad and the others, but they were probably even older than those old men.</p>
<p>「Request?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. I’d really like to recruit at our academy, but you’re not really interested in working for the academy, right?」</p>
<p>「Nn. I’m an adventurer」</p>
<p>「Yeah. I like kids with a good will. And it’s not like I’m going to serve a country after all. It’s only a matter of time. How many times have I wanted to go back to being an adventurer?」</p>
<p>「So, you were an adventurer?」</p>
<p>「Unfortunately until 40 years ago. You were a former Rank A too」</p>
<p> They were the same as Gwad and the others, but they were probably even older than those old men. At any rate, I could tell that this old woman was someone I definitely didn’t want to enemy of.</p>
