</div><h1>Chapter 1069</h1><p>In the center of the plaza, a blonde boy and girl were discussing something with serious looks on their faces. Fran’s friends, Princess Fran, and Princess Satya.</p>
<p>Now we know that this demon knight belonged to the Kingdom of Philias.</p>
<p>In the corner of the plaza, there was a pile of corpses that looked like soldiers from the Kingdom of Raidos. I think they must have eliminated the soldiers from Raidos and recaptured the village... But the only problem was why the demon knights tried to eliminate us.</p>
<p>If Philias were in coordination with the Kingdom of Kranzel, I wouldn’t understand why they would have killed Fran under the name of an adventurer.</p>
<p>However, if Philias were to effectively control this village and turn it into his country’s territory, there was a possibility that he would be attacked.</p>
<p>『Fran, don’t leave yet, okay?』</p>
<p>(Got it.)</p>
<p>The only problem was how to confirm their will. And how to deal with them if they become an enemy. Especially if they become hostile, will Fran be able to fight with the two?</p>
<p>Do we need to fight in the first place? As an adventurer, Fran is not directly employed by the Kranzel Kingdom, and we are in a position to not have to fight against them.</p>
<p>Well, we’ll no longer be able to go into the Kingdom of Kranzel, so we need to move our base to the Beast Kingdom area. To be frank, we won’t have to participate in the war, and I was feeling okay with that then, okay?</p>
<p>As I was thinking about how I should move in the future, Fran’s body shivered. I soon understood why.</p>
<p>『Is that a demon?』</p>
<p>(They both look strong.)</p>
<p>『At the very least, it’s the strongest demon I’ve ever seen.』</p>
<p>Behind Fran and Satia, something huge, humanoid, appeared. It was clearly a demon.</p>
<p>Behind Fult stands a male-type about five meters tall, with dragon-like wings. It looks much more human than the demons we’ve seen before. Its skin is brown, and its hair is white. It carries a huge black scythe.</p>
<p>What appeared behind Satya was a female-type demon about five meters tall. She didn’t have a weapon, but her long hair wriggled as if it had a will of its own, and purple smoke poured out from the corners of her mouth.</p>
<p>Both of them had brown skin and gray hair, and the eyes were completely covered with a black leather eye patch, so it was impossible to tell. The leather equipment that protected their vital points was also designed to be very similar. So, there was no doubt that the two demons were the same species.</p>
<p>The only problem was what to do if I called such a powerful demon――</p>
<p>「......I’m sorry, but it was for our people.」</p>
<p>「I’m sorry」</p>
<p>When Fran and Satya uttered their apologies, they bowed their heads to the villagers. What appeared on their faces was exactly what they felt depressed.</p>
<p>Isn’t this really bad?</p>
<p>Fran declared so, ignoring the voices of the villagers who had sensed a disturbing presence and began to raise their voices.</p>
<p>「First, you have to fight with those bandits. Kill them. Pune!」</p>
<p>「I’ll send him to you peacefully. Ronoue.」</p>
<p>「Urooourgh!」</p>
<p>「Wooo~f!」</p>
<p>The dragonkin beastman, Bune, obeyed orders to reap the scythes. The robbers at his feet fell to the bone, and blood spurted from the cut section.</p>
<p>Ronowe’s attack was even more shocking. What was more, when his arms split as if they were exploded, they became countless tentacles that attacked the bandits. thick tentacles easily crushed human skulls and took their lives.</p>
<p>The villagers screamed and tried to escape, but they were unable to move properly because of the restraints on their limbs.</p>
<p>That was a blink of an eye. What the hell was that Fran and Satya doing!?</p>
<p>「Next up, I’m coming with you too」</p>
<p>「Wooo~f!」</p>
<p>Amidst my confusion, Fran jumped forward in a reflexive way.</p>
<p>「I won’t let you!」</p>
<p>She ran at a super godly speed, deflecting the first blow that Bune swung at the child. In addition, she avoided the second blow that was swung down at Fran, and Fran’s kick landed a direct hit on Bune’s chest.</p>
<p>Even the giant demon must have been able to withstand its blow. It was blown away a few meters and forced to retreat.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t the demon that Fran was looking at.</p>
<p>「Frut! Satya!」</p>
<p>「F-Fran...」</p>
<p>「Fran-san. Why, are you here...?」</p>
<p>It was the worst reunion we had ever seen. A look of dismay clearly appeared on the face of the prince and princess.</p>
<p>「Why are you here? Besides, why did you do this!」</p>
<p>「...For our homeland」</p>
<p>「I-I’m sorry」</p>
<p>Drulay was probably triggered by the disturbance in Fran and Satia, or the demon’s movements stopped. Was killing the villagers for the sake of his country? Was it even necessary to deploy the royalty to destroy the country?</p>
<p>A large number of people were trapped in the square, but they still looked like normal people.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection, I saw that there was something left around Fran and Urushi’s standing. It seemed to be a large magic stone. I appraised it to see if it was a magic stone, but...</p>
<p>We were about to ask more questions, but someone interrupted us.</p>
<p>「Both of you! I don’t have time to have a conversation now!」</p>
<p>「B-but......」</p>
<p>「Fran-san is my savior!」</p>
<p>The old demon knight scolded Fran and the others. The demon knight shouted even more at the prince as he tried to say something back.</p>
<p>「Are you going to abandon the people?! Fulfill your duty as royalty! This village will be destroyed after all! If that is the case, our country must protect it alone!」</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>I felt a power returning to Fran and Satia’s faces. It was a look of determination, in a bad way.</p>
