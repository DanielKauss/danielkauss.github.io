</div><h1>Chapter 995</h1><p>The golden light flew freely through the vast underground space, obliterating the antidemons as if they were lucky enough to be hit. Trismegistus’ extinction speed was not decreasing, but rather increasing. I couldn’t see the bottom of his strength. </p>
<p>(Master?)</p>
<p>『No, it’s nothing.』</p>
<p> It seemed that he had shivered before he had realized it. I could feel his human senses wavered. The fear and uneasiness that welled up. After this, we had to meet and talk to that monster. What would happen if that power was directed at Fran? What would happen if that power was directed at Fran? The fact that she was not a person I could trust from a position or a mind made me feel more uneasy than necessary.  But I was not an enemy now. Rather than worrying about the future, I’d rather watch the battle of Trismegistus with my own eyes. As I was desperately chasing after the high-speed battle, I noticed the changes that were starting to occur on Trismegistus.  </p>
<p>『Her vitality is decreasing...?』</p>
<p>「Surely.」</p>
<p>  Fran heard me muttering and stared at Trismegistus with a relieved look on her face. It wasn’t my imagination after all.  Small wounds had pierced Trismegistus’ entire body, and he was clearly starting to take damage. </p>
<p>「Miss Hilt, what’s wrong?」</p>
<p>「Trismegistus, I’m getting blood even though I didn’t get hit」</p>
<p>「Aah, is that so?」</p>
<p> When I heard Fran’s mutter, Isario turned his eyes to the golden dragonkin and told me about his miserable circumstances.  </p>
<p>「You’re constantly moving like that with all your might.  Trismegistus’ body is under a terrifying burden. That’s enough to kill his life」</p>
<p>  He was using Divine Dragon Form and continuing to move as fast as he could.  Well, it seems he wasn’t going to be unscathed. I guess it’s like Fran using Brilliant Lightning Rush and Potential Release to fight with all her might.  </p>
<p>「Are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Don’t worry. If we don’t do something, we’ll die」</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>「It’s called immortal, but it’s a little different.  To be more precise, it’s resurrected when someone is on the verge of death.  It’s between the thrones. It’s the curse of immortality that he placed on me.」</p>
<p>  He cannot leave the castle’s grounds, and if he doesn’t kill the antidemons, he will be in endless intense pain.  Even if he dies, he will be resurrected and forced to fight. This was the true nature of the curse placed on Trismegistus.  By taking advantage of the fact that he could be resurrected even if he dies, he will use his strengthening skills that could self-destruct due to exhaustion. That was the secret of Trismegistus’ strength. In fact, he must do that every day to defeat that many antidemons.  Fran had a annoyed expression on her face, while I was trembling at the sight of Trismegistus’ strength.  </p>
<p>『Fran.  What’s wrong?』</p>
<p>「...... Nn.」</p>
<p> Was the emotion on Fran’s face a pity?  Come to think of it, Trismegistus was like being enslaved by a God. If they don’t feel that he was a great sinner who had destroyed the world, they may be empathetic. I was a little back to the harshness of the story of how they have to be resurrected and continued to fight for eternity without being able to leave the castle. Living in a luxurious castle would not be a comfort for them.  </p>
<p>「Hmm」</p>
<p>『Juanaverta shines, huh?』</p>
<p>  Falcion’s Juanaverta, who seemed to be an Intelligence Weapon, emitted a silver light at her blade.  It seemed that she could release magic power and stretch her blade. The sharpness of the blade was at the level of cutting antidemons like a trial slice of straw.  In terms of simplicity, I might have lost.  Was it its original performance? Or was it the effect of Trismegistus’ magic power? Anyways, it seemed to have something befitting for being the strongest dragonkin’s beloved sword.  Isario noticed that Fran was staring at Juanaverta. Then Isario opened his mouth.  </p>
<p>「Miss Hilt...  Are you interested in Trismegistus’ sword?」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>「I see. Then I’ll give you one piece of advice」</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>「Trismegistus shakes when it comes to that sword.  He’s not interested in others―― In other words, he won’t blame us for anything we do. Trismegistus was the only sword he had, and his partner, the Silver Falcion. Anyone was interested.  Some even tried to analyze his sword or take it away. He sometimes tried to forgive them without reproaching them, and other times he even twisted his head just to ask for a touch.  But even then, he didn’t look angry.  It was because he just needed to kill them.  Someone had told him to kill them.  So, he killed them. But it looked like that.  </p>
<p>「It’s not simply anger at me for this. It’s only when the sword is intertwined that I don’t know where the mines are」</p>
<p>『Well, that’s terrifying』</p>
<p>(Nn)</p>
<p>  A Transcender who was continuously destroying the high-ranking antidemons in front of us suddenly came to kill us? It must be a nightmare.  </p>
<p>「So, if you feel something is off, run right away. No matter what you do, you’ll be in trouble.」</p>
<p>「Okay.」</p>
<p>  Fran nodded, but was it okay to continue talking to Trismegistus in the first place? We came to see Juanaverta because we wanted to get some clues that might prevent me from going crazy.  But it would be a total waste of time if Fran’s life was in danger.</p>
<p>(I’ll definitely listen!)</p>
