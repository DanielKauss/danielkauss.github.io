</div><h1>Chapter 1055</h1><p>The admiral summoned Fran in front of her, as well as the trembling knights and sorcerers. They would have to be restrained first. The knights seemed to be obeying if they ordered her to kneel, but the admiral needed to take over the knights. However, even though she raged wildly, Fran’s anger still hadn’t quelled. Before she could tell her not to resist or be calm, she unleashed a slash without any further talk. </p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Gyaaaaaaahhh!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>『Eh? Wai, Fran?』</p>
<p> Wai, Fran?』</p>
<p>(First, we need to understand the hierarchical relationship)</p>
<p>  Fran didn’t seem to have any intention of interrogation.  The three men, who had lost their knees, screamed in a slightly pitiful way and echoed through the deck of the water dragonkin. However, Fran did not move her eyebrows and opened her mouth.  </p>
<p>「Are you from the Kingdom of Raidos?」</p>
<p>「Haiii!  It hurts!  It hurts! W-Who are you!?」</p>
<p>「Aghaah!  Shit! I couldn’t react at all!」</p>
<p>「Haaaah! Why am I in this mess!」</p>
<p>  I don’t think they’re in a state where they can listen to her...  But Fran is merciless.  After pouring water on the three of them with magic, she lightly pressures them.  Then, she opened her mouth again with a cold expression on her face.  </p>
<p>「Are you guys from the Kingdom of Raidos? Answer me」</p>
<p>「Shut up and noisy, yeah!  I-Don’t think you can do something like this for free! Hmm, forgive me!」</p>
<p>「Hmph」</p>
<p>「Guh!」</p>
<p>「Ghuh!」</p>
<p>「Ghuh! W-Why are we here...!?」</p>
<p>「Liability!」</p>
<p>  The three of them broke their hips and panted as Fran hit them in the stomach. Now they could tell that Fran was quietly raging.  </p>
<p>「I-I’m just a bodyguard! Ku-I don’t know the details of the country!」</p>
<p>「But the Chancellor was talking about something」</p>
<p>「Wha!  You can hear her...!」</p>
<p>「The Chancellor is an important person, right?  He’s so important that you can talk to her, right? She doesn’t even know anything about him, right?」</p>
<p>「Gyaaaah!」</p>
<p>「I’ll feel hurt if I tell a lie」</p>
<p>  Fran then kicked the wound of the magician’s man.  After the tremendous pain, the magician’s man cried in tears. At this point, the magician’s heart was completely broken. The small, fat admiral was still glaring at us with his eyes filled with hostility towards the magician whose eyes had died.  He was an asshole, but his level was over 30. And it was not a power leveling skill, but it was just the right strength for him.  He seemed to be more resistant to pain than magicians. Well, that doesn’t mean he can do something to Fran though. In the first place, since an admiral is not a pure fighter, his status is still low.  </p>
<p>「G-Girl!  Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaah!」</p>
<p>  As Fran approached the admiral, who was about to reluctantly summon her, she trampled on his wound. She trampled through the cut section of his leg.  The admiral twisted himself and tried to escape, but in front of Fran’s power, he didn’t have any resistance. Rather, he was widening his wound on his own, which increased the pain he felt.  </p>
<p>「―― Aaaah!」</p>
<p>「Are you guys from Raydoss?」</p>
<p>  The knight’s man answered the question three times. He must have realized that there was no way he could save himself as long as he didn’t answer the question no matter what.  </p>
<p>「Y-you’re right.  I’ll answer your question!  So don’t kill me――Gyaaah!」</p>
<p>「Don’t tell me what’s unnecessary」</p>
<p>「O-okay!  I understand, so please get out of your way!」</p>
<p>「Can you get out of here?」</p>
<p>「Hmph.」</p>
<p>  With this, the knight’s man’s heart would be completely broken.  His eyes were dominated by strong fear. Fran could only move with a jerk.  The half-dead admiral finally calmed down when she saw the knight in tears as he blew up a bubble. He must have finally understood that the angry girl in front of him was holding the right to life and death. After that, the conversation went very smoothly.  After all, this fleet was part of the Raidos Kingdom, and half of them were the ships and personnel of the Seedran Sea Kingdom. The Raidos Kingdom, which had taken Seedran under its command, seemed to have turned rebellious citizens, soldiers, and royalty into illegal slaves and used them as a single-use force. The barrier for the water dragonkin had been strengthened not only as a result of the modification by an alchemist from the Raidos Kingdom but also because of Marl’s skills.  The damage transfer phenomenon was also due to Marl’s skills. It seemed that admiral-type jobs have skills that affect the ship in various ways.  Incidentally, the job of the small, fat admiral is said to be a Stealth Admiral, and can give a concealment effect to the fleet under his command. That must have made her closer to Barbra without being noticed.  She was apparently one of the top-ranking naval forces of the Western Duke of the Raidos Kingdom. He was also involved in a mission to cause and confuse the Seedran Sea Kingdom. And they didn’t know the specifics of Marl’s body, which was the most important thing.  All they knew was that he had been implanted with a magic stone implantation technique and a super-humanization technique to synthesize materials from other races and magic beasts. The person who had received the technique was said to be mentally unstable. However, they had probably been forced under control by the slave’s collar. He seemed to have been able to control it well up until the middle of the treatment, but for some reason, the magic stone went out of control, and the slave’s body mutated, making the slave no longer work.  </p>
<p>「Hmph」</p>
<p>「Gwah!  W-how...!?」</p>
<p>  The admiral, who had suddenly been struck in the face, was probably frustrated by the pig’s explanation of the high level of the implantation technique he had proudly performed in Marl and the greatness of Raydoss. The admiral, who was suddenly struck in the face, was surprised, his eyes widened in confusion.  </p>
<p>「Kinda...」</p>
<p>「...!」</p>
<p> Now we know about Marl’s identity. But why did he want to go after Barbra?  The details were predictable.  The Kingdom of Raydoss invaded the Kingdom of Kranzel in order to end their long-term relationship. Their strategy was to attack Barbra and build a bridgehead between them.  The Kranzel Kingdom should have had a navy as well, but it was defeated in the sea battle near the port town of Dards, and it was already destroyed. Also, the disturbance since last year still has a break in the security. And the fact that it had obeyed the Seedran Sea Kingdom also increased its value as a supply base.On her way back from Gordisia, she encountered a battleship of the Kingdom of Raidos for the same reason.  However, the other one was not fighting against Kranzel, but against the Kingdom of Belios.  Because of the Commitment for Gordisia, she could not directly invade the Kingdom of Belios.  Therefore, she had launched a military action targeting the trading ports of food importers, which was important to the Kingdom of Belios. They must have been trying to indirectly cause chaos in Belios. In addition, they seemed to be trying to put pressure on Belios by taking in the neighboring countries of Belios as well.  And just as the period covered by the Gordician Duty was over, they planned to attack at once. The situation had already been settled on the small countries, and the strategy was quite advanced.  We asked them for more details. The King of Raydoss had just changed, and I’ve heard that the dukes of the North, South, East, and West are doing as they please.  This war was also led by the Eastern and Southern Dukes, and the Western Dukes are helping out. Well, it seems that the fleet we destroyed was under the Western Duke. The Southern Duke invaded the northern border of Kranzel to draw their attention, and the Western Duke was planning to invade the western part of Kranzel from Barbra, which is in the south west.  On the other hand, if the Kranzel Kingdom allocates its forces to Barbra, the north will be less developed, and the Southern Duke will have an advantage.On the other hand, if the Kranzel Kingdom allocates its forces to Barbra, the north will be weaker, and the Southern Duke will have the advantage.  Either way, the Raidos Kingdom, which took the lead, would have the advantage.  </p>
<p>『We’re short of luck after all』</p>
<p>(Nn)</p>
<p>  If the opponent is the Raidos Kingdom, the powerful people in the country will all head north.  Adventurers are not obliged to participate in war, but unless they are dealing with the Raidos Kingdom.  After all, it is a country that does not like strong adventurers. If Kranzel loses, the lives of the adventurers will change.  Not all of them will go north, but the number of adventurers will be reduced. Marl will be the one to deal with the remaining few.  With Marl’s fighting prowess, the battle against Rank B adventurers should be more equal.  Raidos’s people would be able to win with their help.  If they were in a state of outburst, they might be able to compete with Rank A adventurers. Well, it’s also based on the assumption that we’re close to the water’s shores, such as the sea and rivers.  We thoroughly hit Barbra with our fleet, including the water dragonkin, and then conquered it with our landing troops, including Marl.The fleet, including the water dragonkin, thoroughly struck Barbra, and the landing troops, including Marl, conquered it all at once.  That was Raydoss’s strategy, but it seemed that we had appeared before they landed. Anyway, we had most of the questions we wanted to ask them.  </p>
<p>『Fran.  Let’s hand them over to Barbra』</p>
<p>(... Nn)</p>
<p>  Fran probably managed to hurt them to some extent and reduce their drinking habit by using recovery magic. The old Fran might have killed him by treating him as if he had nothing to do.  I wrapped him in a magic thread and restrained him. Fran was holding the tip of the string, and her legs had not yet regenerated, so it would be impossible to escape.  Looking around, most of the ships in the Raidos Kingdom except the Water Dragon ship had been sunk.  Also, more than half of the ships that had not sunk were still in danger. Some of the ships were still holding the flag of the Seedran Sea Kingdom, but their masts and oars had been destroyed, making them impossible to sail. They might be able to use magic tools to move, but they didn’t seem to have the courage to escape while the giant wolf was watching over them.  </p>
<p>『Urushi, we’re going down to Barbra.Finally, Fran shouted loudly.  She must have purposely told the rest of the ship that she was on.Finally, Fran shouted loudly. She must have purposely told the rest of the ship that she was on. Just like Urushi’s answer, I felt like I heard some kind of scream.</p>
