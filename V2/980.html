</div><h1>Chapter 980</h1><p>The provoked dragonkin――No, they were all angry from the start because the boiling point was too low, but they attacked Isario with unusually low anger. Their behavior was very weak, but their fighting power was quite impressive. All of the ten dragonkin were on par with Rank C adventurers. Their leader and those standing next to them looked even stronger. If they were only for their strength, they would probably even exceed the top adventurers in the tournament. On the other hand, their equipment was not very strong. Many of the dragonkin here were heavy equipment because they were originally proud of their scales. However, it was not like the equipment of the dragonkin in front of them was worn by skilled warriors. If they were an adventurer, they would probably be equipped by someone of Rank D or E or higher. The weapons they held were not strong enough to be of any rank.  Some of them were as fast as lower echelons, and some didn’t even look like elites. That made them a force to be reckoned with.  However, no matter what kind of opponent they were facing, they were not enemies with Isario. Even if he was still exhausted, he could not imagine that Isario would lose. The only reason Fran seemed worried was not because she was worried about the win or the loss, but because she was worried that Isario might get exhausted again.  </p>
<p>「Uoooooooh!」</p>
<p>「Die!」</p>
<p>「Hahaha, that’s not nearly enough to kill her, is it?」</p>
<p>「Damn!」</p>
<p>「Dorya!」</p>
<p>「It’s so big that they yawn.」</p>
<p>  Isario continued to dodge the dragonkin’s attacks, provoking them to no avail. The dragonkin were already in Isario’s middle of it.  They had too much blood in their heads to notice at all, but I could see that the surrounding temperature was gradually rising. It would be too late if they felt something strange. Sure enough, after about five minutes, the dragonkin were too entangled to move. The leader of the group, in particular, was still trying to fight in his hula state.  </p>
<p>「Gubuh...... Urugaaah!」</p>
<p>「Oi oi, you’re being reckless, aren’t you?」</p>
<p>「Graaah!」</p>
<p>  He spat gastric juice from his mouth, but still did not stop. His eyes were clearly gone of sanity.  In this state, I could clearly see a hint of dread.  That’s the dragonkin we captured in the basement of Sendia. When the evil crystals were about to be destroyed, he showed a strange madness, but I could sense something close to them. They seemed to be being brainwashed by the Dragon King’s Dragon Domination skill.  Isario must have intended to capture the dragonkin and interrogate them. However, every dragonkin restraint did not stop them from rampaging.  Magic and life force kept dwindling, and eventually, all of the dragonkin were dead. They must have been mentally manipulated to rampage to their death. </p>
<p>「Uwaah, sorry.  I was just trying to get the info out of them.」</p>
<p> Isario looked apologetic, but everyone ended up with the same results.  </p>
<p>「No, that’s not bad.  I guess they were under some kind of manipulation.」</p>
<p>「You think so too?  The dragonkin tended to look down on other races more or less, but they’re terrible. They’re stupid inferior beings after all.」</p>
<p>「They didn’t seem to know anything about the Red lotus Blade-dono.」</p>
<p>「Uncle, he’s still famous after all」</p>
<p>  Isario seemed to feel that the dragonkin were not normal. Well, it was also terrible from our point of view. Frederick thought to himself as he stared at the corpse of the dragonkin.  </p>
<p>「Dragon big brother, what’s wrong?」</p>
<p>「These dragonkin have a lot to do with him.  He must have been a lower-ranked soldier in the northern reservations.」</p>
<p>「...... Is that a lower-ranked soldier? Seriously?」</p>
<p>「Yes.」</p>
<p>  Isario looked surprised. He was a low-ranked warrior at that level?  Even though he was as strong as a high-ranking adventurer? But it was certainly understandable if he said that his equipment was low-ranked.  Then Frederick called Fran, Isario, and Shiki. Apparently, there were other stories that he didn’t want to be asked about.  </p>
<p>「...Maybe they used the Sacrament of the Dragon God.」</p>
<p>「Absolutely.  It’s a magic potion developed by Trismegistus a long time ago that greatly increases the abilities of dragonkin. It was also thanks to that potion that I was able to take this body」</p>
<p>「Wasn’t it the ability of a half evil dragonkin?」</p>
<p>「That’s also true. To be more precise, the fact that you have taken the Sacrament of the Dragon God and became stronger has strengthened your abilities and allowed you to take in more evil energy」</p>
<p>「I see. That potion sounds troublesome」</p>
<p>「Yeah, it has strong side effects though.」</p>
<p>  Apparently, it was a forbidden medicine passed down to only a small part of the dragonkin.  Only priestesses knew how to make it, and even their ownership was strictly limited.  The effect was to stimulate the dragon’s cells passed down to the dragonkin, and to permanently amplify their abilities. They give the dragonkin their permanent strength if they take it, rather than temporary.  That’s a tremendous potion for the dragonkin. They can get stronger even though they haven’t leveled up.  However, the side effects were also tremendous.  First of all, they had a lot of refusal to allow their body to be transformed, and half of them died right after they took it. In other words, when they took the medicine, 75% of them died. I knew that it was a miracle that Frederick was still here alive. </p>
<p>「This information is not very upright, so I’d like you to refrain from talking about it if you can.」</p>
<p>「Okay.」</p>
<p>「Of course I do.  But are they originally low-ranked warriors?  Are they capable of withstood the side effects?」</p>
<p>「Oh?  Then why don’t you feel free to use them more casually?」</p>
<p>「That way, you can greatly reduce their life expectancy.」</p>
<p>  The Sacrament of the Dragon God is a liquid about the size of a squire. The strengthening can be activated by swallowing it down.  So, what happens if I drink a few drops of it? After about half as much strengthening as the original, there is no need to die instantly. That’s the best result if I ask that many questions.  However, there was a trap hidden there.  By staying half-heartedly enhanced, the burden on the un-enhanced parts increases by tens of times, and as a result, they reduce their life expectancy. And at the most, they lose their lives within ten days.  The reason why the dragonkin who fought Isario lost their lives must be the result of ignoring the burden and continuing to give it their all.Isario’s voice seemed to have more killing intent than ever before.</p>
