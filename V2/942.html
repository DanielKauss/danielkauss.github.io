</div><h1>Chapter 942</h1><p>The evening of the day Fran and Urushi arrived in Brutori, an army of antidemons finally appeared. The black swarm that covered the plains was a scene we had already seen. Unlike the people in the town who looked somewhat frightened, Fran and I were more relaxed than ever. This time there were already three divine swordsmen. It was more difficult to worry about the damage caused by the antidemons. Fran, looking down at the plains from the top of the walls, was slightly unhappy. She asked me while gritting her skewers. She asked me while chewing on a skewer.  </p>
<p>(Can’t we just leave it out there?)</p>
<p>『We can’t.  What if we get caught up in the attack of the divine sword. Besides, we don’t want to fight against a big country like this.』</p>
<p>(Muh.)</p>
<p>  I told Fran that I couldn’t do anything. Fran also knew that, but if the battle started in front of her, she would be in trouble.  </p>
<p>「Addle is coming out」</p>
<p>『Hmmm, I still don’t see him as the wielder of the Divine Sword.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>  Even at a distance, I saw Adr walking at the head of the holy knights deploying their troops. He had a relaxed gait and a smile on his face, with no fear or worry.  He was truly strong.  However, no matter how hard we tried to explore his strength, I didn’t think he was worthy to be the wielder of the divine sword. I could make excuses if we meet her out of nowhere on the battlefield, but now she’s completely on our side. We’d have no choice but to watch the battle and find out for sure.  </p>
<p>「That’s the Blade of Origin, Alpha」</p>
<p>『I-isn’t it pretty cool』</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>  That’s a lie. It’s super cool.  The color was pure white.  From the sheath to the blade, everything was white.  There was nothing that could be called a brim, and the lower part of the blade was split into two legs and stretched to the side like an Y-shaped. It was probably what acted as a brim.  Silver metal was used to give it a detailed decoration and a rainbow sheen on some of it. It was not just a simple sword at first glance. I could tell that it was a long sword in size, but I wonder if the blade was a little wider and wider.  Just as it was pulled out of the sheath, I could already feel an enormous amount of magic power swirling around it. In fact, I could even feel a faint divine attribute.  Adoll held up her Blade of Origin, Alpha, high in the air and turned its tip to the sky. When handsome guy did it, it was a very pictorial pose.  </p>
<p>「Divine Sword Release!」</p>
<p>  It was so simple to use. I wondered if it would be even more taxing, but from the start, she released her Divine Sword. With Adoru’s shouts, the Blade of Origin, Alpha, began to shine.  The white light rising from the wilderness was an expression of Divine Power radiating from Adoru and his Divine Sword.  Even we, here, could feel its tremendous power. The holy knights in front of us were probably going to get blown away if we didn’t physically hold on to it.  But that was a well-trained holy knight. All of them had their swords stuck in the ground, standing on their knees in a position similar to that of the King. In major powers, it would be unforgivable for them to show a disgusting appearance due to the power of their divine swords.  Then, a few seconds later, when the torrent of divine power subsided, there was a completely different appearance of Adorr.  It looked almost the same.  The divine sword was the same as it was before the opening, and Adorr’s equipment was the same. The only change was the thin light of magic power that covered her body.  However, the power emitted was that of a different person. </p>
<p>「She’s strong...!」</p>
<p>『Yeah.  Is that really Ader?』</p>
<p>  It was not just a matter of increasing her stats.  I could tell by the way she stood there with her sword.  Ader was now at the level of the Sword King. Her skills had clearly evolved.  That’s when I remembered the Alpha’s abilities I had heard before.  According to her, the oldest and most fearsome. He gave his wielder the skill, Half-Divine, and strengthened it.  All of his stats have increased ten times, his eyes were now tens of thousands of meters, he could see through any kind of concealment.  He could hear everything in the country. It was the ability to listen to the entire country.  In addition to that, all their skills were said to be at the highest level.  What’s important is the fact that all of their skills will be at the highest level. That was the kind of monster that would be born.  The man standing there――Adr Yaresfeim.  Well, I didn’t think he was strong.  Most of his skills were at a low level. His stats must have been quite high because of his high level.  That’s why I didn’t think he was weak. However, with almost no skill additions, she looked like she was in front of a power leveled opponent.  </p>
<p>『She’s moving!』</p>
<p>「She’s fast!」</p>
<p>  Addle suddenly teleported.  No, she dashed forward. With max speed without any preliminary movement, even we were unable to catch up for a moment.  Our slash came from a super-fast movement without a shadow.  That destroyed the antidemon’s vanguard. With just one swing, nearly 500 antidemons would have been split up and down, and disappeared. Fran would be faster at maximum speed when she transformed into a Divine Beast.  However, the rest of her ability was completely superior to hers.  She also had a number of high-level skills and had mastered them. That was what it took to move at super high speed without any preliminary movement.  What was even more terrifying about this guy was that he could maintain this state for a long time. Diaz also said that he could maintain his freedom for up to half a day.  Simply speaking, Ashwrath’s fighting power may be higher when he’s freed from Gaia. However, Alpha, who can fight for an extended period of time without going out of control, is more troublesome during hostile times.</p>
