</div><h1>Chapter 999</h1><p>After recovering from the neutralizing Velmeria, Fran and Urushi attacked Tilanaria.</p>
<p>Even though he was enhanced, his Divine Dragon Form was not activated. If we were now in his current state, it would have been an instant kill.</p>
<p>Like Velmeria, he managed to inflict some damage and then tightly blocked his movements with land magic.</p>
<p>「Urushi, keep an eye on them!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Now all that remains is the Dragon King Georg.</p>
<p>But――</p>
<p>「Grooaah!」</p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>The battle between Georg and Isario was so fierce.</p>
<p>He was a world-class adventurer who used teleportation to move at high speeds, scattered flames and continued to defend himself.</p>
<p>If we got closer, we would either be torn apart by the aftermath of Georg’s god-speed, or our bodies would be turned into charcoal by Ignis’ fire heat.</p>
<p>There was such a hell there that we even had to be prepared to die.</p>
<p>『Georg’s strength is... too extraordinary』</p>
<p>Compared to Velmeria, who was in the same Divine Dragon Form state, this one was on a different level. Maybe its original performance was on a different level?</p>
<p>No matter how hard we intervened, we couldn’t even find that chance.</p>
<p>But over time, I wouldn’t be able to maintain my Divine Dragon Form. My durability value was starting to decrease.</p>
<p>Since I was not a dragonkin, I was not able to use my full power. Because of this, the backlash was weaker than usual. I wouldn’t be able to maintain that power for long, even if that was the case.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Divine Dragon Form, the manipulation of the Divine Attribute has been greatly improved. Now, we can unleash a blow with the Divine Attribute more than ever before...</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>Fran was building up her strength without moving at all. She was just quietly bracing herself, looking for an opening to break into.</p>
<p>『Robe bastard is...』</p>
<p>She still didn’t move. Even after Velmeria and Tilanaria were captured, she showed no signs of slowing down or trying to save them.</p>
<p>We considered going for an attack, but it would be pretty bad if we got a bushes snake. We’ll have to take down Georg while he ignored us.</p>
<p>『Fran, how is it?』</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>Apparently, she was trying to figure out Georg’s movements. And she was trying to get a feel for it.</p>
<p>One blow would be enough to break our balance. Isario wouldn’t miss that chance.</p>
<p>However, Fran wanted to perfect one of the few opportunities she had.</p>
<p>(Master)</p>
<p>『Can you go?』</p>
<p>(Not yet. Otherwise, I can tell Isario about Master?)</p>
<p>『Hmm? You mean you’re exposing my identity?』</p>
<p>(Nn. Master, tell Isario about your strategy by telepathy)</p>
<p>『Oh, I see.』</p>
<p>Fran wanted to concentrate even more on this. She seemed to be planning to divert even the slightest word to attack.</p>
<p>(Isario wouldn’t mind teaching me about Master)</p>
<p>『...Yeah. If it were Isario, I might be okay to reveal it to him』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p>A momentary delay in timing may cause a fatal outcome. We should still try to time our timing with telepathy here.</p>
<p>I could hide my true identity, but it was better to reveal my true identity and gain trust here. Fran seemed to think so. Well, I guess she also wanted to keep her secret from Isario, whom she liked.</p>
<p>However, I couldn’t just surprise him by suddenly calling out to him. I think Isario would be fine, but I guess, in the unlikely event that I should.</p>
<p>Fran stepped forward a little without concealing her presence. That was enough to catch both Isario and Georg at the edge of their consciousness.</p>
<p>Then I raised my voice even further.</p>
<p>「Isario! You may be surprised now, but don’t be surprised!」</p>
<p>Maybe they could say something more? However, I could see Isario nodded lightly in response. It seemed that they knew that Fran was trying to intervene in some way.</p>
<p>After a short pause, I called out to him quietly.</p>
<p>『Isario. Can you hear me?』</p>
<p>(Hmm? A man?)</p>
<p>『That’s right. I’m Master. Well, don’t worry about the names since I’ll give you a thumbs-up in time. Oh, answer me is good. I’ll talk one-sidedly, so focus on the fight』</p>
<p>Isario seemed to be slightly flustered, but it didn’t seem to have had a significant effect on the battle. Okay, I wonder if I could do something about it.</p>
<p>『I’m on your side. But it’s hard to believe, so I’ll reveal my identity. I’m an intelligence weapon, the sword Fran was equipped with』</p>
<p>(Huh? Oops!)</p>
<p>『I know it’s hard to believe, but I want you to believe it now』</p>
<p>Isario glanced at Fran. However, Fran had already started to concentrate and could not afford to return the reaction to his gesture.</p>
<p>I had no choice but to transform my decorative string into the shape of a hand and returned a thumbs-up. So, she must have understood.</p>
<p>(Seriously?)</p>
<p>『Seriously. Then, Fran will go for one shot. Please sync it up』</p>
<p>(...I understand)</p>
<p>Alright, all that remains now is for Fran to land a blow on Georg.</p>
<p>Fran was still focused. Her concentration was so deep and heavy that she could not even feel the presence of her surroundings.</p>
<p>She even closed her eyes and completely went inside of herself. Shouldn’t we just look at Georg now?</p>
<p>But if I speak up now, it might interfere with Fran’s concentration. The only thing I could do was to trust Fran, wait, and protect her.</p>
