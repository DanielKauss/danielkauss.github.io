</div><h1>Chapter 973</h1><p>The giant-type that raged in the town of Sholts had a different shape from the giant-type from the sate.</p>
<p>「Something’s thorns.」</p>
<p>『Besides, the balance of limbs is quite different too』</p>
<p>The giant-type of the sate was a flickering chimpanzee-type, while the giant-type of the shoulde looked like a macho in armor with spines.</p>
<p>His arms and legs were thick, clearly higher in power, and he was clearly taller. There were so many differences in height that I could tell clearly what he was.</p>
<p>They differ depending on the giant type? No, they did grow up too.</p>
<p>If they were like babies before moving, they might grow by the magic power they absorb. And since this town was larger than Saate, it was more people and could absorb a greater amount of magic power.</p>
<p>When I thought about it as a result, I understood the difference from sate.</p>
<p>「Isario, what should we do?」</p>
<p>「Just like when we’re on a mission, we have to send him out of town. Miss Hilt, can you play the decoy again?」</p>
<p>「Leave it to me」</p>
<p>Isario didn’t hesitate to give Fran a dangerous role. The adventurers around him were not against it either.</p>
<p>So, this meant that Fran was fully recognized as one of the senior adventurers. Fran was happy to be on such a dangerous mission.</p>
<p>『Fran, you look stronger than the giant sate-types. Don’t let your guards down!』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>However, the method is the same.</p>
<p>Fran and Urushi provoked them from a distance, and the soldiers behind them attacked from outside the city walls with long-range attacks. They then led the giants into action and killed them all at once.</p>
<p>Having already experienced this once, the deployment of the second unit was quick.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the giant-type antidemons were near the wall. It would have taken them quite a while to lure them out of the city if they were to stay more in the center of town.</p>
<p>Once we were sure that the refugees from Satte were away enough, we started to move.</p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>「Woooof!」</p>
<p>Fran struck the giant-type with her intimidation skill, and Urushi provoked them with his roar skill. It didn’t seem to work on the big monsters, but we should be able to tell that they had hit us with their aggressive magic power.</p>
<p>「Ruoooogh!」</p>
<p>「I noticed them」</p>
<p>『Yeah, his personality seems to be quite belligerent』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>The giant-types that caught Fran and Urushi approached us as they stomped the town under their feet. Due to their large stride, they were faster than the sate giant-types.</p>
<p>『Urushi, be careful!』</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>They didn’t need to be attacked, simply chasing us at an even faster pace. At this rate, we should be able to guide them out of the city walls in about a dozen seconds.</p>
<p>They continued to provoke while paying attention to their outstretched hands, and in a few steps, the giant-type had reached the city wall.</p>
<p>「Ruuaaaaaaaaaahhh!」</p>
<p>「Crouching down?」</p>
<p>「Arf!」</p>
<p>『W-What?』</p>
<p>The giant-type suddenly broke its waist to the side. It slowed down, but it bent its hips skillfully and reached for its right hand to clamp its claws on the ground.</p>
<p>I had seen the giant-type moving like a telekinesis in my head, so I didn’t expect it to move this flexibly.</p>
<p>Sholt’s giant-type stood up and shook his right hand at our astonished eyes. His stance looked like that of a baseball throw. No, in fact, it was just a movement to throw something.</p>
<p>「Ruaaaah!」</p>
<p>『Ugh!』</p>
<p>Just like the sate, it threw rubble at us. But unlike the sate giant-type, which relied on brute force, this rubble was enveloped in dense magic power. I’m sure it was only a small difference in power.</p>
<p>Moreover, the speed of the blows was incomparable. I thought he had swung his arms down, but there were already countless rocks in front of us.</p>
<p>She quickly stowed away the rocks from the direct hit course and hit the surrounding rocks with telekinesis.</p>
<p>However, the telekinetic layer that I extended to focus on a wide area could not stop the rocks flying at high speed. The power of the rock had probably decreased somewhat, but most of the rocks flew through my telekinesis and flew behind us.</p>
<p>Fran and Urushi probably slammed down a few of them, but a maximum of ten of them. The shots of the rocks that the giants had thrown were pouring down on the soldiers in the back.</p>
<p>The rocky group that the giant-type of Sholts had thrown straight down from a height of more than 200 meters was meteor showering down on us.</p>
<p>I saw a few of the walls that you had created with Earth Magic blocked and shattered. Isario also seemed to have repelled them with his Divine Sword, but he hadn’t been able to prevent them all.</p>
<p>In the end, about ten rocks had thrust into the second unit, killing and wounding more than ten soldiers. Several soldiers were crushed and flying in the air like dead leaves.</p>
<p>「Ruuuuuu!」</p>
<p>『More incoming!』</p>
<p>「I’ll protect everyone, Urushi! At full speed!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>As for me, I think the best way would be to go back to the second unit and reinforce our defenses. However, Fran seemed to be trying to disrupt the attack itself.</p>
<p>Race: Ragnarok Wolf; Demon Wolf; Magic Beast</p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>「Grrrrr!」</p>
<p>『Kanna Kamui!』</p>
<p>My spell landed a direct hit on the giant arm, but it wasn’t enough to crush it. To my surprise, it seemed that it managed to reduce the damage by concentrating my magic power on my arm.</p>
<p>However, throwing had stopped in order to regenerate the damage. Then, Fran’s slash was unleashed from the back of Urushi, who was running at high speed.</p>
<p>Fran’s face scrunched up with a high-pitched sound as if metal was clashing with metal.</p>
<p>「I-Impossible!」</p>
<p>『Seriously!?』</p>
<p>Even if he didn’t use Sword God Transformation or Brilliant Lightning Rush, Urushi’s speed was still rising. That slash must have been quite powerful. In fact, more than half of the Sarte’s giant-shaped arms had been sliced open.</p>
<p>However, it seemed that the defenses of the giant-types that were concentrating their magic power were orders of magnitude greater. To my surprise, they were only able to cut through about a tenth of them.</p>
<p>「Urushi! One more time!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>We turned around Urushi as he passed us, but the giant-type arm was already beginning to swing down.</p>
<p>「Ruuwooogh!」</p>
<p>『This is bad! I can’t store it in that position!』</p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>「Grrrrr!」</p>
<p>The magic that Fran and her group had unleashed tried to hinder her movement was also blown away by her tough arms. Then, once again, the countless rocks in her palm were released at super high speed.</p>
<p>Towards the bottom.</p>
<p>With a tremendous roar, countless rocks were pierced under the feet of the giant. They failed to throw.</p>
<p>「Master, did you do something?」</p>
<p>『Yeah! Now with my telekinesis!』</p>
<p>All I did was wrap the giant’s hand with my telekinesis. The kneading was also lax, and I was able to hinder the giant’s movement for just a moment.</p>
<p>But that was enough.</p>
<p>When playing catch, I sometimes fail and throw a one-bound ball, or worse, I sometimes throw it straight down.</p>
<p>That was a failure that occurred when she didn’t let the ball go with her ideal release point and threw the ball farther ahead.</p>
<p>I activated my telekinesis to delay the timing of the giant’s hand opening for a moment, which caused my release points to go crazy.</p>
<p>I was worried about how effective the telekinetic blockage would be in the face of the giant-type scythes, but it was more impressive than I had imagined.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, I didn’t put unnecessary power into my fist when throwing something. In fact, it was important not to put unnecessary power into my fist. That was why even the wide telekinesis was able to interfere with the opening of my fist more than I had imagined.</p>
<p>Even without knowing what he had done, he probably thought Fran was in the way.</p>
<p>「Ruuuuh!」</p>
<p>『Look at me! It looks like I’ve been upgraded from a beetle to an enemy!』</p>
<p>「Just like I wished!」</p>
