</div><h1>Chapter 1081</h1><p>The rescue of the water dragon went more smoothly than I had imagined. I guess Marl’s presence within Fran relieved her of her sense of caution. She remained still as she cut through her chains and torso. It didn’t even take her five minutes to free the two, huh? It was discovered by a Raydoss soldier at the end of the end, but it was already too late. </p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Kyuooo!」</p>
<p> Two water dragons screamed and created a huge wave. As a result, both of the former water dragonkin were capsized, causing great damage. As a result, both of the former water dragonkin were capsized, causing great damage.  </p>
<p>「Master!  We can’t lose!」</p>
<p>  The raging water dragons were the force that would annihilate the Raidos fleet at this rate.  Seeing this, they must have panicked if they took all of their prey with them. Fran then jumped out in a hurry. </p>
<p>『I’m gonna include the water dragons in it, so thunder magic won’t work on it』</p>
<p>「Then I’ll cut you!」</p>
<p>『Got it!』</p>
<p> I transformed into my anti-ship mode and Fran, along with the water dragons, attacked the Raidos fleet.  The large ships were easily cut in half and then ignited by the attribute swords and sank. Some of them jumped out into the sea before sinking, but the surface of the sea was rough with the water dragon magic, and they drowned and quickly sank. Fran’s slashes and the water dragon’s breath sank the Raydoss fleet one after another, and in less than half an hour, the large fleet of the Raydoss Kingdom turned into sea debris.  There would be no survivors.  I was wondering if they had any special forces to counter the strong, but they didn’t come out. Just as I was thinking that, the water dragon emerged with something in its mouth.  </p>
<p>「Who is this guy?」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  It held out the body of a man in its armor. When I appraised him, I found that he was a demi-demon.  He was quite strong.  He was a high-ranking magician who controlled storm magic. His physical strength was not very great, but his magic power was probably equivalent to Rank A.  Moreover, he was a demigod like Valusa, so he should have high regenerative power.  Also, his armor was quite strong.  It was made of orichalcon with barriers and floating skills.  In addition, I could see that he was connected to the water dragonkin with magic power. I wonder if this guy was a special forces huh?  At sea, he would be much stronger than I had imagined.  However, thanks to Mar, the magic supply from the water dragonkin had stopped, and they suddenly sank the ship and hurriedly deployed. It seemed that the water dragons attacked and defeated us as we left the ship.  </p>
<p>『... This has cleared up the fleet』</p>
<p>「Next is the Kingdom of Shallus!」</p>
<p>『Well then, it looks like we’re going to destroy the Shallus Kingdom, right? Rather, it’s the ground troops of Raidos, which is going to invade from the Kingdom of Shallus』</p>
<p>「?Of Fran’s people, the Shallus Kingdom was treated as a friend of Raidos, and if that was the case, they might be the ones to be defeated.  However, if they attack us at the border without a request from the government, it would be clearly an international problem. intercepting them near the border would be tolerable.  </p>
<p>『But first, what should we do with the princesses?』</p>
<p>  They were unconscious now, but once they wake up, they would be controlled by the slave collar. In some cases, they would lose their mind and go on a rampage.  The only way to destroy the slave contract was to destroy it or overwrite it, but... The fact that it hadn’t been freed means that the water dragonkin probably didn’t store it.  </p>
<p>『Contract magic―― no good, huh?』</p>
<p>「Can’t you overwrite it?」</p>
<p>『Don’t get repelled. Someone with a higher skill level than me must be involved in the contract.』</p>
<p>「...... Let’s use your points to raise our level.」</p>
<p>『...... Okay.  That’s all I can say.』</p>
<p>  To Fran, the illegal slavers are her mortal enemies.  If she wants to save someone from such an enemy, Fran will do everything. To make Fran’s wishes come true, I’d have to earn some self-evolution points. </p>
<p>『First, let’s Kanst the contract magic.』</p>
<p>《Contract magic has reached LvMax.  Cursed magic Lv1 has been added to my skill. Fran has earned a title and a contract magician》</p>
<p> I got the arcane magic I heard about in the Belios Kingdom before. How about this?  I decided to try to use the arcane magic.  The same went for the contract magic, but I only have one technique that I can use.  </p>
<p>『Curse magic!』</p>
<p>  Then I could clearly interfere with the contract. Rather than overwriting it, it was more like rewriting a part of the contract.  Perhaps, if the other party was even lower in rank, I could completely destroy the contract. To be honest, we might not be able to reach that level yet, but I think I could go with it if I gave my best.  </p>
<p>『Activating the curse! I’ll destroy all of your deals!』</p>
<p>「Do my best, Master!」</p>
<p>『Ou!』</p>
<p>  There was a lot of backlash.  My durability and magic power were going to be greatly reduced.  Perhaps, a raw person would not have been able to survive due to the tremendous pain and haggling. If I hadn’t been careful, I would have died.  </p>
<p>『Doryaaaaah!』</p>
<p>「Oooh!  Master is amazing!」</p>
<p> As I endured the backlash and continued to use the curse magic, the princess’ collar shattered in a few dozen seconds, and her contract had all disappeared. If it hadn’t been me, I would have had to raise the level of my cursed magic even further.  </p>
<p>「Master!  I did it!  After all, Master is super cool!」</p>
<p>『O-ou!』</p>
<p>  Fran’s excitement was amazing.  The slave collar, which was a symbol of despair for her, twisted it head-on and destroyed it, my power seemed to be the light of hope. I should have remembered it earlier.  </p>
<p>『From now on, I can help the slaves a lot.</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
