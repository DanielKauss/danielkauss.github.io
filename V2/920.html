</div><h1>Chapter 920</h1><p>「Divine Beast Form!」</p>
<p> With those words, the divine power was blown up. At the same time, it was transformed into black lightning, wrapped around Fran and enveloped her. The black lightning that enveloped Fran’s surroundings looked like a black lotus bud. Inside the black bud that gave off a dull thud, the power swelled with terrifying momentum. A few moments later, when the black lightning burst and disappeared, Fran, who had acquired a new power, stood there. Divine Beast Form. That seemed to be the true nature of the power Fran had used――a skill. From the point of view of the word, it was probably a skill in the same system as the Dragonmen’s Divine Dragon Form. However, there was no significant change as Velmeria’s Divine Dragon Form.  It was just like her hair, claws, and fangs have grown a little longer.  There seemed to be no fur on her body. It was so plain for a scene like a magic girl’s makeover.  However, the only thing that was plain was her appearance. Anyone who could feel the vicious power swirling within her would be scolded for being so plain. It was not a matter of being flashy or anything like that.  The presence was overwhelmingly different. The atmosphere they exuded was that of a transcendent being, and the strength of the black lightning they wore was on a different level.  Black lightning, which was several times as strong as it used to be, was swirling and repelling around Fran. It was as if the incarnation of black lightning had taken shape and was standing there.  Their stats were also exceptional.  A Divine Beast had been added to the race, and they were now in a Divine Beast state. And it had over a thousand strength, over a thousand stamina, and over 2,000 agility and magic power.  It was just like in its original state. If he was further strengthened by his skills, his abilities would only improve.  </p>
<p>「Hmm?」</p>
<p>  Fran turned her palm to the antidemons to check something.  </p>
<p>「Hmm.」</p>
<p>『Whoa!』</p>
<p>  The moment Fran put some light energy into her hand, an extremely thick black lightning was suddenly emitted from her palm. It was probably about the thickness of a teleporter.  The black lightning continued forward about 20 meters, burning the air and antidemons, bursting and dissipating. There was an empty area created by the disappearance of a large number of antidemons. </p>
<p>「Ooh, amazing.」</p>
<p>『Ah, yes.  This is bad.』</p>
<p>  For Fran, it must have been as if she had put a light amount of energy into it. But with that, I could feel a tremendous amount of magic power moving.  Fran herself stared into her palm and was surprised.  However, she soon became serious. Fran thrusts her palm again.  This time, I could see that she was concentrating.  </p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p> With a short exhalation, even more magic power wriggled than before, and black lightning was fired. Black lightning, so thick that a human could swallow it easily, was raging around in the antidemon horde like a snake scurrying around.  </p>
<p>『Oooh!  Amazing...』</p>
<p>「Fufun」</p>
<p>  With just one blow, more than a hundred high-ranking antidemons would have disappeared.  It was just as powerful as the Black Lightning Advent, one of our secret techniques. However, unlike the Black Lightning Advent, which canceled her awakening when used, this attack was able to unleash a series of attacks.  Fran responded to my surprise with a somewhat serious look on her face. But the true value of Fran now was not just black lightning.  Next, Fran folded her knees lightly and braced herself. Next to her magic power, she was trying to test her physical abilities.  </p>
<p>「Fuuh!」</p>
<p>  Just by flying forward, the surrounding scenery flowed at an amazing speed. The black and red lines were probably the color of antidemons.  I hurriedly used my Space-time Magic. I accelerated my time even faster than before, and finally, I could recognize the view.  I had used self-acceleration before. But Fran was so fast that even I couldn’t keep up.  </p>
<p>「Oops!」</p>
<p>『O-okay, Fran!』</p>
<p>「Don’t worry.」</p>
<p>  It was so acceleration that even Fran herself misjudged the speed. She must have planned to move a little, but she had traveled nearly 50 meters and flicked away the antidemons that were in between with her body. Fran was not injured.  The magic power she wore was probably as thick as a barrier.  After defeating the antidemons with her hands, Fran nodded many times, making her hands gooey. It seemed that she had recognized her power exactly.  </p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>『You’ve become much stronger!』</p>
<p>「I can protect everyone with this!」</p>
<p>  Oh, that’s right.  I tried to hit the hammer, but I couldn’t make a voice. But instead, I could hear Announcer-san’s voice. </p>
<p>《The individual named Master’s name can now be changed temporarily》</p>
<p>  Eh?  Announcer-san?  What the hell?  </p>
<p>《King Wolf Sword, Fenrir――― The naming conditions have not been met.  His name will be discarded》</p>
<p>, what was going on? The King Wolf Sword, Fenrir, is a name that looks like a Divine Sword!Hey, just explain it to someone!</p>
