</div><h1>Chapter 1031</h1><p>Trismegistus said that his goal was to kill many people.</p>
<p>『You......!』</p>
<p>Even if I knew it was useless, I couldn’t control my anger. But Trismegistus didn’t react to my muttering that time.</p>
<p>『I’ll tell you which one is worse than you, who didn’t know anything and was just misjudged!』</p>
<p>Juanaverta shouted in a high-pitched voice.</p>
<p>『When Trismegistus-sama was pushed into that castle, there were only dragonkin and my Lord on this continent. There had been no significant increase in numbers for a while. It was a continent that was punished by the Gods, and they had told me that only those who could fight were allowed to enter in the first place』</p>
<p>『Only those who can fight against it? But...』</p>
<p>Many of the residents of Nocta seemed to be ordinary citizens. To think all of them were capable of fighting.</p>
<p>『Yeah! That’s right! There are many incompetent maggots on this continent that have no fighting power and can only feed on antidemons! Can you tell how much of a burden Trismegistus-sama is feeling?』</p>
<p>I was born several decades ago, it seems. Not that it means much to me considering how I don’t remember living that long myself.</p>
<p>The more people were eaten without defeating antidemons, the more powerful the Abyss Eater would be. I don’t know how much Trismegistus is draining the Abyss Eater’s power every day, but it seemed that its efficiency would definitely decrease.</p>
<p>Trismegistus and the dragonkin. It used to be better when there were only a few adventurers left, but now they looked completely different.</p>
<p>Trismegistus also seemed to have interfered with his own mission, and ordered them to leave the continent many times over.</p>
<p>However, most of the people living on this continent have nowhere else to go.</p>
<p>The residents of Gordicia were either those or their descendants who have escaped from other continents. And the circumstances of those who have escaped to this continent are unforgivable.</p>
<p>Take the criminals, for example. It is common sense in this world that criminals are often captured and enslaved. Just being in jail is not only a waste of money but also takes up a lot of space.</p>
<p>So, it would be obviously more efficient to enslave them for minor crimes. Besides, there would be advantages for the criminals too.</p>
<p>They were clearly guaranteed their rights, and treated completely differently from the slaves they had on Earth in the past.</p>
<p>It was kinda like prison work, and there was little chance that it would be used up or abused. It would be treated even better if it became a debt slave, and it would be a kind of job placement with a rather tight schedule.</p>
<p>As Fran’s partner, I have no good feelings about slaves. However, I understand that this was a necessary system for the return and effective use of light criminals.</p>
<p>On the other hand, they were also treated badly for serious crimes. For example, they had meat walls on the battlefield and an experimental table for dangerous new drugs. Also, they were not supposed to be a spectacle for killing each other.</p>
<p>It would be a waste to just let them kill me, and I’m willing to make effective use of it at the end of the fight.</p>
<p>And the same went for the punishment of “Sending slaves to Gordisia”. As the name implied, the punishment for sending slaves to Gordisia for fighting antidemons.</p>
<p>In other words, coming to this continent was like death for the average person.</p>
<p>In the midst of all this, what kind of people do they have come to this continent at their own will? One is the heavy criminals who came to this continent as places to escape, rather than being sent with shackles. Naturally, it is impossible for them to leave this continent because they were wanted by other continents and guilds.</p>
<p>There were also many political criminals, such as royalty and nobility of the destroyed country. After all, they were something that an invading country could never leave. If they were to be captured, they would be thrown in jail for the rest of their life or sent to death.</p>
<p>That’s why many of them fled to Gordisia. Also, in consideration for the people in the controlled areas, some countries sent captured enemy countries to Gordisia without using the death penalty. They wanted to say that it was better than the death penalty. So, they couldn’t leave the continent.</p>
<p>Moreover, their descendants had created towns and an increase in numbers. Because of this, many of the people on this continent were unable to fight. Many of the people born on this continent did not have family registers or foreign currency.</p>
<p>That’s why they couldn’t leave if they were suddenly told to do so. Many countries couldn’t help but take on the job in their own countries, so they didn’t actively support their retreat.</p>
<p>However, Trismegistus simply refused to allow him to do so. After all, the only thing that mattered to him right now was the completion of the mission given by the Gods.</p>
<p>The result was the current slaughter. For Trismegistus, this must have been a two-bird strategy that allowed him to create giant antidemons and thin out obstacles.</p>
<p>『Ahahahaha! It was all as Trismegistus-sama and I had hoped for! It has been a little worth it for my Lord’s sake!』</p>
<p>「My estimate is that if we could work together with our current forces, we would have no problem defeating the strengthening antidemons. I didn’t expect them to be destroyed before I joined in.」</p>
<p>After hearing those words, I suddenly became curious.</p>
<p>『...Why are you outside the castle?』</p>
<p>「If an antidemon is born in the underground part of the castle, the shackles will be temporarily removed in order to follow it. It’s even possible to enter the second barrier, though.」</p>
<p>『Is the second barrier that purple dome?』</p>
<p>「Indeed. That’s a device that the Gods have prepared for us to not let antidemons escape」</p>
<p>Apparently, this was not something Meritte had prepared, but something that came with it. So, she had misused it to try and lock up the dragonkin.</p>
<p>「Fran, Master. I’ll reward you.」</p>
<p>「Reward?」</p>
<p>Did she wait for Fran to reach me? As soon as Fran reached my hilt, Trismegistus said those words.</p>
<p>But why are we the only ones?</p>
<p>『O Lord! We don’t need such a thing for a reward!』</p>
<p>「A Divine Swordsman must fight against the pieces of the Evil Gods, not as a reward. Among the others, Fran and Master’s accomplishments were outstanding. I’d even say that they were just an act of reward」</p>
<p>I don’t really like him at all, but I can understand that he shouldn’t be reckless or lying. He’s just looking at him objectively and telling the truth.</p>
<p>Indeed, I was able to perform a comparable job among the Divine Sword users...... But I didn’t think that a reward or two would be decent.</p>
<p>『What does reward mean?』</p>
<p>「I’ll help you」</p>
<p>Trismegistus readied Juanaverta for some reason while saying that.</p>
