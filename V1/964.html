</div><h1>Chapter 964</h1><p>Fran and Isario had moved through the night to Nocta. Well, Fran slept on me along the way, so Isario was the only one who stayed all night.</p>
<p>At first, Urushi tried to do his best, but as expected, he seemed to have pushed himself too hard by moving to Brutori, and he soon got away. So, I decided to ride Fran on a telekinetic air ride and keep flying in the sky.</p>
<p>I’ve gotten strangely used to it as I was supporting Fran as she slept. Now I might be able to keep my futon on the top. This must mean that I’ve grown a lot.</p>
<p>Still, it was a challenge for us to keep up with Isario, but we managed to reach Nocta without being late.</p>
<p>Outside the town, there were still traces of fierce battles. Some areas had large depressions on the ground, and others had burns over a wide area. Some of the places had reddish-blackened blood.</p>
<p>Notes: I got an issue with my editor, he hasn’t done anything on his part for these past ten days, and this is the last chapter he has edited. He’s miraculously back! XD</p>
<p>As we approached the gate, we saw a group of adventurers gathered. They were apparently deploying to check the city walls and stay vigilant against antidemons.</p>
<p>There, I found the face of someone I knew.</p>
<p>「Zehard!」</p>
<p>「Young miss!」</p>
<p>「Nocta, were you okay?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, thanks to the dwarves and demonkin. Nadia-san is safe too. The phenomenon of her mana being sucked out couldn’t even reach that area.」</p>
<p>Mulsani’s escort adventurer, Zehard, told her about Nadia’s safety, but Fran relaxed her shoulders. She must have been worried about Nadia.</p>
<p>Even though she was exhausted, that was Nadia, a high-ranking adventurer. Even though she knew that she would not die from magic exhaustion, she was worried until she actually checked her safety.</p>
<p>「Isario! Fran! You’re safe!」</p>
<p>Now that Fran and Zehard had been separated, they were called on by Replare, the guildmaster who was in charge of the army.</p>
<p>「You too. Did you see any big monsters in Nocta?」</p>
<p>「Yes. Fortunately, we were able to defeat it with the help of dwarves and demonkin, but...... How bad is the damage to Brutori?」</p>
<p>「The town itself was still safe. However, some adventurers and residents were dead.」</p>
<p>「Yeah... The damage was not small either...」</p>
<p>Apparently in Nocta, Jayne, the Demon Queen, and Orfalve, the Dwarf Queen, took the lead in destroying all the antidemons.</p>
<p>The dwarves, in contrast to the antidemons gushing out from the encampment, magicians from the demonkin used their great ritual magic to weaken the huge antidemons. In the end, the two queens attacked the huge antidemons and destroyed them.</p>
<p>In Nocta, the impact of the Great Magic Beast had apparently exceeded that of Brutori due to the appearance of a giant antidemon right next to the town. The buildings and other stuff had been destroyed frequently, and the damage from that disaster had apparently been immeasurable.</p>
<p>「Currently, the damage situation in various places is gathering, but I heard that Sendia was almost immune to damage.」</p>
<p>「Is that so?」</p>
<p>Fran was probably the most curious about it. She bit into Replare’s words.</p>
<p>「Yeah. Now I’ve heard a report of the townspeople and the holy knights of Silard working together. The giant antidemons were defeated by the Beast King’s daughter and the Divine Sword Knight Adoll, you know?」</p>
<p>Or rather, I became aware of that report. Did they send Silard’s men on their way to Sendia? There was originally a promise between Filuria, the Medical Director, and Ader to hand her over.</p>
<p>The story of Sophie being a Divine Swordsman had spread throughout the town, and it was very likely that Adoll heard about her. If that was the case, then maybe they would use any hand to kidnap Sophie?</p>
<p>It seems that their stay in Sendia saved the town, but... Sophie and Rhyn were safe? Mea was a Divine Swordsman, and Velmeria had turned into Divine Dragons once. If Silard exposed her, she might be targeted for kidnapping.</p>
<p>「...I’m going to Sendia!」</p>
<p>「What’s wrong, girl? I heard that Sendia is safe?」</p>
<p>「Addle the Divine Sword Knight is targeting Sophie. She might try to take us by force.」</p>
<p>「That’s what she said」</p>
<p>Of course, I’ve told the Adventurers Guild about Filuria too. However, she must have been unaware of Filuria’s existence, since she was already the one who captured Seliadot at the Ward Dealer.</p>
<p>Since we made a fuzzy report about the Divine Sword, the guild’s still not fully aware of Sophie’s importance, which was a disadvantage for us.</p>
<p>They didn’t care much about whether the Holy Nation of Silard had gone to Sendia or not either.</p>
<p>「Maybe it’s just right then」</p>
<p>「What do you mean?」</p>
<p>「I was going to have you guys go to Sendia.」</p>
<p>「Is that so?」</p>
<p>「Yes. The administrative council of this continent has decided to send a request to all adventurers and the country to provide them with forces. The forces will be divided into several groups and defeated the remaining giant antidemons――the giant antidemons.」</p>
<p>Although she does not have any direct authority, the administrative council has the power to make requests in order to maintain the walls on this continent. Neither the government nor the guild have a duty to obey.</p>
<p>This was only because it was a request from the government. However, if the government refused, other countries would back us up, and they might even say that it was a default on its Gordician Duty.</p>
<p>There are forces that have no choice but to comply with the council’s requests.</p>
<p>「Of course, the Adventurers Guild will send urgent requests to all adventurers. You will be obeying too, right?」</p>
<p>「Well, that can’t be helped then」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>As an adventurer, I can’t refuse. In an emergency like this, it’s only natural.</p>
<p>「So, the administrative council would like to make sure that the Holy Nation of Silard, the Militant Nation of Hagane, the Snorabbit Kingdom of the Dwarves, and the Kingdom of Doom Demons participate too.」</p>
<p>Two countries possessed divine swords, and two countries had seven sages as kings. Naturally, they were the best forces in this continent.</p>
<p>「I have received a pleasant agreement from the Queen. The other branch will send a emissary to Militant Nation of Hagane. So, I’d like you all to go to Silard」</p>
<p>「Why do you want to go with us two?」</p>
<p>「To be honest, aren’t these idiots? And they only think about themselves after all. We have to negotiate with them arrogantly so that they can’t refuse after rolling around for various reasons, right?」</p>
<p>I guess they were intimidating Isario and Fran to force Silard’s participation in the battle.</p>
<p>If Isario were the only one, he would be evenly matched with Ader. The holy knight’s presence might give him an advantage, but Fran would only last for more than five minutes, so the other side wouldn’t want to go all out by force.</p>
<p>No ordinary country would dare to be that stupid, but Replare seemed to think so. She was a person who understood her evaluation of Silard.</p>
<p>If we take Silard to the battlefield here, we won’t have time to waste in Sendia, and the eyes of those around us will be on watch.</p>
<p>『I’ll have to shook Silard’s head!』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
