</div><h1>Chapter 945</h1><p>I had thought the antidemons had been annihilated by Adle, but the battle was not over yet. The information came from the other side of the gate that antidemons were starting to gather again. They hadn’t started moving yet, but they were expected to start moving in a few hours. It seems that they can predict the movements of antidemons in detail, but if they have been scouting on this continent for many years, they will be able to read the movements of antidemons somehow. I think it’s possible to predict the antidemons’ behavior in detail, but if you’ve been on this continent for many years, you will be able to predict the movements of antidemons.  There aren’t many more of them than before, but there’s nothing less than 10,000 of them.  I thought Isario’s role was here, but the Militant Nation of Hagane was the one to take care of it. We could also see a carriage behind the soldiers.  </p>
<p>「You won’t intercept us here?」</p>
<p>『I guess they’re going to do it on their own』</p>
<p> If there were too few enemies, the best way would be to deploy them near the wall, relying on the town’s support.  However, the soldiers of the Hagane army dashed away from the wall. If we could get any further away, we would not be able to cover for them, just like Silard.  Apparently, they don’t need any support.  Was it because they were going to use a divine sword after all? That’s why they tried to leave the town.  After all, Berserk was out of control. If they released their divine swords near the castle gate, they would destroy Brutori, who had come to defend them.  In fact, I’ve heard that there was such an incident a long time ago.  But what about those old soldiers?  If Berserk was used, they would be irrelevant to their enemy. But wouldn’t the soldiers get caught up in it at that time? While we were wondering, the troops of General Hagane were leaving one after another.  </p>
<p>「Master, let’s chase them」</p>
<p>『You’re right.  Urushi, we’ll count on you here.  Notify me if there is any movement』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  With Urushi’s legs and teleportation, even if we were a little farther away, we would be in an instant. </p>
<p>「Okay, let’s go.」</p>
<p>『Yeah!』</p>
<p> Leaving Urushi to watch over the town, we will watch the battle of Hagane from the sky.  After about 200 meters, we would be facing the antidemons. Once we stopped at the spot, the soldiers began to prepare for battle. Four women, including you, the Hydrangea, and the other one, came out of the carriage.  The woman we had never seen before looked just like you.  She might be a sister to us too. Judging from their attitude toward the hydrangea and the Pine Tree, the Hydrangea seemed to be in a higher position than us.  If you were their commander, the Hydrangea and Pine Tree were probably the wielders of the Divine Sword.If you were their commander, the hydrangea and maste‍r were probably the wielders of the divine sword.  The carriage they were riding seemed to have a special structure, with the stairs folded in the rear climbing up to the roof of the carriage.  When chairs were set up on top of it, it was as if we were sitting in a simple spectator seating.  The hydrangea and mastelier were sitting side by side in front of us.  The other woman standing behind them seemed to be a mere bodyguard.  As she approached the soldiers, she began to raise her voice. It seems that she will continue to fight antidemons with the soldiers.  </p>
<p>『Looks like she won’t use her divine sword, huh?』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p> I guess it’s possible they can’t use their divine swords against an enemy this weak.  Considering the lives of their wielders, the number of uses is probably quite limited.  Three minutes later, the end of the battle between Hagane’s Militant Nation and the antidemons finally began. 1,000 old soldiers from the Militant Nation of Hagane in black outfits intercepted the wave of antidemons in a beautiful, circular formation.  They were not at all bothered by the dwarves, but I was worried when I saw the soldiers there. However, their coordination was much stronger than we had expected. Their coordination was also tremendous.  Their movements were unsteady, and I could feel the precision of a Drone controlled by artificial intelligence.  Yet, they were still full of fighting spirit. </p>
<p>「Show me what you can do!」</p>
<p>「You won’t let your enemies die even if you defeat them!」</p>
<p>「Nuoooh!」</p>
<p>  Everyone was fighting so hard that they took their places. What was even more unique about them was that they didn’t seem to be afraid of death at all.  They were determined to die, but they didn’t seem to be afraid of death. It was as if they only saw their lives as one of their pieces.  Because they were like that, they naturally consider their friends as their pieces of work. At the same time, if one of her friends next to her falls, she would moan in frustration.  However, she wouldn’t slow down because of it, or she would lose her composure. They were frustrated at the loss of their lives, but they weren’t afraid of death.  It was a strange unit. How could they find such a mental person?  They were still well-rounded as if they were a puppet, with a decent human touch remaining.  However, they didn’t seem to be being controlled or in a hurry. Some of them lost their lives as they fought against about 20,000 antidemons. However, the old soldiers continued fighting without stopping, and eventually defeated the commander.  To be honest, I didn’t expect that they would be able to defeat the commander.  Even though they were not very powerful individuals, they were only capable of being below Rank D or C on their own. I wondered if you were the only commander against them, but the old soldiers fought until the very end. The last attack was a suicide bomb attack.  To our surprise, the old soldiers used a very small range attack magic that sacrificed several lives. They used it to accurately destroy the commander’s nucleus.  They could win against an opponent that would normally be half-destroyed by their troops at the expense of several people. If you ask me if I were to call it an alibi or not, I’m sure they were...  </p>
<p>「... Amazing」</p>
<p>『Yeah.  But Fran, don’t do something like that, okay?Until the very end, they had treated their lives as pieces of victory.Until the very end, they had treated their lives as pieces of victory. In front of them, the hydrangeas stared at us without changing their expressions.</p>
