</div><h1>Chapter 1063</h1><p>The swordsman opens his mouth while holding his sword. There was an unmistakable look of joy on his face. </p>
<p>「I’m Valusa. I am now a member of the Western Knights of the Raidos Kingdom」</p>
<p>「Fran. Rank B adventurer」</p>
<p>「I see. Are you the one who’s in the wreckage of this port?」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p> When Fran nodded, Valusa smiled even more happily. </p>
<p>「Fuhahahaha! I never thought that the adventurers who had looked down on her would be destroyed by this proud fleet! I can’t wait to see the faces of those guys from Raidos!」</p>
<p> I can’t let those faces of Raydoss’s friends be destroyed now!」</p>
<p>「...?  They’re not from Raydoss?」</p>
<p>「No one will rule me.  I’m the only one who has power over me. A true battle junkie! He seemed to be the type who didn’t care about anything else as long as he was willing to fight.  </p>
<p>「Besides, if you cooperate with Raydoss, you can become stronger. The alchemist said something about your life expectancy, but as long as you can be stronger, you don’t mind if he gives you about half of your life expectancy」</p>
<p>『I think he’s a demigod of his race, similar to Mar...』</p>
<p> I don’t know what the difference was with the Demon Demon Demon, but it seemed that he was willing to accept Raidos’ human body modification.I don’t know what the difference was, but it seemed that he was willing to accept Raydoss’s body modification.Innate Skills: False Slayer, Brilliant Swordsmanship: Murderer, traitor equipment: Magic Sword, Soul Drain, Sea Dragon Leather Wargreaves, Sea Dragon Leather Wargreaves, Garments of Magic Whale, Underwater Respiration Collar, Ring of Hawk Eyes </p>
<p>「Has your body been modified by an alchemist from Raydoss?」</p>
<p>「You used appraisal, right?  That’s right.  He said it was a combination of western and eastern alchemists, right?  He’s implanting a small magic stone and the heart of a demonkin, you know? Thanks to that, I’ve gotten a stronger body」</p>
<p>  Just because he’s shaving his life expectancy, right? I can’t understand the nerve to smile happily.  </p>
<p>「What are you after?」</p>
<p>「If you defeat me――」</p>
<p>  I want to say that one of them will die, but I’ll tell you what I know.  But let me kill you instead.  Oh, I’ll tell you first. I don’t know if your goal is only that girl or not, but if you want to escape here, I’ll kill everyone in town, okay?」</p>
<p>「...Don’t run away」</p>
<p>「Then it’s fine.  After all, if you’re going to kill me here, it doesn’t matter what other people are. You can run as you like.」</p>
<p>  Did Fran come to crush the option of running away with only Charlotte?  It seems that her real goal was to fight.  </p>
<p>「The main goal of this town was to secure a supply route.  Oh, and there will be some sunshine next.」</p>
<p>「Resupply and sunlight?」</p>
<p>「A small number of elite troops have already departed to secure a bridgehead to Philias.」</p>
<p>  They were picking up some more inland villages that were firmly connected to Philias. They said that they plan to target some of the villages that they found useful and turn them into a base. Dards was convenient for us to maintain a supply route to the places where they were built.  </p>
<p>「However, replenishing the inland base will be fine as long as we have the authority to control the sea.  Rather than that, it is more important to draw Kranzel’s attention. I was aiming to attract and distribute the country’s forces to Dards」</p>
<p>「... You’re the only one who is strong for that」</p>
<p>「Now that we’ve destroyed the Kranzel fleet, our plan was to not lose even without the water dragonkin. Well, with your appearance, that was a disappointment too」</p>
<p>「...We’ve defeated the Barbra fleet too」</p>
<p>「Fuahahaha!  What’s that!  For the Raidos Kingdom, he really is an epidemic god!」</p>
<p>  Maybe they thought that Rank B or lower. Since Rank A was supposed to be deployed to the borderline, they thought that only adventurers below that level would be deployed to capture Dars. No, the Raidos Kingdom, which looked down on the adventurers, may have underestimated Rank A. They probably thought that they would not lose as long as they continued to shoot from the sea.  </p>
<p>「I was originally planning to join the bridgehead force, but I thought it would be more fun to deal with the adventurers who came to capture us here.  My intuition was correct. They’re too mixed at the borderline, so I can’t even witness them properly.」</p>
<p>「Were the Raydoss forces even going to attack the border...  Alessa?」</p>
<p>「That’s right.  Well, I only know what’s going on with the Western Duke though. The ultimate goal of the Western Duke is to rule over Philias and obtain a Divine Sword」</p>
<p>  Valusa said so and readied his sword.  </p>
<p>「It’s about time, okay?  Let’s kill each other!」</p>
<p>「One last one」</p>
<p>「What is it?」</p>
<p>「What did you want to use Charlotte for?」</p>
<p>「 Charlotte?  Oh, that dancer?  I’ve heard that such a job has the power to interfere with the dragon’s veins, right? She was using it to strengthen the magic circle to attack Philias」</p>
<p>「I see」</p>
<p>「If you’re still alive, you can use the information we have at most」</p>
<p>「That’s their intention」</p>
<p>「Fuhahaha! Then we’ll leave!」</p>
<p>  Valusa slowly slashed at her from the top.  Fran frowned at her――and rushed to the side.  </p>
<p>「Fine!  You didd better!」</p>
<p>(That’s...!)</p>
<p>『Probably is a spur-of-the-moment skill!』</p>
<p>  By recreating killing intent and wind noise, it seemed as if she was really slashing at her. In fact, the real slash was a super-high-speed horizontal cleave that killed both killing intent and sound. It was a poor-quality combination of pulling off an invisible blow and tearing her torso when she was off guard as if she could normally dodge.  Valusa was smiling, even though she didn’t even graze her. In fact, it felt like it was fun and inevitable.  </p>
<p>「 Click here!  Even after you got stronger, you couldn’t kill a swordsman on the same level or higher, and you fell silent. You show up now!」</p>
<p> He’s not just a mere battle junkie, isn’t he particularly insistent on fighting with swords?  </p>
<p>「Teyaaaa!」</p>
<p>「Fuhahaha!  Amazing!  Nice one!」</p>
<p> Valusa let out a loud laugh as he fended off Fran’s blow.  </p>
<p>「You won’t get hit!」</p>
<p>「Shaaaah!」</p>
<p>  Valusa’s Sword Saint Skill was Level 4, and his stats were inferior to Fran’s.  However, he was still able to slash Fran. They were evenly matched.  I guess it was because Fran didn’t dare to use any strengthening skills. Maybe it was Fran’s determination, but she had no intention of winning by sheer brute force based on her stats.  Even so, it was unusual for her to dare to fight with Fran, who had Sword King Skills. She probably lived for the sake of her sword because of her insistence.  She had a huge amount of experience and countless draws in during the battle.  She had mastered the use of fictional slashes that were difficult to use and the flash slash skills that unleash super godspeed attacks, and repeatedly attacked her with a chilling feeling. There was no single attack that was the same pattern, and Fran’s attacks, on the other hand, dealt with it as if she had experienced it.  And Fran, who was more than equal with such an opponent head-on, was also amazing.And Fran, who was evenly separated from such an opponent head-on, was also amazing.  She was able to master her skills.  Five or ten minutes and the sword clash continued, but the two still did not gasp.  Aside from her physical strength, she must have been using a lot of magic power drained from both of them at the same time.  Both of them were using multiple skills at the same time to continuously transfer magic power into the sword.  In fact, Valusa’s magic sword had the ability to suck out our magic power.  Each time it was struck, it was carrying its magic power.  Moreover, it seemed to be sucking away power from the Evil Gods and Fenrir. If it had been the previous unstable situation, it might have had a negative effect on it.  Anyway, it will be a while before Valusa’s magic power runs out.  </p>
<p>「You’re sure! Isn’t your movement getting better?」</p>
<p>「Fufun!」</p>
<p>  It seems that Fran’s Swordking Mastery had been refined through her dense slash with Valusa.  Fran responded with a slash on her face.  Fran, on the other hand, seemed to be enjoying her slash with this man somewhat. But such a happy ending also marked the end of the fight. I saw a black magic bullet launched high in the sky.  </p>
<p>『It’s a signal from Urushi!』</p>
<p>(... Understood.)</p>
<p>  Fran nodded lightly and readied me again. Perhaps feeling something in her movements, Valusa stopped to regain his composure.  </p>
<p>「... Is it over?」</p>
<p>「......</p>
<p>「......Let’s get serious.」</p>
