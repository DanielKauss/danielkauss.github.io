</div><h1>Chapter 955</h1><p>「I now understand why you came to this continent, but I have one piece of advice for you.」</p>
<p>「What?」</p>
<p>「You shouldn’t stay on this continent for too long. This isn’t a place where people with a future like Miss Hilt can stay.」</p>
<p> Isario muttered to himself with a serious look on his face. I could see that he was caring for us from the bottom of his heart. But Fran didn’t seem to be convinced. </p>
<p>「Isario will be staying here forever.」</p>
<p>「I’m not like Miss Hilt. As I said before, I’m just a commoner with a divine sword.」</p>
<p> As I said before, I’m just a commoner with a divine sword」</p>
<p>  I knew it, Isario’s self-evaluated was still low. But I could tell from what he said earlier.  However, I think he has become strong enough to be a Rank S after decades of fighting on this continent... I guess it’s because I don’t think he can make any changes to himself once he gets older.  Isario acted as a bad dad under the pretense that he wasn’t a genius――Isario acted as a bad dad while claiming to be without talent―― well, about half of them were unqualified, but the reason why he dared to show a bad appearance in front of others was probably because he felt that </p>
<p>『If I hadn’t gotten a Divine Sword, I would have been like this for sure』</p>
<p>.  I also noticed the characteristics of the wielders chosen by Gaia and Ignis.I also noticed the characteristics of the wielders chosen by Gaia and Ignis.  Perhaps they would choose those who didn’t get into the mood to get a Divine Sword and instead, those who got a Divine Sword for their crimes.  In the end, it would be unlikely for such people to abuse the Divine Sword or use it for their personal interests.  Not only that, but I think that kind of mental nature was definitely important. </p>
<p>「Well, let’s just take a break and get out of here」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>  Fran nodded her head and stood up.  She was about to use detoxification magic, but before that, Isario had performed detoxification on himself. Did he manage to use recovery magic on his own?  </p>
<p>「Magic?」</p>
<p>「Drinking is a must, right?」</p>
<p>  No, it was just healing magic for booze!  This dad may not have the talent of a sword, but what else is amazing?...? Certainly, healing magic doesn’t have many wielders, right?  </p>
<p>「Are you sure? Will it get sick if I drink too much?」</p>
<p>「Aah, well, you’ll be fine!  This is an investigation request though.  Well, it’s not even necessary to put in liquor, or rather, it’s better to have no smell, right? Okay?」</p>
<p>  Isario, who had pulled out the alcohol, shouted in panic.  It must be hard to tell that it was a lie. I felt sorry for being too desperate, so I’d give him a little support.  </p>
<p>『Fran.  Isario has a point. The smell of alcohol and how he might be found by our enemies』</p>
<p>「I see.  Okay, okay!  That’s what I mean」</p>
<p>  Even though he was supposed to be of a higher rank, for some reason, I felt sorry for him. I thought she was performing half of it, but maybe about eighty per cent of it was her base.  We then set out for the investigation again for now, but we were soon facing something strange. Isario also looked a little serious.  </p>
<p>「It seems they’re dragonkin troops」</p>
<p>「Nn. They’re about thirty in number」</p>
<p>「Hmmm. But the guild didn’t tell me that they would send dragonkin to this area......」</p>
<p>  I had spotted an irregular group of dragonkin.  Could they be working for the Dragon King?  But there was no clearly off-limits land around Trismegistus’ castle. It wouldn’t be a crime to have come to this area on their own, so it wouldn’t be surprising.  </p>
<p>「I guess we have no choice.  Let’s try meeting them for now. Since they are rebellious dragonkin, we might have to fight for them one battle at a time.」</p>
<p>「Your arms are ringing.」</p>
<p>「They’re in good spirits.」</p>
<p>  Isario shrugged his shoulders as if he was in a panic, but he didn’t smile. He must have noticed the killing intent emanating from Fran.  The story about the Dragon King being the main culprit for the black market slavers has been passed down to the Adventurers Guild. Naturally, it was already in Isario’s ears. Judging from his background earlier, he understands why Fran is unable to remain calm towards someone who may be working for the Dragon King.  </p>
<p>「Don’t attack him until he reaches his target, okay?  If you ever antagonize him, you can do whatever you want.」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「Seriously, I’m begging you.」</p>
<p>  Three minutes later. The dragonkin noticed Fran approaching us, so they contacted us quickly.  Just in case, Urushi was hiding in the shadows.  He wanted to disrupt them with a surprise attack when the time comes.  </p>
<p>「Stop!」</p>
<p>「Who are you!?」</p>
<p>  Many of the dragonkin were very young.  It was obvious to me that they were in a lot of trouble. If we just grew up a little further, they might turn into goons.  Their fighting prowess was not that great for dragonkin, and they didn’t even seem to know what they were capable of. And yet, they didn’t seem to be doubting their superiority. All but a few of them were smiling at us with grins on their faces.  </p>
<p>「Suddenly making a commotion. Who the hell are you?」</p>
<p>「No need to answer that.  We’ll be off-limits for now. I’ll let you off the hook if you’re leaving quietly.」</p>
<p>「Huh?  off-limits?  Didn’t we come to investigate on behalf of the Adventurers Guild too? We don’t have such important information in the guild though.  But who in the world did you decide to restrict them from entering?」</p>
<p>「... Tch!」</p>
<p>  A young leader-ranked man sighed when he saw Isario who didn’t seem to be afraid of him. Besides, he was probably caught in Isario’s words.  He must have thought that he was just a normal adventurer wandering around in search of prey. If that were the official guild researchers, they would be the worse off.  However, the dragonkin attitudes were stubborn.  </p>
<p>「This is our continent of dragonkin! Everything we’ve decided is the laws of this continent!」</p>
<p>「Hmm?  I don’t think anyone owns these things, right? They perished because of you guys, so can’t you be arguing for their rights?」</p>
<p>  Isario spoke provokingly in a tone that countered the dragonkin’s nerves.  He was obviously trying to provoke them into anger.  He must be trying to weaken their sound judgment in order to gather information. Anyways, he seemed to have judged that he could not negotiate properly with them.  </p>
<p>「Come on, these naughty bastards, you go back to your house before they get hurt. If you apologize here, I’ll let you off the hook.」</p>
<p>「You little!  Don’t treat us as children!」</p>
<p>「You’re a kid when you say that.</p>
<p>「Kill this old man!」</p>
