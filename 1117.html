</div><h1>Chapter 1117</h1><p>On the night after tomorrow’s transportation of supplies, Fran had visited Klimut the guild.</p>
<p>Fran knocked hard on the door, and there was a scream from inside. As we walked inside, Klimut looked bitter.</p>
<p>「I have told you not to go in before answering, didn’t I? It’s still the same as before! And I also ask that you be a little calmer when you say no.」</p>
<p>「I heard a strange voice, so I thought I had replied.」</p>
<p>「I-Impossible...... Now that my status is back to normal, I’m hearing better, but I’m not getting used to it yet」</p>
<p>So, even if he felt a presence and knew a knock, he would still be surprised by the loud noise. There were about twenty gem-like stones lined up on his desk.</p>
<p>He had a cloth in his hand, and seemed to be refining it. It was a magic stone. Moreover, it seemed to have quite strong magic power. As if to hide it from Fran’s eyes, Klimut put the magic stone in his bag.</p>
<p>「W-What is it?」</p>
<p>「Is that, Rhyn?」</p>
<p>「Y-yes. That’s right.」</p>
<p>Aah―, I’ve been through this kind of thing before. Back then, I had 10 threat levels C and D in total... But of course, that was not all.</p>
<p>So we really didn’t give him everything, huh? Back then, Fran negotiated to take five of them, but I guess Klimut expected all of them.</p>
<p>Maybe, even if all of them had been taken, if Fran had accepted the request, it would have been no problem for Klimut, wouldn’t it? So, Klimut was a true negotiator.</p>
<p>Klimt coughed lightly and changed the subject.</p>
<p>「You need something?」</p>
<p>「Nn. I want to ask you how to use Spirit Magic」</p>
<p>「Now that I think about it, you must have learned Spirit Magic」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran nodded, and Klimut sighed wearily.</p>
<p>「Sigh...... That’s just as good as ever.」</p>
<p>She deposited her body deeply on the back and shook her head several times.</p>
<p>「It’s not something that can be easily learned by other races besides Elves...... I don’t mind if you don’t want to answer, but when and how did you learn it?」</p>
<p>「I’ve only recently learned that」</p>
<p>I beg for his teachings. It is indeed good for bugs to remain completely silent. I must tell him about them to some extent.</p>
<p>Fran was hiding about me too――.</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>While she was explaining the situation, she suddenly fell silent.</p>
<p>「What’s wrong?」</p>
<p>Klimt looked puzzled.</p>
<p>『Fran?』</p>
<p>(Master, can I tell Klimut?)</p>
<p>Oh, so that was what she meant. From the moment we first met, there was a subtle atmosphere between Fran and Klimut. She didn’t have complete trust in the guild, and Klimut didn’t have complete trust in Fran.</p>
<p>The atmosphere here was one of respect for each other, yet one of discernment.</p>
<p>But before she knew it, Fran had completely lost her guard against Klimut. I already trusted Klimut. There was no denying it.</p>
<p>Besides, even if I kept silent, the Great Spirit would still see through me.</p>
<p>「Klimt, I have something important to discuss」</p>
<p>「Eh? Hah, hah. That’s pretty sudden.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Klimt looked as surprised as ever, but after Fran’s creation of a wind barrier, he realized that it was really important.</p>
<p>She straightened up her posture and stared at Fran.</p>
<p>「Let’s ask them.」</p>
<p>「About this sword」</p>
<p>Fran took me with her scabbard and held me aloft. Klimut’s gaze followed me, but a puzzled look came over me. Even though she knew that it was a vicious magic sword that emitted evil energy, she didn’t understand why she was going to bring up that subject now.</p>
<p>「Master」</p>
<p>『Yeah.』</p>
<p>「Hmm? Your voice now is......?」</p>
<p>『The sword in front of me. My name is Master, and I’m Master, an intelligence weapon. Nice to meet you!』</p>
<p>I purposely greeted her in a light atmosphere so as not to get too heavy, but...</p>
<p>「Eh? No, Eeh? The sword is talking... Eeh?」</p>
<p>Klimt was really surprised. Well, it couldn’t be helped. What a surprise, isn’t it more than a divine sword in terms of rarity? But maybe he was a little too surprised.</p>
<p>「I-I never thought I’d run into a legendary being in a place like this... T-This is bad for your heart!」</p>
<p>Klimt was holding his heart and was breathing heavily. Despite his handsome and super strong high-ranking adventurer, he was quite a coward, or rather, a dwarf. He seemed to have a lot of heart.</p>
<p>「I’ve heard that it exists in Gordicia, but this is my first time seeing it in person」</p>
<p>「You believe me?」</p>
<p>「There is no reason for you to lie. In the first place, I usually have conversations with spirits, so I can understand that telepathy is being released from the sword」</p>
<p>She was used to telepathy, and understood perfectly what I was saying.</p>
<p>「Have you ever been to Gordicia?」</p>
<p>「It was a place like a demonkin for spirit magicians. Just by summoning it, the spirits weaken, and it doesn’t heal. I think the reason why the elves were destroyed was because they can’t use spirit magic anymore, right?」</p>
<p>「I see. So, Master is your first Intelligence Weapon?」</p>
<p>「That makes sense. But, Master, isn’t it? It must be a strange name for a magic sword」</p>
<p>『I didn’t have a name for it, but Fran gave it to me! What a nice name, right?』</p>
<p>It was the usual exchange after we revealed our identity, but Klimut was indeed an adult.</p>
<p>「That’s a good name. I can feel Fran’s sense of it」</p>
<p>『You said that right? That’s a good name!』</p>
<p>「Hehe.」</p>
<p>Klimut gave Fran a gentle gaze, clearly smug. I knew he was a good person.</p>
<p>「But now I understand. So, Fran’s imbalance was caused by Master-san’s abilities?」</p>
<p>『Yeah. My ability is――』</p>
<p>When I briefly explained my power, Klimut grunted as he clutched his eyebrows. Well, I know how he felt. I’m sorry, sorry?</p>
<p>「A place like this where top-ranking magic swords are... on the level of a near-Divine Sword, right? Did I know it was better to reveal it to you?」</p>
<p>「Nn. I can trust you, Klimut」</p>
<p>「......Sigh. I can’t believe you’re saying that so straight. I’m not such a good person.」</p>
<p>She covered her eyes and looked up to the sky. Her murmurs didn’t stop. But Klimut, as expected, quickly remembered that she was in the middle of talking.</p>
<p>「So, what does Spirit Magic have to do with Master-san?」</p>
<p>『Actually――』</p>
<p>Klimut fidgeted his eyebrows and held back his stomach with his free left hand. He seemed to be hit by a double punch of headache and stomach pain.</p>
<p>「It’s so irregular that I can’t say anything about it. However, I can feel the presence of spirits inside Fran-san. It seems to have been weakened to such an extent that I couldn’t tell unless you said it」</p>
<p>I know that you supported Fran in the Great Spirit Battle. She should have gotten stronger for a moment, but after that, her presence disappeared again.</p>
<p>「Mar, are you okay?」</p>
<p>「We don’t know. Only in the legends do we know about the existence of a spirit from a human being. However, if Fran’s level of spirit magic increases, we might be able to supply her with power」</p>
<p>「Really?」</p>
<p>「Yes. But it’s not always easy to raise your level, you know? At first, the only thing I could do was to focus my attention on sensing the spirits」</p>
<p>「Even so, I’ll do my best.」</p>
<p>「Yeah, good luck」</p>
<p>Klimut shrugged his shoulders in disbelief. However, there was a soft smile on his face, like that of an old man who watched over his grandchildren.</p>
