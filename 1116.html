</div><h1>Chapter 1116</h1><p>For a few days, we were pretty busy getting rid of the rubble, giving first aid to the injured, and witnessing the interrogation of the captives we had handed over. The captives――or rather, the commander struck a friendly exchange with Klimut. We were sure the wavelengths were on the right track with each other. The commander persuaded the other captives, and the interrogation went very smoothly. He also sold some supplies to the guild. Some item bags and weapons he had stolen from his enemies. An item bag and other items he had stolen from the enemy.  The most expensive item bag was probably the item bag. Unfortunately, the item bag that Hydman and the others had in their possession had been broken because it had been pryed open. Originally, they must have been set up to return to just a bag when it was forcibly opened so that it wouldn’t be reused by the enemy.  The item bags that we had stored in front of us now total about 2 million Goldes.  If Hydman’s bag was alive, it might have reached 3 million. Next time, we’ll have to open it more cautiously.  Fran may have really wanted to go to the battlefield right away, but we can’t leave Alessa unattended.  There’s a risk of Hydman appearing again after all. However, with Klimut’s spirit-based security network starting to work, it would be difficult for Hydman to enter Alessa again.  Once we’ve cleared up our worries, it’s only natural that they wanted to leave soon. However, before Fran could decide on her departure, Klimut would call her.  </p>
<p>「Are you responsible for the transportation mission?」</p>
<p>「Yes.  She is responsible for the transportation of supplies to the border and the transportation of volunteer and valiant soldiers who have gathered from all over the world」</p>
<p> The valiant soldiers will also guard the supplies, and when they arrive at the battlefield, they will be incorporated into each unit. Fran herself will not be treated as a valiant soldier, but as the leader of the troops sent by the guild.  </p>
<p>「... Are you sure?」</p>
<p>  Fran tilted her head and asked Klimut. I guess it was really strange that he was asked to do so.  I know that Klimut does not like to send his children to the front lines. When we were told this request was made, I thought it was a request to leave the battlefield.  It was a request to go to the battlefield. Both Fran and I were surprised by Klimut’s words. Klimut saw Fran’s reaction and smiled bitterly.  </p>
<p>「You are reluctant, aren’t you...?  If we leave it alone, we’re going to just barge into the Raidos Kingdom. Then we’re going to take this request and make sure they’re in a place where we can see it」</p>
<p>「I see」</p>
<p>  I see! I see, that’s not what I meant!  He said he was gonna do it, and he said he’ll keep an eye on us! I can also kinda guess that there’s a backlash in this request.  It would take a lot of time just to move a few warriors and a large amount of supplies. In other words, Klimut was trying to delay Fran’s arrival at the battlefield. Well, I’m grateful for that since it allows me to understand Klimut’s feelings. Perhaps, I don’t understand it myself, so the hurdles are lowered not only for killing her, but also for fighting and the battlefield.  I guess that’s one of the parts of the barrier that the Gods have placed on her when she became a sword. Even though she was determined not to impose the common sense of Earth on Fran, I could tell that it was strange that Fran, a child, didn’t even show any aversion to the battlefield.  Even after thinking about it that far, I still didn’t feel like pulling Fran away from the battlefield.That’s why I didn’t feel like we were trying to separate Fran from the battlefield.  That’s why I am grateful to have adults who saw Fran as a child, like Klimut.  </p>
<p>『Fran.  I’ll take this request』</p>
<p>(Should I accept it?)</p>
<p>『Yeah, I think so』</p>
<p>  Fran, who wanted to go to the battlefield as soon as possible, was not sure if she would accept the request.  </p>
<p>「Okay.  I’ll accept the request」</p>
<p>「Ho-you’re right.  Is that so?  That’s good. The Gibyaku army is expected to arrive in a few days, so please wait in Alessa until then.」</p>
<p>「You haven’t arrived in Alessa yet?」</p>
<p>「Yeah.  That’s right, what is it?」</p>
<p>「...It’s nothing」</p>
<p> Oops, this was done.  I didn’t know that the valiant soldiers had not arrived yet. Well, I knew it though.  </p>
<p>『Fran.  I understand your impatience, but calm down. This request is quite important, right?』</p>
<p>(Is that so?)</p>
<p>『Yeah.  The same goes for the warriors, but they really need supplies. Fran, what if they get hungry on the battlefield?』</p>
<p>(Let’s put out the food and eat it.)</p>
<p>『What if I don’t have anything to eat in my storage or in the camp?  You’ve been hungry for a long time, you know? Can we fight with that?』</p>
<p>(I can’t fight!  Food is important!)</p>
<p>『Right?  So this supplies are important. In a sense, it’s even more important than our forces.』</p>
<p>(Okay! Bringing food to everyone.)</p>
<p>  Fran’s motivation switch was flipped.  She must have understood the importance of replacing her with her own body. She looked back at Klimut with a firm eye.  </p>
<p>「W-what is it?  Don’t tell me if I won’t take it this time, okay?  I-I won’t tell you, right?」</p>
<p>「I’ll definitely complete this request」</p>
<p>「Ha-ha.  I’m also happy if I’m motivated for some reason. So, you’re willing to accept it, aren’t you?」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  Fran, who had received a request from Klimut, used her waiting time to hunt around Alessa. She wanted to secure some food for them in case of emergency.  She accepted a hunting request and processed it from one side. She took half of the meat by herself and sold the other half to the guild.  </p>
<p>「Fran-chan, thank you!  Thanks to that, I’ve secured quite a lot of meat for you!」</p>
<p>「You have enough food?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. Nell-san was overjoyed to see Fran bring in a large amount of magic beast meat in just half a day.  Even though the taste was not that great, she hunted it for a large magic beast. They dismantled the slightly smelly and hard meat, such as magic beasts similar to Elephants and magic beasts similar to hippos, with the help of all the adventurers.  The dried meat must have been a lot. I wonder if they’ve been serving a lot of food since they came back to the Kingdom of Kranzel. </p>
<p>「Nell, have you heard about your request?」</p>
<p>「You mean the transportation of supplies?  Yes, there’s not much for us.  I’ll prepare someone who knows the way, so you don’t have to worry about it」</p>
<p>「Those who know the way? </p>
<p>「The border area is now Raidos, but it was originally a different country」</p>
<p>  Currently, there is no country between Kranzel and Raidos.  Oh, we have Philias, huh? But that’s all.  However, until about 50 years ago, there were several small countries, and they seemed to have been acting as a cushion for both countries. It had been absorbed by one of the countries now, but there were quite a few people from that country. </p>
<p>「What kind of person is he?」</p>
<p>「I wonder if he’s a bad guy? Well, since he’s a high-ranked adventurer, he has a lot of things to do with him」</p>
<p>  A high-ranked adventurer, huh?  Well then, he’s a weirdo.However, until about 50 years ago, there were some small countries that served as cushions for both countries.

It seemed that adventurers working for the guild were all from the ruined countries and gave directions to them. </p>
