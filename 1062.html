</div><h1>Chapter 1062</h1><p>I heard that the captives were captured in the middle of Dards.</p>
<p>As we went to check with the unconscious magic beastman carrying him, I saw people sitting in the open-air plaza with their hands restrained. What were we going to do if it rained? I wonder what all the captives were going to do if they got wet right now?</p>
<p>Charlotte was sitting in the center of the plaza, seemingly unharmed.</p>
<p>( Charlotte!)</p>
<p>『Wait. The guy next to me is pretty strong.』</p>
<p>(Mrgh.)</p>
<p>There were only a few soldiers guarding the entire horde. They must have headed to the harbor and been defeated by us. There were about 30 soldiers, and I could tell that they were all floating on the ground.</p>
<p>「W-What’s the situation in the harbor?」</p>
<p>「I’ve heard stories of enemies raging rampant, but I don’t know for sure......!」</p>
<p>「It looks like the battle is over, but...!」</p>
<p>The anomaly in the harbor had been reported, but detailed information on it had yet to be found.</p>
<p>However, the gray-haired swordsman beside Charlotte was of a different rank. He emitted the presence of a strong person and was paying attention to the surroundings in an arrogant way. So, it was obvious that only one of them was on a different level.</p>
<p>Fran pondered as she hid in the shadows to see what he was doing.</p>
<p>(Master, what should we do?)</p>
<p>『Going head-on is too risky.』</p>
<p>We could destroy the enemy troops in a short time. I’m confident that even if they were to take me hostage, my surprise attack would eliminate only the enemies without hurting them hostages without any problems.</p>
<p>But that would happen if they were up against someone other than the swordsman beside Charlotte.</p>
<p>There was a hint of Marl in the man’s eyes. Perhaps he had been transformed. However, he didn’t have a slave collar. Was he following Raidos on his own? Anyway, since he was not a puppet, his experience and thinking skills must have been alive.</p>
<p>If we go head-on, we have no intention of losing. However, there was no doubt that there would be considerable damage. We can’t just go on the offensive just fine.</p>
<p>(Woof!)</p>
<p>『Oh, we’re back, Urushi!』</p>
<p>Good timing. They had evacuated the adventurers out of town and returned. With Urushi’s help, their probability of saving the captured people would skyrocket.</p>
<p>(So――)</p>
<p>『I see―』</p>
<p>(Woof――)</p>
<p>We made a brief plan and began our move. Fran jumped up using an aerial jump and moved secretly to the rooftop of the building where we could see the square.</p>
<p>Then, while being conscious of not leaking any magic power, I activated my Light Magic.</p>
<p>「Uwah!」</p>
<p>「What the hell is that?」</p>
<p>The soldiers were surprised to see a sudden radiating object appeared in the sky above the plaza. They probably expected it to have something to do with the harbor, but they didn’t know how to respond.</p>
<p>After all, it was just a sphere of light with no offensive power. Its purpose was to create a dense shadow by sunlight and strong light.</p>
<p>「Shut up! Be wary of your surroundings!」</p>
<p>『That guy really is a nuisance.』</p>
<p>The soldier made a commotion, and the gray-haired swordsman shouted at them to shut them up. Immediately afterward, the man pulled out the sword from the item bag at his waist.</p>
<p>Even from a distance, I could feel a chilling magic power coming from it. It must be a very high-level magic sword.</p>
<p>The man held up his magic sword on the spot and shook it off. The slash that was fired hit the ball of light and erased it――but this one was a split second faster!</p>
<p>『Urushi!』</p>
<p>(Woof!)</p>
<p>Urushi, who had been kneading the magic power next to Fran, activated his shadow magic before the man destroyed the ball of light. The shadow at his feet turned into a spear and skewered the soldiers one after another. They were able to hardly react at all because they were watching the light in the sky.</p>
<p>The only one who evaded it was the swordsman.</p>
<p>That’s probably half of them had collapsed. Not only the soldiers on the roofs of the square but also the surrounding buildings were lying in the blood.</p>
<p>The other half of it was my job.</p>
<p>Seconds after we were delayed in Urushi’s attack. Using the steel threads stretched out all over the square, we slammed ice and snow magic at once into the nearby soldiers. We had planned to hit the swordsman as well, but we gave up.</p>
<p>The swordsman stepped forward a few steps and closed their distance from Charlotte. He shouldn’t be able to take any casual attacks on the swordsman as long as they might get caught in his attack. His judgment was so accurate that it was frustrating.</p>
<p>「Gyiahhhh!」</p>
<p>「Ugyaaah!」</p>
<p>What I used was the ice and snow magic, i.e. Ice and snow magic had an advantage. It was difficult to target only the soldiers with thunder magic and flame magic. I would have preferred earth magic, but ice and snow magic had an advantage.</p>
<p>Even if she failed to kill them, cold air would deprive her of her strength and slow her down.</p>
<p>『Is there anyone that can move?』</p>
<p>(Nn. I’ve defeated all the soldiers in the plaza.)</p>
<p>『What about the soldiers?』</p>
<p>I really didn’t know that it could block both Urushi and my attacks... But this was well within my expectations again.</p>
<p>(Urushi!)</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「This is...... How could such a magic beast be here!?」</p>
<p>「Grrr! Grrr!」</p>
<p>「Kyaa!」</p>
<p>「There’s no way she’s wild... But there’s a woman in her right...」</p>
<p>The dark spear that Urushi unleashed burst, hurting Charlotte’s skin. I’m sorry to Charlotte, but I had her attack as if the aftermath hit. I’ll apologize later, so please endure it for now!</p>
<p>Urushi was doing a bloodthirsty beast-like act. The swordsman was also confused as he didn’t know where Urushi was after Charlotte’s lightly wounded attack.</p>
<p>We were not sure if we should take a hostage or not, but Fran and I didn’t miss it.</p>
<p>『Now!』</p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>Fran slashed at him as soon as he teleported. However, I couldn’t feel any presence of a swordsman slicing through his flesh on my blade. Instead, she collided with the hard one and became a brim.</p>
<p>It was a man’s magic sword. Will it react at this timing too! But it was just as we planned! Well, it would have been great if we could defeat it with this one blow!</p>
<p>「This is......! Nuogh!」</p>
<p>「Let’s go together!」</p>
<p>『Urushi, move as planned!』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Fran and I pushed our opponent into the Dimension Gate at our feet. Even this man could not escape while putting up a barrier with Fran. If he escaped forcibly, he would become an opening and fall victim to Fran’s attack.</p>
<p>Our teleportation destination was the harbor. Fran tried to cut down the man in her position, but despite the floating sensation of teleportation, she regained her stance and parried it.</p>
<p>「Girl, let’s do this!」</p>
<p>「You too.」</p>
<p>Their gazes clashed and they both grinned. Aah, the gray-haired swordsman from our opponent was also a battle junkie.</p>
