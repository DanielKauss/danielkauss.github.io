</div><h1>Chapter 968</h1><p>Their forces should be evenly matched as much as possible. Normally, they would want to separate the three divine swords. However, there was one problem here. They would be treated as Berserk. Because of the nature of the outburst, bringing a large army without any obstacles could cause them to take down each other. However, the council was worried that they would be unleashed on the current continent without any restraints. However, the council was apparently worried that they would be unleashed on the current continent without any restraints against Berserk.  Therefore, they decided to accompany Isario as a guide for the Militant Nation of Hagane. The third unit was in the form of Jayne, Orfalve, and Hilt.  Sophie and Mea were not here by the way, since the repairs to the wall in Sendia were not complete yet and they had prioritized their defense. The council couldn’t just abandon their strongholds and save other towns, so they accepted their argument.  Fran was in the second unit.  There were only a few soldiers here because of the two divine swords. Instead, they all had faces that allowed them to move fast and high-speed. It could be said that they were formed with a focus on mobility so that they could reach the farther giant-types as soon as possible.  The unit consisted of the Militant Nation of Hagane, which they had fought with before, and a group of knights carrying knights carrying knights.  Along with Isario, who was leading the unit, Fran and his party were also heading south. Our destination was one of the illegal cities located in the south west of Sendia. The adventurers, with Fran as their commander, were now unable to communicate with them.  They were running at the same speed as the knights, thanks to the increase in speed and vitality of the adventurers led by Fran. The old soldiers of Isario and Hagane, who we had already seen at least once, were making a noise again.  They must feel strange before they were unfamiliar with it. Isario slipped the board and approached us, and Fran checked it out loud.  </p>
<p>「Miss Hilt...  This is your skill or magic, right?」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>「I see...  How long will this last?  You may have activated it for a very long time last time, right? If you’re pushing yourself too hard, you can take a break in the middle of the road」</p>
<p>「No problem」</p>
<p>  Since the March of the Valkyrie was a title, there was no direct burden on Fran.  She only needed to activate her own part because she would only share some of her skills with her subordinates. It didn’t increase her fatigue in any way. Well, the effect is halved when it is shared, so she’s probably using the skills stronger than usual, but that’s about it.  Hearing that, Isario thought to himself with a serious look. His face was very difficult. </p>
<p>「Take this title for granted.」</p>
<p>  Then, in a tone that only Fran could hear, he spoke a few words of advice.  </p>
<p>「It’s too easy for the military to use.  You’d better not know him around Silard, right?」</p>
<p>  The Holy Nation has become less and less aware of him. Even Isario must have thought that it was a skill or magic that required some kind of price.  Come to think of it, it’s a natural ability to be mistaken.  It was a title obtained through skill-sharing with me, but it should be difficult for a normal person to get it. Or rather, it may not be possible under normal circumstances.  The War Maiden skill, which was considered to be a prerequisite, was an Innate Skill of Valkyrie. I wasn’t sure if ordinary people would be able to learn it either.  Thanks to that, there was little chance that what kind of ability it was at first glance. It was a title that they wouldn’t normally have, and they shouldn’t know about it.  My main concern was appraisal, but I was sure she would be fine as long as she had a bracelet disguised as the Silver Lady.  However, as Isario seemed to think, some people would notice the strangeness if they had experienced it many times. The people of the Kingdom of Hagane could also feel something strange. </p>
<p>『Hmm.  What should we do?』</p>
<p>  The best way would be to take a break and not use it for a while under the guise of fatigue. I’d imagine that it would be impossible to use it for a long time.  But Fran didn’t like that. </p>
<p>(We’ll be that late if we take a break)</p>
<p>『Well, that’s true...』</p>
<p>(We’ll have to hurry a little longer if we don’t want to)</p>
<p>  Now that the giant-types were on a rampage, she didn’t want to delay the march for her own reasons. While we were discussing what to do with Fran, Isario was moving first.  We then approached the commander of the Hagane army to discuss our future actions.  </p>
<p>「Saki-dono, we’ll take a short break in the hill ahead. We’ll have to give them a short break on our horses since the adventurers are all running around.」</p>
<p>「You’re right, I understand. But like I saw before, the speed of this march was really high with no real injuries」</p>
<p>「Ha-ha-ha!  Right?  It’s the effect of a valuable magic tool, you know?」</p>
<p>「Oh?  It’s Isario-dono’s possession, right?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. I got it from someone I know」</p>
<p>  To my surprise, she said it was the effect of her magical tool. After hearing her words, Fran looked at Isario with a look that made him realize his true identity.  </p>
<p>「Isario, what he is now」</p>
<p>「Well, just leave this part to Uncle. I won’t be able to lay a finger on him, and he’ll even say that he managed to destroy him in the middle of a fight if things were to get worse」</p>
<p>「...Why would you do that?」</p>
<p>「Oji-san is a creature that wants to show his pride to the young people.  Besides, the young lady is still going up. It’s not a bad idea to leave a favor with him right now, right?」</p>
<p>「Thanks」</p>
<p>「It’s just a loan, you know? We’ll be in trouble if you die until we return it, okay?」</p>
<p>「Nn.  I’ll definitely pay you back」</p>
<p>「Please do that」</p>
<p>  Isario, that’s no good dad, isn’t it?Not only Fran but also I seemed to be starting to like him.</p>
