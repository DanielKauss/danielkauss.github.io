</div><h1>Chapter 1056</h1><p>Leaving Urushi to handle the mess, Fran and I headed for Barbra’s port. It had been pretty destroyed since then, so it seems the Raidos fleet had focused their shots on the main facilities.</p>
<p>However, many of the normal facilities and houses were surprisingly safe.</p>
<p>I could feel a lot of people coming towards us, as if they had noticed the change after the barrage had stopped. A familiar presence was at the front.</p>
<p>「Over there」</p>
<p>『Yeah, let’s head out too.』</p>
<p>A few minutes later, we encountered a group of adventurers.</p>
<p>「Fran! You too, Fran!」</p>
<p>「Gamdo.」</p>
<p>Leading the group was Gamudo, a former A-Ranked adventurer and Guild Master of Barbra. He seemed to be safe.</p>
<p>Well, I don’t think a simple bombardment would be enough to take care of this guy though.</p>
<p>「What happened to them! And who are they?」</p>
<p>「Those guys from Raydoss.」</p>
<p>「What!」</p>
<p>When they found out that the three whom Fran dragged with her preserve was from Raidos, they overflowed with killing intent from Gamudos and the others. They must have understood that their enemy was the fleet of the Kingdom of Raidos. Well, they’re holding the flag too.</p>
<p>Fran handed Gamudo the information she had received from the men and entrusted her to him.</p>
<p>「Can I ask you?」</p>
<p>「Well, we have no hope, but what are you going to do with Fran?」</p>
<p>「Let’s go to an orphanage」</p>
<p>I felt a little rushed because I was worried about what was going on with the orphanage. But Gamudo smiled at us.</p>
<p>「Then I’ll be fine, okay? After all, I was there that time」</p>
<p>「Really?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. We went to see them, but they’re all safe. There’s an underground escape room that Amanda made with all her might. Well, she’ll be fine as long as we don’t launch a large-scale magic attack directly on her」</p>
<p>「I see...... That’s good.」</p>
<p>If Gamudo was giving us a thumbs-up, I guess we really would be fine. Fran was relieved, stroking her chest.</p>
<p>「There’s still an enemy ship in the harbor」</p>
<p>「What!? Are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Urushi is keeping an eye on them. Besides, all the ships in Raidos have sunk. What’s left is the ship of Seedrun」</p>
<p>「Aah―, I see... I wonder what’s going on?」</p>
<p>The first surprise attack had destroyed the ships of the Barbra Navy, causing great damage to the sailors. They did not even have the strength to capture and require enemy ships.</p>
<p>「However, we can’t just leave it like that. I’d be grateful if it could be used with us」</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we could incorporate Seedran’s ships and crew members into our fleet, it would cover for Barbra’s lost forces. I don’t know what the Raidos Kingdom would do in the future, but it would be better to have as much power as possible.</p>
<p>「What’s the new feudal lord?」</p>
<p>「......I’m a good political person, but I don’t mind the fight...... I’d be grateful if you could also give authority to Crystal’s master, but what about it?」</p>
<p>They were not incompetent, but they seemed not very good at fighting. They were probably sent civilian lords to help Barbra recover.</p>
<p>However, there was nothing Fran could do about that. We had no choice but to leave it to Gamudo and the others.</p>
<p>「...Fran. I’ll do my best to help you take over the ship, and I’ll give you a good reward」</p>
<p>「...Okay」</p>
<p>I was also curious about the orphanage, but we couldn’t just leave the port and Urushi unattended. They seemed to have decided to deal with this problem first. Fran then began to turn back on the way we had come, led by Gamudo and the others.</p>
<p>「Sorry about that. I’m not good at the sea」</p>
<p>『Uhh, we’re dwarves, huh?』</p>
<p>I’ve heard that dwarves were a race that could not swim. Even Gamudo couldn’t do anything against them if they were at sea. I guess he could do nothing in land battles because of that.</p>
<p>「Fran, I have something to talk」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>For some reason, Gamudo whispered to Fran. She has ears on her head, so she can whisper without crouching.</p>
<p>They said the beard, which was characteristic of dwarves, hit them and made them tickle.</p>
<p>「About your rank」</p>
<p>「...? B」</p>
<p>「Well, I know. No, it’s all about rank up」</p>
<p>Gamudo said so and dragged Fran a little further away from everyone. He must have been careful not to be asked by the other adventurers.</p>
<p>「It seems you have done a lot in Gordicia. I’ve got a recommendation to rank up.」</p>
<p>「So we’re going to rank up?」</p>
<p>「That’s not going to be that easy. You have a lot of special circumstances after all」</p>
<p>She was simply too young. Moreover, she had been an adventurer for less than two years. Although she was strong, it couldn’t be helped if she was told that she was being treated too special. Besides, the root of her problem and her aptitude had not been determined.</p>
<p>In addition, it was said that their activities this time were also questioned. There were many times when there were no witnesses, and people were wondering if they really were able to do a great job on a battlefield where there were several Rank S adventurers and Seven Sages.</p>
<p>Isario also made a hideout about me and gave us a report, but that was why there seemed to be a subtle gap between us, or rather, there were times when I couldn’t say for sure that Fran had performed well.</p>
<p>「If you wanted to be Rank A, you would have to have tangible achievements and the approval of other countries. Honestly, there is a high possibility that we will not be seeing her this time」</p>
<p>「Yeah.」</p>
<p>There was not much frustration on Fran’s face as she nodded easily. Gamudo seemed to have noticed as well.</p>
<p>「Why? You’re not frustrated, you know? I’m frustrated. There’s no way you’re gonna report a lie. It’s true, right?」</p>
<p>「Nn. But Rank A is still too early for me」</p>
<p>『Fran...』</p>
<p>「Rank A adventurers are amazing, I haven’t caught up with them yet. So, it’s too early for me」</p>
<p>Fran shook her head in response to Gamudo’s words. To Fran, an A-ranked adventurer was more than just a dream. Amanda, Forrund, and Hilt.</p>
<p>Amanda ran several orphanages and saved many children. Forrund was one such organization, and even the royalty was able to negotiate well with him. She had also traveled all over the country to various requests. Hilt took over the Dimitris school and raised many disciples.</p>
<p>It is not a kind of social contribution, but only the best adventurers with various abilities, beauty, and experience in addition to their strength are allowed to become Rank A.</p>
<p>Rank S is no longer a person, and I don’t think it’s something she would want to be. In that sense, Rank A, which is the best achievement of her efforts, may seem particularly special to Fran.</p>
<p>「......I see. If you say that, I’m sure it was. From my point of view as a former Rank A adventurer, I think you can do it, don’t you?」</p>
<p>「Still, not yet」</p>
<p>「I see. Well, the next time you make a achievement, you’ll be promoted without a doubt. When that happens, you’ll have to be promoted, okay?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>While we were talking about this, we saw the harbor. As Urushi’s huge body approached, I could feel the faces of the adventurers tearing away.</p>
<p>If Fran hadn’t told her this was her beast servant, she must have escaped. Urushi, whose battle mode of guarding the ship to not escape was that impactful.</p>
<p>Gamudo was probably the only one who was calm. As one would expect from a man who was part of a team that specialized in dragon hunting. Even in front of Urushi now, he was not afraid of him.</p>
<p>「Fran, can you guide them to come this way?」</p>
<p>「You want to enter the harbor?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. We’ll go in there and take over the crew directly」</p>
<p>「Okay」</p>
<p>However, the current Port of Barbra and its surrounding area were not very moveable due to the remains of the sunken battleship.</p>
<p>So, we decided to first clean it from the remains of the ship. All we needed to do now was to crush it and stow it away.</p>
<p>When the sea was clean to some extent, we would go directly to the surviving ships and prompt them to enter the harbor in turn.</p>
<p>I thought they were at a disadvantage here, but the sailors of the Sea Kingdom of Sydran were obedient. Come to think of it, I’ve been watching the fighting power of Fran and Urushi up close. So, I guess they didn’t have the energy to resist.</p>
<p>It was still before it landed, so there should be a decent number of combat-specialized Marines, but no one refused. It took a long time, but we succeeded in taking over 11 ships.</p>
<p>The ships themselves were good and small. Otherwise, they would be unable to sail, and Fran and Urushi would have to bring them to the harbor by force.</p>
<p>Well, they could probably use it if I were to fix it. Well, some shipwrecks could even use repairs on their ships after all.</p>
<p>(Weary.)</p>
<p>(Arf.)</p>
<p>『I guess this is the end of the harbor work. So, we’ll have to eat there before we go to the orphanage huh?』</p>
<p>「Nn! Curry!」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>「F-Fran. What’s wrong suddenly?」</p>
<p>Oops, I was surprised by Gamudo. I’ll make the curry for you. But it must be Master’s special curry, okay?</p>
