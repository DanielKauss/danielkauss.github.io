</div><h1>Chapter 1057</h1><p>As we were eating at the harbor, people started to gather one after another. The smell of curry didn’t catch us――but the sound of the battle was gone, so they must have come to see us.</p>
<p>Then word spread that there were many people in the harbor, and they began to gather at the harbor one after another.</p>
<p>We had to serve the food to Gamudo and the others and serve nothing to those who followed. We also met quite a few people we knew during the cooking contest.</p>
<p>As a result, she kept serving the dishes in her storage, and before she knew it, it looked like she was ready to eat.</p>
<p>They were even busier than when fighting, unloading the troops they had taken from the Raidos fleet to cook the peas and wheat, and having Urushi catch fish from the sea in front of them.</p>
<p>The cooks and people from the Cooking Guild who brought in the ingredients joined in as well, and in the end, it became a large cooking tournament of several thousand people.</p>
<p>There was a staircase next to a super-sized pot that could accommodate up to several people, brought in from somewhere, and hundreds of servings of soup were mixed with spears. It reminded me of the imo-ni-kai ( literally, a group of stewed potatoes in a small group) in Yamagata.</p>
<p>There were many smiles on their faces in the harbor. Some of them were badly injured, but they were smiling, even if they were fine or pushed themselves. They knew that it was no use being depressed.</p>
<p>Besides, we hadn’t even taken them into custody. Everyone was giving away and sharing food with each other. I could tell just how strong the people of Barbra were.</p>
<p>「Fran, it seems that they didn’t only served meals for us, but also defeated the ones from Raydoss. Thank you very much」</p>
<p>「Meccham.」</p>
<p>The old man sat at the edge of the harbor, watching the sea and talking to Fran. He was a bigwig in the cooking guild, and he was Fran’s natural enemy, Meccham.</p>
<p>I’m sure Fran viewed us more like a rival than any other adventurer.</p>
<p>「And this time’s soup... You’ve been serving a lot of bowls of rice, are you okay?」</p>
<p>He was an amateur in combat, but a professional in cooking. He seemed to have seen the dishes served and understood that the cost of ingredients would be quite high.</p>
<p>But Fran shook her head in frustration.</p>
<p>「It’s okay. I’ll use the materials I took from my enemies, and I’ll just defeat the magic beast again after all」</p>
<p>「...I see. But it was originally that we had to be in the Cooking Guild. If you ever have any problems with cooking in the future, come and talk to us. I’ll be of assistance」</p>
<p>「Nn. Okay」</p>
<p>Meccham said he was not going to give us money. He must have understood Fran’s intentions, even though it would take money to recover from this attack.</p>
<p>「Fran-san. Thank you very much. The children seemed to be in good spirits too」</p>
<p>Next to call out to us was Io-san of the orphanage. It seemed that one of the officials from the orphanage had told her about the soup they served, and she had brought in the children along the way.</p>
<p>That may sound a little awkward, but I guess the adventurers have guards over them, so they can’t keep the kids in the basement all the time.</p>
<p>Amanda was aware of what she was worried about, so there was no sign of the ruffians picking a fight with her. In fact, there was even the presence of everyone watching over her.</p>
<p>Fran and the people of town were relieved to see the children eating their meals with smiles on their faces.</p>
<p>「What about Charlotte?」</p>
<p>「He’s heading north.」</p>
<p>「The battle against Raydoss?」</p>
<p>「No, I’m Dards.」</p>
<p>I thought he was involved in a war in the north, but it seems that Charlotte was sent to the port town of Dards. There was a festival to pray for fertility, and she was invited to be a dancer for that festival.</p>
<p>「You’re in Dards? When?」</p>
<p>「I left a week ago. I think he’s already in Dards by now...」</p>
<p>I heard that Dards had already been attacked by Raidos, but... Is Charlotte safe? Fran was also worried.</p>
<p>Without saying anything to Io, we headed for a corner where the adventurers were gathered. After the restraints on the Seedrun sailors had been completed, they were now eating and drinking to raise their spirits before they pulled up any supplies or materials they could use.</p>
<p>「Gamdo.」</p>
<p>「Fran, what’s wrong?」</p>
<p>「I want to know what happened to Dahz」</p>
<p>「......This way.」</p>
<p>Gamudo must have thought that it was not something he could talk about so frankly. Gamudo then took Fran to a distance.</p>
<p>「To be honest, I don’t know what’s the details.」</p>
<p>「Did you contact me for any reason?」</p>
<p>「Hey. I’ve tried to send them a message, but they don’t respond. If what they say is true, then by now......」</p>
<p>「I see...」</p>
<p>In this situation, no good news came out of my head. I couldn’t get any information out of this by any stretch of the imagination.</p>
<p>「There were a few adventurers from Barbra at the Dahz festival」</p>
<p>This time’s request was not a personal request to Charlotte, but a request between the guilds. Therefore, they sent ten people, including guards and negotiators.</p>
<p>Among them were three of our acquaintances, the Scarlet Maidens and the alchemist, Jugeon. It seemed that they were planning to give a lecture to the Scarlet Maidens as their escort, and Jugeon to Dards.</p>
<p>「Fran, what are you planning to do now? I’d love to stay in this town forever, but I don’t have any intention of doing so, right?」</p>
<p>「Let’s go to Alessa」</p>
<p>「I see... Hey, can you accept a request?」</p>
<p>「Request?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. I want you to take a look at the coastal area, including Dards. What do you say?」</p>
<p>I finally thought that the detestable wounds in front of us had been healed, but it turns out the Great Magic Beast was once again damaged. They don’t have the luxury of sending adventurers to Castel.</p>
<p>After informing Dards, the magic tool used for the communications turned the entire guild into ashes due to the magic bombardment. So, they couldn’t use it anymore.</p>
<p>Therefore, he thought it was the most reliable way to get information from outside adventurers to Fran, who was fast-tracked.</p>
<p>Besides, Fran was not aware of it, but Gamudo probably didn’t want to let Fran go to Alessa. She was sure that she would get caught in the war.</p>
<p>Rather than that, it would be better to give them a request to gather information about the port town. That seemed to be what they were looking for.</p>
<p>『Fran. I think I can accept this request』</p>
<p>(But...... Are you going to Alessa?)</p>
<p>『It seems many adventurers have turned north, and Klimut, Amanda, and Jean are in the first place. They’ve also been to Forrund and Fermus』</p>
<p>(I see...)</p>
<p>As for Fran, she didn’t seem to be worried that Alessa would be dropped. Still, she was worried. However, there was someone she was more worried about now.</p>
<p>In the end, Fran decided to accept Gamudo’s request.</p>
<p>「Nn. He’ll look at Dards.」</p>
<p>「I’m counting on you. But don’t do this alone, okay? If there are too many adventurers, I’ll just report them to you. Okay?」</p>
<p>「Nn! Don’t worry!」</p>
