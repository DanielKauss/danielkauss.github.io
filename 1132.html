</div><h1>Chapter 1132</h1><p>The Raidos Kingdom’s invasion plan was greatly disrupted due to the collapse of their original plan. In particular, it seemed that almost all the operations that the Western Duke was trying to do were gone, and they couldn’t expect any support from him. When we asked them about this, we found out that about eighty per cent of them were because of us. We only fought desperately to resist Raidos, but I didn’t know that he had caused a huge damage to the Western Duke unexpectedly... I was completely unaware of the curse return. I was completely unaware of the curse return.  So, the Southern Duke planned to draw the Kranzel army deep into the country and strike them. Without resisting, he surrendered to the Kranzel Kingdom on the way, secretly gathering information and channeling it to the Southern Duke.  And so, the plan was to completely strip the Kranzel’s forces and destroy them with the help of the Southern Duke, the Black Skeleton Corps, and the Zhu Flame Knights. Naturally, the Black Skeleton Corps also had high-ranking members as well. Or rather, the Avengers were supposed to be summoned as well. </p>
<p>「Well, we’ve lost control, so I don’t think they’ll be summoned.」</p>
<p>  The Black Skeleton Corps had ritual magic to summon and return the undead at once, and if they used that, the surprise attacks would be as expected. They said that it was just being developed and is still being tested in battle, but it’s working fine. The undead’s army that attacked the town of Alessa was the product of the test.  </p>
<p>「No matter how strong the army of the Kranzel Kingdom is, it will not be possible this time. They seem to be divided into three sides, and each one of them will be defeated」</p>
<p>「... Let’s go!」</p>
<p>『Okay, but what’s the plan here?  Leave the warriors behind?』</p>
<p>  If we leave them here, the rank-up exam would be disqualified, and if we just leave the warriors behind, they might be annihilated. After all, it was an enemy area.  I thought about leaving the ghouls as an escort, but I don’t know what would happen if I left.  So, I’ll have Mareficent protect me? However, I guess they saw through my thought. </p>
<p>「Taking care of the warriors is no chores, you know?」</p>
<p>「Muh」</p>
<p>  It was as simple-minded as ever, but it was kinda impressive. I couldn’t trust him.  That’s when I realized something. Now there were about seventy members in the ghouls, and if there were thirty more of them, the March of the Valkyrie would be activated.  </p>
<p>「Hey, Avenger」</p>
<p>「What is it!  My priestess!」</p>
<p>「Can you summon the undead with fast legs?」</p>
<p> For the next few hours, the march was nothing short of harsh.  They cut through the grass, climbed the steep slope one step ahead of the cliff, and continued to walk on the road without a road. Moreover, they were always breathing badly, their limbs were covered with scratches from rubbing, and their muscles were screaming.  Meanwhile, the cries of agony and </p>
<p>「Woooof!  Curry!」</p>
<p> continued to flow from their mouths.We cut through the grass, climbed up the steep slope one by one in front of the cliff, and continued to walk along the path without a road.  Moreover, she was always breathing hard.  Her arms and legs were covered with scratches from rubbing, and her muscles were screaming.  Meanwhile, the voices of distress and the shouts of </p>
<p>「Whoa!  Curry!」</p>
<p>  kept leaking out from her mouth.  Well, the brave soldiers were fine, but Fran, Mareficent, and Avenger looked calm.  </p>
<p>「I’ll do my best for now」</p>
<p>「Karee!」</p>
<p>「Ury!」</p>
<p>「Fitoo!  Karee!」</p>
<p> To be honest, I don’t think they shouldn’t have curry as a tail anymore, but Fran and the valiant soldiers were too used to it and were probably not aware of their strangeness.  Sometimes they chased away magic beasts.  Sometimes they helped each other with their friends, and sometimes they helped the undead. All of the warriors managed to survive on their own without falling off. They managed to climb up a 3,000-meter-class mountain and cross the ridge in a short time. According to Raidos’ geographical information obtained from Avenger, the southern part of the country was covered by mountains, and it seemed to be a long way around if they avoided the mountains and headed for the battlefield. So, we decided to go over the mountains, the quickest route to the battlefield.  We knew from the start that we would be quite reckless, but the valiant soldiers did not complain or be confused at all.  They just responded to Fran’s orders as usual, </p>
<p>「Yes!  Commander!  Curry!」</p>
<p>” They looked completely unimaginable for a few days in advance.  We couldn’t see the battlefield from the ridge of the mountain.  The only thing left to do was to go down, so we didn’t have to keep climbing the steep mountains for a long time. However, we had to keep descending the unstable rocky area.  Even so, the warriors moved forward with Fran in the lead.  Behind them were about 50 undead.  Not only the Genoside Ghouls, but also the skeleton eggs they created.  The rest were horses. It seemed that those who were not human beings were considered members of the troops if they willing to follow Fran.  The effect of the March of the Valkyrie was firmly exerted, also favoring the undead and horses. Therefore, they were climbing up the mountains in a place where horses would normally not be able to advance.  They used recovery magic to heal their legs and ran down the mountain in almost a straight line. There was a hilly area in front of them, and apparently, there was a fort near the end of it.  </p>
<p>(The battle has already begun)</p>
<p>『Yeah, we didn’t make it in time. But it’s not too late yet!』</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
<p>  The shouts of the two armies echoed through the hills, and the fierce battle began. Facing the presence of a battlefield, Fran looked back at the warriors.  </p>
<p>「Alignment!」</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Yes!  Commander!  Curry!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>「You guys are no longer less than the useless goblins we had when we left.  Now we can do our mission properly. A magnificent goblin」</p>
<p>『Not a goblin, but an adventurer!』</p>
<p>「Nn.  A honorable adventurer.  You don’t have to curry the tone anymore, and you’re able to do your best now」</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Yes!  captain!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>「I’m going to the battlefield now. But if we help each other properly, we can survive」</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Yes!  Commander!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>「Then, let’s go!  Save our comrades!」</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Yeah!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>『Don’t goblins there, just call them adventurers!』</p>
<p>「Nn. He’s a full-fledged adventurer now. So, you don’t have to put curry in the end of the conversation, and you’re able to do your best now」</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Yes! Commander!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>「We’re going to the battlefield now. But if we help each other properly, we can survive」</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Yes! Commander!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>「Then, let’s go! Save our comrades!」</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Yeah!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p> And so, Fran led a group of warriors and undead on the battlefield.</p>
