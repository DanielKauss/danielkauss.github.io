</div><h1>Chapter 1137</h1><p>(Hmm?)</p>
<p>『From the fort!』</p>
<p> The leader of the Zhu Flame Knights was obviously not going to stay put after all. A vermilion magic power was erupting from the rooftop of the fort. The magic power had a strong fire attribute that made me wonder if it was even heated from here. A young man stood in the center of that vermilion magic power. He looked just like Ionez, the vice-commander. A young man with a cheeky face, just like his younger brother? Twins? Anyway, there was no doubt that he had a blood connection. </p>
<p>『Fran, warn everyone!』</p>
<p>(Okay!)</p>
<p>  The opponent was the leader of the Red Knights, who was said to be the strongest.  I didn’t know what kind of attack she was going to attack. I braced myself while building up my magic so that I could deploy my barrier at any time.  Immediately afterward, the magic power on the rooftop suddenly soared as if it was going to explode.  The magic power then grew up like a pillar of vermilion flames. As if it had been burst one after another, several prominence-like fire arms ascended to the sky, and intertwined to create huge fire balls.  They were probably already about the size of a fort.  That thing was bad.  Moreover, an undead had appeared again. When I thought that the corpse of the battlefield had been enveloped in magic power, it was starting to rise one after another. </p>
<p>『We’ll have to ignore the undead and get them all down!』</p>
<p>  Maybe they’ll just ignore the undead and attack them. The Black Skeleton Corps and the Red Knights seemed to be in cahoots with good replenishment.  </p>
<p>「Donad!  This place’s dangerous!」</p>
<p>「Right!  Guys!  We’re pulling back! Leave the undead alone!」</p>
<p>「Guys!  Let’s get out of here!」</p>
<p>「Yes!  captain!」</p>
<p>「Avenger, come with me!」</p>
<p>「Mustaches! Please call me here to die!」</p>
<p>「Those who will not die!  You all stay with me!」</p>
<p>「Fuhahaha!  I understand!  My priestess!」</p>
<p>  I really wanted Fran to escape with her, but there was no way Fran would ever abandon the adventurers.  Thanks to this mission, Fran learned a sense of responsibility. She must have realized that she was a high-ranking adventurer.  That’s a good thing, but at times like this, she jumped into danger herself. It’s a complicated feeling. </p>
<p>『If it comes to it, we’ll just make a run for it, okay?』</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>  The adventurers immediately began to move, but the nobles’ troops were very slow to move. This had blocked the adventurers’ retreat.  </p>
<p>「What are you doing!?  Don’t go back down!」</p>
<p>「What are you saying!? You must be this far away from us!」</p>
<p>「You fools!  You can’t see that!」</p>
<p>「What are you afraid of at such a distance!?  You’re just like a timid! Are you embarrassed to be a person from the Kingdom of Kranzel!?」</p>
<p>  Tch! The nobles are way too stupid!  It seems that they have no experience in actual battle and think that attacks from the fort can’t be reached if they are this far away. But for the strong, it’s not close enough to be impossible to attack.  Besides, the nobles and their subordinates have not been able to perform so well.  Moreover, it was the words of the adventurers who looked down on them. This probably made them even more determined.  The captain of the knights joined in the persuasion, but the nobles were displeased. They were the ones who slammed into a fight for a second!  Donadrond must have realized that there was no point in arguing with them.  He then looked away from the nobles and gave the adventurers instructions again.  </p>
<p>「Ignore the idiots and bypass them! You don’t need to go out of your way to destroy them!」</p>
<p>「I-Impossible!  You!」</p>
<p>  The nobles were angry, but Donadrond completely ignored them.  The knight leader also seemed to follow Donadrond. Well, on the battlefield, disobeying the knight commander while he had the authority to order them is disobeying orders.  Some of the nobles, from seeing the knight leader’s behavior, must have understood that it was really dangerous.  Some of the nobles change their attitudes and begin to leave. The nobles who recognized Fran have been on the run from the beginning. In that case, the undead will lose their strength and will lose their balance, so the nobles eventually have no choice but to retreat...  It was a little too late.  </p>
<p>『Fran!  I’ll put up a barrier!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p> We saw a huge ball of fire created in the sky above the fort being launched towards us.  Fran and I used flame magic to put up barriers with all our might to protect the adventurers.  However, there were other adventurers who tried to protect us.  I could see double-layered light green barriers that overlapped the flame magic barrier we had created. Moreover, it was quite a wide area.  It seemed that Mareficent and the others were putting up such a barrier. I knew they were good at support, but I didn’t expect them to be able to put up barriers like this... As expected of a Rank A.  I guess Persona also had the power befitting her partner.  And then, a super fire ball, nearly thirty meters in diameter, landed.  The direct hit was not the adventurers who had already begun to leave the battlefield, but the remaining nobles. They probably couldn’t control their trajectory very well. We prepared for the huge explosion, but the shock wave that we were afraid of did not strike us.  Our barriers could only cover the adventurers and their surroundings. The tsunami of death, which ignited our bodies with a single touch, directly caused damage to a wide area.  Nearly thousands of soldiers turned into live torches, and overflowed flames attacked the adventurers at once. However, we, Mareficent, and the other magicians had made a barrier that managed to block them. Our magic power was being whittled down, but we managed to withstand it.  </p>
<p>『Guh!』</p>
<p>「Mwah!」</p>
<p>  The physical pressure was also a considerable burden.  However, there was reassuring support. The white light enveloped us and the magic power began to recover.  </p>
<p>「Nrgh!」</p>
<p>  Donadrond had activated the light again.  It was the Innate Skill of the Guardian, the </p>
<p>『Shimmering Spirit of the Guardian.』</p>
<p>.  I am really grateful for the slight auto-repair.  </p>
<p>『Just a little more!</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
