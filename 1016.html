</div><h1>Chapter 1016</h1><p>「Uuaaaaaaaaaaah!」</p>
<p>『I knew it!』</p>
<p>「But I can see it now!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p> After getting used to the speed of the giant antidemons, Fran and Seliadot began to avoid their attacks, although they didn’t have much leeway. </p>
<p>「Rah!」</p>
<p>「Black Lightning Princess! Over here!」</p>
<p> Fran and Seliadot continued to dodge, making full use of their evasive power and wards. On the other hand, the giant antidemons rarely dealt much damage. This may be a common fight against large magical beasts, but this time their opponent was too tough. Their fists, which had been half crushed by multiple Kanna Kamui, were even regenerated in a matter of seconds. Their fists, which had been crushed by multiple Kanna Kamui, were so regenerative that they could regenerate in a matter of seconds.  I also saw an endless increase in magic power. Even if there was an infinite supply of magic power from the outside, there was usually a limit to what magic power could be stored.  If Fran exceeded that, she would go out of control, her life force would begin to decrease, and her body would be affected. That was one of the causes of Fran’s self-destruction after using her strengthening abilities. However, the magic capacity of the giant antidemons seemed to be bottomless, and she continued to absorb more and more of what she had been fed.  She was probably much stronger than when she first appeared.  However, neither Fran nor Seliadot were depressed at all. It wouldn’t surprise me if they were depressed, but they continue to fight while maintaining their motivation.  I guess it was because they could see that reinforcements were steadily approaching. Well, for the transcendents of each unit, this distance was already within range.  A magic bullet flew from the first unit. It wasn’t that big, though―― Don’t!  The left arm of the giant antidemon was about to be deflected. That magic bullet seemed to be just as powerful as my Kanna Kamui multi-activation.  </p>
<p>『Tsk.  It’s a divine sword!』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p>  I recognize the magic power of that Divine Attribute.  It was Alpha, the Blade of Origin. I guess the one who fired the magic bullet now was the Divine Sword Knight Ader.  He was supported by us, but I can’t thank him frankly.  Fran seemed to feel the same way, and she was somewhat frustrated. After all, she didn’t have a good opinion of the Holy Nation.  A lot of black flashes erupted from the other side.  It must be the high-ranking dark magic that the magicians had unleashed. Anyway, thanks to Ader and the magicians, the huge antidemons were able to slow down their movements.  In the meantime, we were able to get a slight distance and prepare for our big move. Moreover, a reliable presence appeared rushing behind the giant antidemons.  </p>
<p>「Master!  Urushi!  Bring it all together!」</p>
<p>『Got it!』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「In the max power shock barrier!」</p>
<p>  At the same time, we unleashed our telekinesis and magic with all our might.  Seliadot seemed to have been thinking the same thing. She had activated the barrier as if she was pushing the back of the giant antidemon. And at the same time, a beautiful woman in light attire, clad in a dark green side pony, was giving the back of the giant antidemon a spectacular jump kick.  At the moment of impact, magic power was released from the woman’s back, creating a tremendous impact. Her back armor collapsed and even cracked.  Our attacks were also a push, and the giant antidemons had fallen to the ground almost tripping.  The roar and impact of an explosion as if they had exploded. The smoke and earth suddenly worsened our field of vision.  Even in such a situation, the woman did not lose her radiant appearance. A cheerful voice came down from the woman, who had been blocked by the recoil of a kick.  </p>
<p>「Sorry to keep you waiting, Fran.」</p>
<p>「Hilt!」</p>
<p> It was Hiltoria, the current head of the Dimitris school, who flew down the giant with a kick.  She must have come to the rescue on her own. He kicked the sky a few times in the recoil of his magic power, and landed next to Fran in a magnificent display.  </p>
<p>「A tremendously powerful antidemon.」</p>
<p>  Hilt said so, but the magic power released by her was also considerable.  Her entire body was covered in magic power from the divine attribute. She seems to be using the secret art of the Dimitris style, the dragon.  In the previous martial arts competitions, she must have only been able to unleash a single attack with the divine attribute. But now she can move with the dragon active. I guess that means Fran is not the only one who has grown on this continent. </p>
<p>「Even the wounds on her back are not going to be healed so easily.」</p>
<p>「Maybe, the Abyss Eater has given her magic power.」</p>
<p>「What the hell is that......?  You’re also with Isario-dono, right? Also, Trismegistus was nowhere to be seen......」</p>
<p>「... Dunno.」</p>
<p>  He looked at Fran with a raised eyebrows and shook her head, and somehow sensed what was going on.  Hiltoria saw the collapsed castle. </p>
<p>「Urooaaaah!」</p>
<p>「We’ll have to deal with this guy when we look for him.」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  Hiltoria glared at the huge antidemon about to get up and quietly set up.  Her left palm was opened and thrust forward, her right fist was folded to her side and pulled back. The lower half of her body was with her left in front, and her right leg was pulled back as if to get ready to kick the ground.  It was the so-called sei fist thrust stance.  </p>
<p>「Phew...... While the dragon ki is flowing around, I’ll give you one more blow.」</p>
<p>  The dragon ki that circulated through Hilt’s entire body seemed to be concentrated on her right fist. From there, what unfolded was the expected sei fist thrust.  Even though her fist did not reach, the dragon ki bullets that were released attacked the giant antidemons. The mass of dragon ki combined with a spiral turn was exactly what the bullets looked like and were so powerful. </p>
<p>「Aaagrhhh――!」</p>
<p>「Amazing!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  Hilt released a divine bullet, which exploded the head of the giant antidemon. The power that easily pierced through its thick barrier and outer shell was, as expected, a secret art of the Dimitris school. However, it was not a fatal wound for the giant antidemons and began to regenerate instantly.  </p>
<p>「Tsk.  Just like before, it easily regenerates even the dragonkin’s wounds.」</p>
<p>  Apparently, Hilt was the first time she had fought against an antidemon that was resistant to the divine attribute. A look of fatigue clearly showed in her face. In fact, it might be rare to have a resistance that can immediately regenerate damage from the divine attribute.  </p>
<p>「Hilt, are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Don’t worry, you’re still okay.」</p>
<p>  Her magic power has diminished considerably, but she seems to be unable to move. However, she was probably not enough to perform a series of large moves.  Besides, we were not able to eliminate the huge antidemons, but we managed to buy her a lot of time. Her movements were slow during regeneration, and she fell down unable to support her weight again.  In the meantime, others had arrived.  </p>
<p>「Fran! Are you safe?」</p>
<p>「Colbert!」</p>
<p>  Colbert, who was at the head of the group, dashed over to us.  He was clearly stronger than when we parted ways.  This meant that his level and skill had increased during his series of battles with the antidemon’s forces. His presence has increased a notch.  </p>
<p>「Miss Hilt...  please don’t rush all by yourself!」</p>
<p>「That’s what saved Fran, so it’s okay!」</p>
<p>「Well, that’s true, but...... If Miss Hilt dies, our school will be over, you know?」</p>
<p>「It’s not going to let you die so easily.  It’s a matter of worry.」</p>
<p>「Who’s it because of?」</p>
<p>「Hmph.」</p>
<p>  As usual, it exuded a sweet and sullen atmosphere! Hilt poisoned Colbert’s scolding, but it looked like a wholehearted exchange between lovers.  Colbert didn’t seem to be in a mess either, huh? Could it be that they were getting along as well?  I-Is this what kind of suspension bridge effect this is?  Oh crap! Don’t you train your love on the battlefield!? </p>
<p>(Master?)</p>
<p>『Do-don’t mind me!  More importantly, the bastard of Adar will come over there.  Soon, the people of the Holy Nation will come too. Are the bracelets disguised as well?』</p>
<p>(Nn. But this didn’t work on Trismegistus.)</p>
<p>『The dragonkin and her friends had a lot of specialization, and I think they’ll get even stronger in the castle...... Besides, they weren’t able to see it completely』</p>
<p>  He seemed to have some idea of the factors that made up my interior and the systemic parts of me. However, the relationship between Fenrir and his growth potential didn’t seem to be visible.  That may be because of the disguised bracelet. Well, it has been effective on appraisers in the Holy Nation before, so I’m sure it will be no problem this time as well.  </p>
<p>「Ad-――」</p>
<p>「Move!」</p>
<p> Ader rushed toward us and ran straight through.  </p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>『We rushed in without exchanging any information.  Something’s up with us.』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p>  No, does he want to defeat the giant antidemons as soon as possible to break the open state? Maybe that’s just how harsh the condition of the Ader is.  In fact, they move a little slower than before.</p>
<p>「Adventurers――」</p>
<p>「Moves!」</p>
<p> When I thought Ader had dashed over to us, he ran straight through. </p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>『We rushed in without exchanging any information. Something’s upsetting.』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p> No, is he really trying to defeat the giant antidemons with brute force, so that he can break out of the released state quickly? Maybe that’s just how harsh the condition of the Ader is. In fact, they move a little slower than before. Their level seemed to be quite low.</p>
