</div><h1>Chapter 1016</h1><p>「Uuaaaaaaaaahhh!」</p>
<p>『She’s really fast!』</p>
<p>「But I can see it now!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Fran and Urushi, who had gotten used to the speed of the giant antidemons, were not able to afford to take it, but they were beginning to evade its attacks.</p>
<p>「Rhaa!」</p>
<p>「Black Lightning Princess! Over here!」</p>
<p>Fran and Seliadot continued to dodge using evasive power and wards. On the other hand, the giant antidemons barely managed to respond at all.</p>
<p>This may be a common scene against large magic beasts, but this time their opponent was too tough. They had high regenerative power, and even managed to regenerate their fist, which was half shattered by multiple Kanna Kamui, in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>I also felt an endless surge of magic power. Even if there was an infinite supply of magic power from the outside, there was usually a limit to the amount of magic power I could store.</p>
<p>If she exceeded that, she would go berserk, and her life force would begin to decrease, which would affect her body. That was one of the reasons why Fran was on the verge of self-destruction after using her strengthening abilities.</p>
<p>However, it seemed that the magic capacity of the giant antidemons was bottomless, and it continued to absorb as much as it was fed.</p>
<p>He’s probably much stronger than when he first appeared.</p>
<p>But neither Fran nor Seliadot was depressed at all. It wouldn’t be surprising if they were depressed, but they were still fighting while maintaining their motivation.</p>
<p>I guess it was because we could feel the reinforcements steadily approaching us.</p>
<p>But for the transcendents of each unit, this distance was already within range.</p>
<p>A magic bullet came from the first unit. It wasn’t very big, but――</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The left arm of the giant antidemon that was about to unleash a cleave was shattered. That one shot of magic was equivalent to my Kanna Kamui multiple activations.</p>
<p>『Tsk. That’s a Divine Sword!』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p>I remember that Divine Attribute magic power. It was Alpha, the Blade of Origin. I guess Addle, the Divine Sword Knight, was the one who fired the magic bullet now.</p>
<p>They gave us a lot of support, but I can’t thank them frankly. Fran seemed to feel the same way, and she felt somewhat frustrated. After all, she doesn’t have a good feeling for the Holy Nation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from the other side, a series of black flashes of light appeared. It was probably the high-level dark magic that the magicians had fired. They had broken through the barrier of the giant antidemons and shook its huge body.</p>
<p>Was it the magic circle of the magic kingdom that was capable of unleashing so much magic? Anyway, thanks to Addle and the sorceress, the giant antidemons were able to slow down its movements.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we were able to keep a small distance and prepare for our big move.</p>
<p>Moreover, a reliable presence appeared rushing toward us behind the giant antidemons.</p>
<p>「Master! Urushi! Let’s do this!」</p>
<p>『I’m on it!』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Max power output shock barrier!」</p>
<p>We unleashed telekinesis and magic at the same time. Seems like Seliadot was thinking the same thing too. She activated the ward as if she was pushing the back of a giant antidemon.</p>
<p>A shadow leapt into the air at the same time.</p>
<p>「Teryaaaaah!」</p>
<p>A beautiful woman in light outfit, with a dark green side pony fluttering around, was giving the giant antidemons a spectacular jump kick on the back.</p>
<p>At the moment of impact, magic power was released from the woman’s back, creating a tremendous impact. The armor on her back even collapsed and cracked.</p>
<p>Our attacks gave them a boost, as the giant antidemons collapsed to the ground at a crawl. A roar and impact, as if an explosion had occurred at the bomb. The smoke billowing from the blast rapidly worsened our field of view.</p>
<p>In the midst of all this, Fran still maintained her figure shining brightly by the magic power she wore. A cheerful voice came from the woman who was still aloof from the backlash of kicking.</p>
<p>「Sorry to keep you waiting, Fran.」</p>
<p>「Hilt!」</p>
<p>It was Hiltoria, the current head of the Dimitris school, who sent the giant down with a jump.</p>
<p>He must have come alone to rescue us in advance.</p>
<p>After kicking the sky a few times with the recoil of her magic power, she landed gracefully next to Fran.</p>
<p>「That’s an antidemon with tremendous power.」</p>
<p>The amount of magic power that Hilt released was also tremendous. Her entire body was covered in divine attribute mana. It seemed that she was using a dragon, the secret art of the Dimitris school.</p>
<p>In the past martial arts tournaments, she could only fire a single attack with the divine attribute. But now she can move with the dragon active.</p>
<p>I guess it’s not just Fran who has grown up on this continent.</p>
<p>「Even the wounds on your back are not gonna heal easily too」</p>
<p>「Maybe, I’m getting magic power from the Abyss Eater」</p>
<p>「What the hell is that...... Also, you must have been with Isario-dono, right? And I also don’t seem to see Trismegistus either......」</p>
<p>「......Dunno.」</p>
<p>「Yeah.」</p>
<p>He looked at Fran, who was shaking her head with a frown, and somehow figured out what was going on. Hiltoria saw the collapsed castle. But that was only for a moment.</p>
<p>「Uroaaaaaah!」</p>
<p>「We’ll have to do something about this guy when we look for him」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Hiltoria then glared at the giant antidemon about to get up and stood quietly.</p>
<p>She opens her left palm and thrusts forward, and folds her right fist to her side and squeezes it. Her lower body faces her left, and her right leg pulls back to get ready to kick the ground.</p>
<p>It was the so-called orthodox fist thrust stance.</p>
<p>「Phew......... I’ll give you one more shot as the dragon ki rolls around.」</p>
<p>I could see the dragon ki circulating all over Hilt’s body concentrating on her right fist. What came out of it was just as expected, an orthodox fist thrust.</p>
<p>Even though her fists could not reach them, the dragon ki bullets released attacked the giant antidemons. The mass of dragon ki that had been spun in a spiral motion was exactly what a bullet was, in terms of appearance and power.</p>
<p>「Aaagrhhhh――!」</p>
<p>「Amazing!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Hilt released a Divine Attribute and blasted the head of the giant antidemon. The power that easily pierced through its thick barrier and outer shell was truly the secret of the Dimitris style.</p>
<p>However, it was not a fatal wound for the giant antidemons and began to regenerate immediately.</p>
<p>「Tch. Just like before, it can regenerate dragonkin’s wounds more easily」</p>
<p>Apparently, Hilt had never fought against an antidemon that was resistant to the divine attribute before. She had fought several high-level antidemons up until now, but they would not regenerate if defeated with the divine attribute.</p>
<p>A surprise appeared on her exhausted face.</p>
<p>Several times since Nadia’s rescue, we’ve encountered antidemons that didn’t even know about the divine attribute, but it seems all the higher tier antidemons don’t.</p>
<p>Rather, it might be rare to find a resistance that can immediately regenerate damage caused by the divine attribute.</p>
<p>「Hilt, are you okay?」</p>
<p>「I’ll be fine. Not yet」</p>
<p>It had considerably less magic power, but it didn’t seem to be worn out enough to be able to move yet. However, it was probably not enough to be able to fire a series of big moves.</p>
<p>Moreover, we were not able to destroy the giant antidemons, but we managed to buy them a lot of time. They slowed down during regeneration, and fell again unable to support their weight.</p>
<p>In the meantime, others had arrived.</p>
<p>「Fran! Are you safe?」</p>
<p>「Colbert!」</p>
<p>Colbert, who was at the head of the group, dashed over to us. He was clearly stronger than when we parted. This meant that his level and skills had increased in the series of battles with the antidemon army. The presence he radiated has increased a notch.</p>
<p>「Miss Hilt, please don’t rush in alone!」</p>
<p>「That was enough to save Fran, so that’s good to hear!」</p>
<p>「Regrettably though...... If you die, our school will be over, right?」</p>
<p>「It’s not gonna be easy to die. I’m worried.」</p>
<p>「Who’s that?」</p>
<p>「Hmph.」</p>
<p>It was as sweet and sullen as ever! In contrast to Colbert’s scoldings, Hilt poisoned it, but it looked like a exchange of lovers.</p>
<p>Colbert also doesn’t seem to be in a bad mood, huh? Could it be that the two have grown closer?</p>
<p>T-This must be the effect of the suspension bridge, huh? That damn! You shouldn’t be training your love on the battlefield!</p>
<p>(Master?)</p>
<p>『Anything! More importantly, there’s going to be Ader’s bastard over there. The people from the Holy Nation will be here soon. So, they have well disguised bracelets, huh?』</p>
<p>(Nn. But this didn’t work on Trismegistus)</p>
<p>『It seems the dragonkin had a strong special ability to look at things, so they’d be strengthened in the castle...... Besides, they couldn’t seem to be able to see them completely, huh?』</p>
<p>She seemed to have some idea of the factors that make up me and the system within me. However, it seemed that she couldn’t seem to understand the relationship between Fenrir and my growth potential.</p>
<p>Maybe that was thanks to the disguised bracelets. Well, it seemed that they had worked well against the appraisers of the Holy Nation before, so this time, it wouldn’t be a problem either.</p>
<p>「Advert――」</p>
<p>「Mock!」</p>
<p>Just when I thought Ader had dashed over to us, he continued to run.</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>『They went in without even exchanging any information. Something is making me feel rushed』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p>No. Was she going to defeat the giant antidemons quickly to break the free state? Maybe that’s just how harsh the situation in Adel was.</p>
<p>In fact, he moved a little slower than before. He seemed to be at a much lower level.</p>
