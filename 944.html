</div><h1>Chapter 944</h1><p>As we looked down at the plaza from the top of the walls, we saw a hydrangea and a Japanese snowman in a carriage. It seemed that they were the ones who were in the carriage of General Hagane’s country.</p>
<p>Who was the wielder of the Berserk? Both the hydrangea and the mantis? Considering that the wielder would die, it was likely that they already had several people they could use.</p>
<p>So they were a sacrifice to the Divine Sword huh? I don’t want to get Fran involved with them too much. Just because she’s going to die doesn’t mean that there’s no point in our relationship with them.</p>
<p>In fact, Fran and the Hydrangea seemed to be a good match. They might be able to become close friends with each other.</p>
<p>But it meant that the pain from losing it would only make the wound deeper and wider.</p>
<p>I didn’t want Fran to get hurt.</p>
<p>It might be already too late though. In the short time that had passed before, Fran seemed to have felt some kind of sympathy for the hydrangea.</p>
<p>As I looked at the wagon with mixed feelings, General Hagane’s troops began to move. The wagon was surrounded by black spearmen and began to move slowly.</p>
<p>Apparently, he was planning to pull them up from this square.</p>
<p>Should we not welcome Silard’s troops? Countries that were not on good terms with each other are likely to have a fight over such small details.</p>
<p>Well, it looked like we were bad at taking him in, so I guess she purposely decided to pull him up first.</p>
<p>The holy knight of Silard appeared in the square, where the troops of General Hagane had disappeared and had grown wider. It was greeted by cheering citizens.</p>
<p>The holy knights waved their hands lightly and responded, but the vital Divine Sword Knight Ader was slow to move. He was walking with his legs slightly dragging, without even turning around. Walking on his own was probably the end of the day. He seemed to be exhausted no matter where I look at it.</p>
<p>Since it was said that it could use the Divine Sword Release for a long time, I assumed that it had little backlash.</p>
<p>But it seemed that was not the case. It was different from what was possible. If they were to use it for a short time and it was exhausted, they would die if they used it for hours.</p>
<p>That’s enough to make me think that the academy is in perfect sync.</p>
<p>(Addle looks spicy.)</p>
<p>『Do you think so, Fran?』</p>
<p>(Nn. It’s too weak to be a Divine Sword?)</p>
<p>『Oh, I see. Maybe that’s true.』</p>
<p>It seems that in order to draw out the best of her Divine Sword’s power, Addle is prioritizing the acquisition of skills. Even though she was training, there was probably a difference between her and Ashwrath and Isario.</p>
<p>Because of this, they may not be able to endure the backlash of the Divine Sword. The country knows that? If so, is Ader being treated as a disposable too?</p>
<p>『Hmmm. In this big country, there might be a lot of dirty truths behind it』</p>
<p>Maybe she even created a few warriors like Adel that would let the next one use the divine sword when he died.</p>
<p>『Next time, I wanted to see how Berserk is activated......』</p>
<p>(......Don’t look at it.)</p>
<p>『Is that so?』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>The use of Berserk meant that the hydrangea would die. It was not that she had become a friend of Fran’s, but she still thought that she didn’t want the hydrangea to die.</p>
<p>As we watched Adors from the top of the walls, we heard some screams.</p>
<p>On closer inspection, I saw several civilians stuck in their asses as if they had been thrust away. Apparently, they had gotten too close to the holy knights.</p>
<p>The holy knights seemed to be highly conscious of their chosen people, and would do anything terrible if commoners approached them. However, the atmosphere flowing through them was much more lethal than I had imagined.</p>
<p>You could even say that she had killing intent.</p>
<p>In fact, not only the holy knights who had thrust away the onlookers, but even the knights around them were touching the hilt of the sword.</p>
<p>If the civilians moved badly, they would be discarded. The presence of the holy knights was so tremendous that it became clear that they were no longer a threat.</p>
<p>They were trying to intimidate ordinary citizens with the presence of an enemy there.</p>
<p>「W-What are you doing!?」</p>
<p>「Shut up! If you get any closer, I’ll cut you down! You’ll disappear!」</p>
<p>「We-We’re just...」</p>
<p>「He said we should disappear. Is that what you want us to do?」</p>
<p>In the end, the holy knights’ attitude did not soften, and the frightened onlookers scattered as if to escape. The holy knights continued to watch on their backs without a care in the world.</p>
<p>At first, I thought they were a bit overkill, but soon I started to think of the reason for their caution. They were guarding Ader, who had been worn out by the Divine Sword Release and whose movements were slowing down.</p>
<p>After all, he was a wielder of a divine sword. There was no reason for him to be targeted for his life. I’m sure he knew more than a hundred people, not just the fingers on both hands.</p>
<p>This was the perfect opportunity to target the Adel. They knew this too, so they were wary of it.</p>
<p>The reason why General Hagane left the square was probably to avoid causing a unnecessary commotion with Silard in this state.</p>
<p>It was General Hagane who had the most potential for them to target their lives after all. The General Hagane side understood that they were suspected.</p>
<p>The civilians who had been making a scene moved away with an annoyed look on their faces. The holy knights, too, had an annoyed look on their faces, but they didn’t apologize. Their popularity was important, but Adar’s safety was probably the most important.</p>
<p>『It seems we should get closer too. It’s also better to tell the adventurers not to get too close to the other adventurers』</p>
<p>「Okay」</p>
<p>After all, they’re just going to get into trouble against a stupid adventurer or a holy knight after all. I didn’t think this was a joke for Silard right now.</p>
<p>If any one of them dies, they will no longer be able to retreat.</p>
