</div><h1>Chapter 1088</h1><p>The reward for completing the mission. It is to return to the cycle of reincarnation on Earth with a little favor. The main idea was that I would be promised a rose life full of talent and luck. And now I would disappear. There was surprisingly no fear about that. Wasn’t it because she was going to die? Or was it because the Gods were doing something to avoid being afraid? But what was important to me was not about me myself. But it was not about me myself that was important.  </p>
<p>『What will happen to the sword now when I return to the reincarnation ring?』</p>
<p>「My kin will take over the rest.  Heavenly Wolf Sword, Fenrir.  That will be my new name」</p>
<p>『Eh? Fenrir-san, wasn’t it possible to be resurrected?』</p>
<p>「It’s only that the separation from the Evil God’s soul is over, and it’s not a complete resurrection.  It will still be necessary to accumulate more power for a while.  However, with the soul’s separation, it is possible to protect Fenrir and those who are called Evil Gods separately. And the rest is in our territory」</p>
<p>『But still trapped inside the sword?』</p>
<p> Is it a Divine Sword?』</p>
<p>「Yes, that’s right」</p>
<p> A Divine Sword huh...?  I’m sure it’s stronger. Fran will be in even more fierce battles in the future to lift the curse placed on the Black Cat kin. For her, the Divine Sword should be a great help.  She might be able to fight with pieces of the Evil God on her own. It might be more reliable to leave it to Fenrir-san to make Fran’s wishes come true. But still―― </p>
<p>『Will she have to definitely return to the cycle of reincarnation on Earth?』</p>
<p>「What do you mean?」</p>
<p>『That’s why I have to go back to Earth, right?』</p>
<p>「Forget everything, I’ll be reincarnated on Earth.  Does that mean you’re unhappy? I promised you a life without any restrictions in your next life, you know?」</p>
<p>  The Goddess of the Silver Moon was confused. Apparently, for the Gods, a favored next life was a rather tempting reward.  Well, I thought it was an tempting reward for me right after I died on Earth too. But not for me right now.  The Goddess of Chaos seems to know how I feel.  She was smirking. I wonder if the Goddess of the Underworld understands too?  Maybe there’s a difference in whether or not there are many people in this area.  The Goddess of the Silver Moon doesn’t understand human feelings, or rather, it tries to understand, but it doesn’t seem to be able to understand. Even so, it’s probably much better than the other merciless Gods.  </p>
<p>『I’m Fran’s master and partner.  I can’t abandon Fran and be reincarnated by myself. Can I somehow stay in this world?』</p>
<p>「Ara?  But this is your chance to get a Divine Sword, right?  What do you think, Fran?」</p>
<p>  The Goddess of Chaos asked me in a teasing tone.  But the answer was fixed.  </p>
<p>『I’m sure she’ll be happy. Even if you get a Divine Sword, if it’s not me, Fran will be sad』</p>
<p>「Ufufu, you’re right.  That girl might be. But when I hear you’re going to be reincarnated happy, I’m sure she’ll be happy to send me out, right?」</p>
<p>『Maybe so.  But that’s not the case.  I want to stay in this world because I want to be next to Fran.  I’m not rejecting it because I want to forget everything and make only I happy.  Rather than the happiness of the next life, being with Fran now is more happy for me! So, I’ll stay in this world!』</p>
<p>  I’m Fran’s partner.  I watch over Fran’s whereabouts and live with her. Everything else is trivial.  </p>
<p>「I understand what you want to stay here.  But what about Fenrir?  He’s the days when he’ll be coming out of the fold and is trapped as your second personality, you know?」</p>
<p>『Hmm...  That’s...』</p>
<p> To be honest, I hadn’t thought about that. I see, the fact that I’m going to stay means that Fenrir-san will sleep again...  </p>
<p>『Will you be able to put me in a different storage? It doesn’t matter what kind of small fry weapon I have as long as I can stay here!』</p>
<p>「God!  I’ll leave it to you too」</p>
<p>『Eh?  Fenrir-san?』</p>
<p> To my surprise, Fenrir-san also began to bow his head to the Gods.  </p>
<p>「Master and Fran are no longer strangers to me.  I’m not going to be tired of sleeping in the sword again. Could you please take care of it so that Master can stay in this world?」</p>
<p>『But then, Fenrir-san...』</p>
<p>「Anyway, I won’t be able to stay outside the sword until I’m resurrected.  So, it doesn’t change for me to sleep for a while.  Besides, Master and Fran are no longer strangers to me.  My wish was for them. So, please, Goddess...!」</p>
<p>『I-I’m begging you!』</p>
<p>  Fenrir-san and I then bowed our heads. Then the Goddess of the Underworld opened their mouths as if saying that they were irritated.  </p>
<p>「If you refuse here, you will never be able to return to Earth’s reincarnation again. Are you sure?」</p>
<p>『As long as you can stay by Fran’s side, that’s fine』</p>
<p>「This reward is just a power of reincarnation.  It can’t be converted into another power and given to you. You will be completely unrewarded, are you okay?」</p>
<p>『Yes.  Announcer-san, Fran, Urushi, and Fenrir-san. It’s like a reward for me to be able to meet my friends』</p>
<p>「... I see.  I will allow you to stay here like this」</p>
<p>「Me too. We still need you to wield chaos」</p>
<p>「...My kin, are you sure that’s okay?」</p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>「Understood.  Then, I’ll stop execution of the reward and maintain the status quo」</p>
<p>「Aah, but I’ll have to mess with the system a little.  At this rate, Master’s growth will stop here. I’ll continue to absorb his magic stones and change the system to make Master stronger」</p>
<p>『T-Thank you very much! Is it okay to do that much?』</p>
<p>「Yeah! Because that makes it more interesting!」</p>
<p>『Aah, that’s why...』</p>
<p>  But I was really grateful to her.</p>
<p>「Ufufu.</p>
<p>「Ufufu. We’ll have a good chaos from now on...」</p>
