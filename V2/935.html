</div><h1>Chapter 935</h1><p>「Miss Hilt... Can Uncle get a plate for me too?」</p>
<p>「...Nn」</p>
<p> The Divine Sword man, of course, showed no hostility towards us and took a dish with normal grilled meat on it. There was no reason for him to antagonize us. He looked like a plain old dude with a medium-sized meat that looked like he was just anywhere. He had gray hair that looked like he was in his forties and a slightly dark stubble beard that looked like he was cutting through something. He was a little cat-like and had a strangely smug look on his face. He was a little cat-like and had a strange look on his face.  I mean, he was like a salaryman after all-night work, maybe? Or was it a middle-ranking officer who was forced to solve difficult problems? They seemed to be adored by a man, but the woman seemed to be avoiding them.  She was acting in a bewilderment when Fran was staring at her.  And she soon came to the conclusion of that reason. They smirked and opened their mouths.  </p>
<p>「Hou.  Did you find out what my sword was?」</p>
<p>「...Sh-sheh――」</p>
<p>「Oh, don’t tell me what’s up ahead.  I won’t be able to eat meat peacefully」</p>
<p>  So, this was really a Divine Sword.  Fran’s gaze turned to the man’s waist.  It looked like a rather flashy long sword.  It had a red gem embedded in its hilt and its brim was red. However, despite its appearance, it was strangely unobtrusive.  Or rather, she was receiving a plain heart.  In the first place, it was strange that the people around her didn’t give any attention to the man. Fran finally realized that.  She looked around and tilted her head at the man. But to Fran, the man picked up his cloak lightly and told us in a whisper.  </p>
<p>「A cloak that inhibits perception.  It’s a powerful guy that an acquaintance made for you.  You can tell that he’s quite powerful just by noticing me」</p>
<p>  It seems that his cloak was a magic tool.  He doesn’t seem to be able to deceive someone who was more than a certain level, but his constant line of defense seems to be quite high. After all, no adventurer had noticed this man other than Fran.  Fran interrupted the sound with silence and asked another question. The man answered with a wry smile, as if he could tell the effect of magic at first sight.  </p>
<p>「Is that, a Divine Sword?」</p>
<p>「Just as the lady saw it.  It’s the Fire Sword Ignis」</p>
<p>「That’s right.  I’ve become so famous that even the kids from outside have become famous, uncle」</p>
<p>  Was it really Isario!? I never thought I’d meet him in Nocta. When I learned that he was a Rank S adventurer, I wondered why the timid and salary-like atmosphere of a trading company seemed to be relaxed because of his strong personality or something like that.  </p>
<p>「I’m Isario, an adventurer with a divine sword. I don’t know if he’s skilled or incompetent, but you can call him any way you want」</p>
<p>「S-ranked adventurer?」</p>
<p>「My alias」</p>
<p> A Rank S adventurer is not talented...  What do you mean?  Isario reached out his hand while shrugging his shoulders as Fran tilted her head.  A handshake――but that’s not the case.  With his palms up, he was clearly begging for meat.  </p>
<p>「Give me the meat.  Do you want a big portion?」</p>
<p>「......If you have a mock battle, I’ll make a big portion」</p>
<p>  Fran, you’re just holding back so much! She thought it was a good opportunity, but she simply turned him down.  </p>
<p>「It’s meat now!  And drink!」</p>
<p>「You can have meat and alcohol at any time」</p>
<p>「Miss Hilt, the money will be transferred to the guild this time.  That means you won’t be paying for the meat. Isario shouted a mischievous line with a sharp expression on his face. I thought it was a little cool, but he looked like a full-fledged adventurer who had drunk it.  </p>
<p>「I don’t know」</p>
<p>「It was too early for you, huh?  But it’s not as good as a free drink, you know? Besides, you’d better not let it get away from here, right?」</p>
<p>  Certainly, we needed to use this training area to have a mock battle. We would be in the way of a large party.  </p>
<p>「... So, what’s tomorrow?」</p>
<p>「I’ve got a request for tomorrow, so I won’t let you」</p>
<p>「Just a little in the morning?」</p>
<p>「You’ll get tired if you do a mock battle before a request, right? You’ll have to challenge yourself in perfect condition, so that’s not possible」</p>
<p>「... Is that so?」</p>
<p> Isario’s words were probably too correct to say anything to him. Fran then fell silent in frustration.  </p>
<p>『Fran, give him the letter of introduction you’ve given us.』</p>
<p>「I also have a letter of introduction.」</p>
<p>「Oh?  It’s from Diaz-san, right...  Okay, but it’s impossible for me right now. Well, it’ll be too soon.」</p>
<p>「Promised.」</p>
<p>「Okay.  When the antidemon season is over?  Besides, what’s with me? </p>
<p>「?  You’re a Rank S adventurer, right?」</p>
<p>「It’s just a Dandy with a divine sword.」</p>
<p>  I don’t know if she’s a Dandy or not, but she just has a divine sword? Isn’t she anything serious herself?  The flame sword is a divine sword in the same system as Ashwrath’s Gaia. Moreover, if it was a Divine Sword of Flame with high attack power, it would be quite a fighting force.  As long as she could master the Divine Sword, even if she was a little weaker, she might be able to become a Rank S adventurer. However, this man didn’t look like an adventurer who only had the power of a divine sword.  However, he didn’t seem to be humble. Isario seemed to really think that he didn’t have anything serious. </p>
<p>「Did you?」</p>
<p>「... No, it’s nothing.  See ya」</p>
<p> Isario smiled bitterly at the end and disappeared between the adventurers.  </p>
<p>(I couldn’t promise a mock battle with him)</p>
<p>『Well, he’s an S-ranked adventurer after all. It’s no wonder he’s so busy』</p>
<p>(Nn...)</p>
<p> But he’s apparently a common sense person compared to the Beast King and Dimitris, and I think he’ll keep his word.</p>
<p>「Damn?」</p>
<p>「......No, it’s nothing. See ya, young miss again.」</p>
<p> Isario smiled bitterly at the end and disappeared among the adventurers. </p>
<p>(I couldn’t promise a mock battle)</p>
<p>『Well, he’s an S-ranked adventurer after all. It’s no wonder he’s so busy』</p>
<p>(Nn......)</p>
<p> But he’s apparently a common sense person compared to the Beast King and Dimitris, and I think he’ll keep his word. Well, he looks pretty damn strong just because he’s not even close to the Beast King and Dimitris though.</p>
