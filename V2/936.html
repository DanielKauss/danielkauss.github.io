</div><h1>Chapter 936</h1><p>The morning after the big party was over, we went down to the training area from the guild’s lodgings and found a series of adventurers lying on the ground. </p>
<p>「Jeez.」</p>
<p> Fran frowned as she clutched her nose. </p>
<p>『The smell of the wine is amazing.』</p>
<p> Even after Fran left for the bed room, she was still enjoying her booze. I don’t know who this guy was, but how could he even sleep on three floors? Moreover, there were a group of people who were still booze. In the center of it was Isario, the adventurer with a divine sword. At the center of them was Isario, the adventurer who was carrying a divine sword.  </p>
<p>「Drink!」</p>
<p>「Uhahahaha!」</p>
<p>「You can’t let me do that!」</p>
<p>「I don’t know what you’re saying!」</p>
<p>「Gyahahaha!」</p>
<p>  That was amazing.  There were nearly 30 liquor bottles lying around at his feet, but Isario didn’t seem to be drunk. Even though the other adventurers were about to get crushed, he was still slightly sick.  Is this the ability of a Rank S adventurer? I’ve heard that even if you get stronger, you’ll be drunk with alcohol.  Will alcohol resolution increase as your stats increase?  The sight of him laughing stupidly as he drank alcohol looked like a middle-aged guy wrapping a tube in a tavern. It reminded me of my boss who was in the department before my reincarnation.  The adventurers around me didn’t seem to be aware of Isario.  It must be the effect of his cloak. Well, maybe he was just too drunk to distinguish between people.  Or rather, he didn’t say something like, “Let’s challenge the request in perfect condition”?  No matter how I look at it, he doesn’t look like he was in perfect condition. Fran thought so too, and approached Isario and Zelos Reed.  </p>
<p>「Hey」</p>
<p>「Ooh!  The meat girl!」</p>
<p>  Even Isario was recognized by “The meat girl! ” But Fran didn’t seem to care.  Rather, her face looked somewhat smug, maybe? She must think of this as a noble meaning to someone who rules over the wonderful being of the meat.  </p>
<p>「He said that she would go on a request in perfect condition, so no mock battles」</p>
<p>「Ou! </p>
<p>「Is he in perfect condition?」</p>
<p>  Rather than being angry, it must be more of a question. Fran, who didn’t drink, didn’t understand that she was in a drunk state.  </p>
<p>「You’re right.  I’m a little more empowered by being drunk!  So, I’m in better shape than I am now!」</p>
<p>「I see」</p>
<p>  A lie!  It’s a lie!  It’s completely a joke for a drinker!  Don’t believe it!  Isario...  It was a completely useless guy! Who among the S-ranked adventurers is a honor student!?  </p>
<p>「How about a little girl?」</p>
<p>「Hmmm」</p>
<p>  Fran!  Hmmm!  </p>
<p>「Drink is delicious?」</p>
<p>「That’s delicious!  You’ve never drunk one? That’s why uncle thinks that he’s 99% guilty of his life!」</p>
<p>  Normally, he doesn’t say half of his life, right? But it’s only half of his life!  </p>
<p>『It’s no good!』</p>
<p>「... Just for a minute」</p>
<p>『No good!  No good!』</p>
<p>「Uhahaha!  Drink too much! I could taste the liquor when I was five!」</p>
<p>『Kuh! Have this!』</p>
<p>  Fran’s gaze shook between me and the cup I was holding out by Isario.  The glutton Fran was probably interested in liquor. Besides, liquors were a good idea to be an adventurer.  She must want to be able to drink in order to become the ideal adventurer. But, it was no good!  After all, we couldn’t let the current Fran taste the wine, except for the situation where she only had something to drink. What should we do now that she started to like it and drink too much!  When this happens, would we have no choice but to go with the hardline method of telekinesis?  Just when I was about to start thinking about it.  </p>
<p>「Oi! You son of a bitch!」</p>
<p>「Woof?  Who are you?」</p>
<p>「I’m a C-ranked adventurer, Zvalve!」</p>
<p>「Molly!」</p>
<p>「Wazzleen!」</p>
<p>「Blunt the bastard to make a name for yourself!  Get prepared!」</p>
<p>  It was a brutal fight, so I thought she would apply for a mock battle, but without any further talk, she pulled out her weapon. It seemed that it was a reward for her achievement. If they could beat an S-ranked adventurer, they would certainly become famous, but isn’t that pretty reckless?  With two of their friends in the D-rank class, I don’t think they could beat a Divine Sword user very well. However, it seemed that even these guys had a chance of winning.  </p>
<p>「Even an S ranker will be able to defeat me in drunk! I’ve got this!」</p>
<p>  Isario’s face is definitely red, and he’s clearly drunk. But is that gonna be the winner?  The battle that had suddenly begun was met with cheers in the training area. Instead of helping Isario, she began to enjoy this battle as a snack.  Rather than being heartless, no one seemed to be thinking that Isario would lose. </p>
<p>「Isario’s husband, when was he here?」</p>
<p>「Congratulations, I was drinking with him」</p>
<p>「Aah, that was my husband huh?」</p>
<p>「I didn’t even notice it because I was drunk!」</p>
<p>「Even though he’s not wearing anything, I can see through your husband’s disguise!」</p>
<p>「You son of a bitch!」</p>
<p>  Fran went down to the wall to take a look at him.  </p>
<p>『That axe user. Quite strong.』</p>
<p>(Nn.  He’s not bad.)</p>
<p>  He didn’t have any magic or scouting skills, but his weapon-based combat skills were not that great.  I also had skills like Brain Muscle, but also intuition and perception. I guess he saw the concealment effect of Isario’s cloak.  Isario flinched as he slashed at her with a shout. His shoulders shrugged and he shook his head.  </p>
<p>「Good job, I was drinking so much fun.  But suddenly, aren’t you? If you’re going to apologize now, I’ll do something you didn’t get to do.」</p>
<p>「Keh.  You’re a Rank S because you’re so smug and slacking when someone slashes you!  Even if it’s on the continent of death, you’re only in this world after all!」</p>
<p>「Haah.  You guys kept going pretty far...  I guess it can’t be helped.  I wouldn’t be able to get away from being made fun of by other adventurers, not to mention me.I was expecting to see the battle of an S-ranked adventurer.</p>
