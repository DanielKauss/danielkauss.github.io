</div><h1>Chapter 975</h1><p>We were now facing the giant-type of shorz, but a new giant-type was approaching us. It was running at a tremendous pace from the west.</p>
<p>「You?」</p>
<p>「I’ll be late if I wait that long for her!」</p>
<p>『Yeah!』</p>
<p>It seemed that it would take some more time for the completion of the ritual spell by General Hagane. Isario was completely dependent on that giant-type of shorz.</p>
<p>『Fran, can you move on to the Divine Sword Release?』</p>
<p>But that would put too much of a burden on Isario.</p>
<p>「...I’ll do it!」</p>
<p>『Is that all!?』</p>
<p>I wanted to stall the new giant-type that Fran and I discovered. It would be best if we could kill it, but it had grown just like the giant-type from Shallus. To defeat it, we would have to see if we could do our best......</p>
<p>But things progressed faster than we could handle.</p>
<p>「Ruoooooogh!」</p>
<p>「Ruuuuuuh!」</p>
<p>The giants suddenly began to roar. They began to scream at the same time, as if they were in complete sync.</p>
<p>Immediately afterward, the giant-types began to flinch. Their outlines twisted as if they were making noise, and their bodies began to crumble as if melting.</p>
<p>Isario ignited a flame to check on her, but that didn’t stop the change. His magic power must have been somewhat reduced, but that was all.</p>
<p>In less than ten seconds, the two giant types lost their substance like black mist. At first glance, they seemed to be disappearing, but it was obvious from their unabated magical power.</p>
<p>The black mist began to flow as if it had a will of its own. It seemed that the black mist was attracted to each other. Two of the black mists then combined and formed a lump, swirling around.</p>
<p>What’s going on?</p>
<p>「Fire!」</p>
<p>Many rays were emitted from Militant Nation of Hagane, which had completed its ritual magic, and several explosions occurred inside the black mist.</p>
<p>However, it didn’t seem to work. In fact, the life force and mana that I could sense had not decreased either.</p>
<p>「Tch! Burn it up!」</p>
<p>Perhaps sensing a sense of urgency, Isario began to attack in earnest. He didn’t try to pin her, but just stop and shoot.</p>
<p>Ten flame balls over ten meters in diameter rained down on the black mist, causing a huge explosion. A considerable amount of the black mist then disappeared, and the magic power of the ball was reduced.</p>
<p>But still, the swirling black mist did not stop its movement. Rather, it accelerated, like a tornado.</p>
<p>「Ruuaaaaaah...」</p>
<p>The battlefield was once again filled with the voice of a giant. I could feel a huge mass wriggling in the black mist. Apparently, a new giant-type was about to be created.</p>
<p>In all likelihood, this is a fusion-type enhancement.</p>
<p>「Uuurghhhh!」</p>
<p>『I-I’m getting bigger!』</p>
<p>「Your magic feels amazing too」</p>
<p>「Arf!」</p>
<p>Out of the rapidly thinned fog, a new giant-type appeared. It was even taller than the giant-type from Shallus. It probably had more magic power.</p>
<p>Moreover, the transformation did not end there. His body expanded at a tremendous pace, making a rattling sound.</p>
<p>It was as if a magic beast had been inhaled all at once.</p>
<p>His body, which was already huge for no apparent reason, had become even larger. His final height was about 50% taller than that of the giant-type shorz, huh? His limbs were even thicker and longer than before.</p>
<p>「Bryaaaaah!」</p>
<p>But what had grown the most was the magic power and evil energy contained in it. Compared to the giant human-type of Shallus, which was already a monster, it had jumped almost three times. I couldn’t help but wonder how much stronger Isario would have been if he hadn’t cut it down...</p>
<p>「Get out of here!」</p>
<p>This may be the first time I’ve ever heard Isario’s shouts. But that was no surprise.</p>
<p>The super giant-type gaze with its left arm raised was clearly directed at the second unit.</p>
<p>「Bughoaaaah!」</p>
<p>「Everyone! Let’s run!」</p>
<p>Hearing Isario and you’re warning, the second unit made its move. But it was already too late.</p>
<p>The super giant-type swung down its arms and fired a magic bullet. It was a huge magic and evil-looking bullet, about 20 meters in diameter.</p>
<p>And if he were to land a direct hit on them, the second unit might be annihilated.</p>
<p>Isario’s flames wouldn’t be able to reach him in time. I didn’t think I could block him from doing so, even though I had used my earth magic to create a wall.</p>
<p>I quickly tried to lower the power of the attack with magic power absorption and evil energy manipulation, but the size was only slightly reduced.</p>
<p>「......!」</p>
<p>This was seriously bad. I could feel Fran’s frustration. But all I could do was to put up more walls with earth magic, even if I knew that it was water against the scorch.</p>
<p>In front of us, the wall of earth that had touched the magic bullet disappeared as if it had evaporated.</p>
<p>At this rate――</p>
<p>But the situation that we had feared did not come true.</p>
<p>Just before we landed on the second unit, the giant magic bullet rapidly withered and disappeared.</p>
<p>「Eh?」</p>
<p>『What is it?』</p>
<p>What really happened was so brief that I didn’t know what had happened. The sudden developments had been so sudden for the past few minutes that I’m constantly surprised!</p>
<p>「Mulsani-san.」</p>
<p>As we followed Fran’s gaze, we saw that Pine Snow, which had descended from the top of the carriage, held up a jet-black sword high. It was a longsword, everything black from the blade, as if it had inhaled all the light.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt about it. That must be the Divine Sword Berserk.</p>
<p>Even though we were tens of meters away, they were so intimidating that they made us want to quickly get away from them. In fact, some adventurers and knights near us were lying on their knees or trying to escape.</p>
<p>It was not because they were afraid of the giant magic bullets. Their attention was on Berserk. They were probably confused by the sudden appearance of Berserk nearby.</p>
<p>However, the old soldiers of General Hagane’s country did not seem to be afraid of it at all and surrounded us as if to protect the young man.</p>
<p>There was no sign of him starting to run amok. It seemed that he hadn’t released his Divine Sword Release. I had heard that he would die if I used it, but by saying that he would die if I released it, I guess he wouldn’t die if he just wielded it in a normal state.</p>
<p>Even Ignis didn’t even have to release it to give Isario a bunch of abilities, including flame magic.</p>
<p>Absorption-type power, huh? No, more like offsetting it? It looked as if I had scattered my energy and erased it.</p>
<p>I didn’t know if Berserk’s ability or if Berserk’s ability was enhanced by the fact that we were able to erase that attack in almost instant. It must be a very powerful ability.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as she thrust Berserk’s tip into the ground, she slammed one knee on it and put her forehead on the hilt. It looked like a saintess praying to the Gods.</p>
<p>However, the aura she radiated was the exact opposite of fleetingness. A vicious and ferocious magical power swirled around her, as if it had appeared in a disaster-level magic beast.</p>
<p>The adventurers around us became more and more cowards.</p>
<p>The giant-type, on the other hand, roared in hatred and raised his arms again. He intended to ignore Isario and kick the soldiers out, but he must be angry at her for being interrupted. It seems to have a human smell, or rather, a sense of living intelligence and emotion.</p>
<p>I let magic power rise from her entire body and braced myself to release more magic bullets than before.</p>
<p>「Bruaaaaa――?」</p>
<p>However, his movements soon stopped, causing a confused moan. When I paid closer attention, I could see that his right leg, which looked like a giant tower, was gradually turning black.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, Berserk had released several kinds of magic power onto his giant legs.</p>
<p>「Bughugaa......!」</p>
<p>「He’s dead.」</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but think that the mutterings of the two were strangely loud on a battlefield where only the roars of giants echoed.</p>
<p>That’s when the giant-type legs began to wilt at a tremendous pace.</p>
<p>The figure of her right leg, which had turned dark and weakened as thin and weak as a withered plant, was exactly what I expected.</p>
<p>The giant-type tried to swing its arms around to support its body, but could not fully support its huge body, which had lost its balance rapidly.</p>
<p>Finally, his right leg snapped with a bogging sound, and the giant-type fell to his back. And strangely enough, his broken right leg did not regenerate.</p>
<p>As if only her right leg had died, as if she had been muttering something like that.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the battle, we’ve been using regeneration-inhibiting life magic. It didn’t seem to work on the giant-type, but...</p>
<p>This must be a Divine Sword. It had overwhelming power even without being liberated.</p>
<p>But the backlash from using it was also great.</p>
<p>「......!」</p>
<p>As soon as she tried to get up, the snowy tree started to sway and fell to one knee again. His face was pale, and I could tell that her exhaustion was extraordinary.</p>
