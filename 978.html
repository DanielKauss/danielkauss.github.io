</div><h1>Chapter 978</h1><p>We didn’t get the amount of food we wanted as a result of our search for Barhar. The only thing we found was a magic circle that emitted evil energy. This time, Isario and the others also called over to us to confirm it. Well, we were not experts, so we didn’t know the specifics. In the end, we removed the evil crystals and killed the Ibiru berserker instantly. Isario and the others were discussing their plans for their next move. </p>
<p>「It would be safe to say that all the giant types that we had originally planned have been exterminated. What should we do now?」</p>
<p> But what should we do now?」</p>
<p>「Yes, you’re right. There were no rescue requests from the other groups, right?」</p>
<p>「Yes. Well, the towns around here are almost completely destroyed, so you may not be able to get in touch with them.」</p>
<p>「Even so, I’m sure I’ll send you some quick horses. As long as you don’t have any instructions, you won’t be able to complain if you move around as you please」</p>
<p>「Okay――」</p>
<p>「Now that you mention it...」</p>
<p>  As we were talking about this, we noticed a group approaching us. Since they were a mixture of adventurers, knights, and soldiers, it seemed that they were rescue teams formed in each city just like us. They must have been sent from a different city than us. The commanders of that unit contacted us as well.  They also came to see how Bahar was. They said that the residents of Barhar had escaped slightly and asked for help in the neighborhood.  After discussing the situation with them, Isario and the others decided to hand over the refugees to them here. Our troops had overwhelmingly prevailed in terms of combat power, and we judged that it would be in the best interest of the continent if the second troops were freed.  The second unit was now freed, but there were some new contacts with them. No, rather than the troops, it was more correct to say that they had contacted Fran. It was just right after they handed over the guards of the Sante residents to the rescue team.  We sensed the presence of something approaching us again, and it was moving at a tremendous speed.  Was it a messenger or something?  No, it wasn’t a messenger.  It was clearly clad in evil, but it was not a presence of antidemons.  An evil person――or was it, a dragonkin.  It was a dragonkin that emitted evil energy. However, we remained vigilant and waited for the evil dragonkin to appear. That showed that we knew the culprit.  The evil energy radiating from the dragonkin was overwhelmingly stronger, but it was definitely Frederick. He didn’t seem to be running, but he would use his wings to approach us as if he was gliding through the earth.  Frederick from that timeline didn’t have any wings, right?  It was actually growing in Velmeria, but......  </p>
<p>「Frederick」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>  Even though Fran knew they were acquaintances, Isario and the kid remained vigilant. They knew that some of the dragonkin were acting as black as possible, and that they were evil spirits.  So dense that it couldn’t be helped. They were radiating such a dense evil spirit that they felt as if they were giving them power as a sacrifice to the Evil God.  They must have known that they were emitting a suspicious presence. Frederick fended off his blade once, then suddenly braking and stopping in front of the second unit.  He raised his hands towards us to show that he had no hostility towards us. Still, Isario and Frederick remained vigilant because of Frederick’s expression.  Frederick’s face was clearly not calm.  Whether it was anger, impatience, or a different kind of emotion. His eyebrows were frowned upon and he was suppressing his emotions to the point that it was obvious at first glance.  However, he remained calm. Frederick slowly opened his mouth to avoid seeming hostile.  </p>
<p>「... He looks like this, but I don’t think he has any harmful intentions. However, there was an emergency situation with the Black Lightning Princess-dono there, and I was able to make contact with him in this manner while disrespecting him.」</p>
<p>  Isario was the one who called out to Frederick. I guess he was appealing that he was not an enemy to someone who could kill him instantly.  </p>
<p>「... Well, I guess that’s not the case...」</p>
<p>「Nn.  Frederick is fine. What’s wrong?  Velmeria?」</p>
<p>「Black Lightning Princess......  I’m begging you!  Save Velmeria!」</p>
<p>  Frederick was suddenly on his knees while Fran was tilting her head at the fact that Velmeria was nowhere to be seen. I thought he was calm, but he seemed to be being cornered.  </p>
<p>「What do you mean?」</p>
<p>「Velmeria has been captured by the Dragon King......」</p>
<p> Frederick recounted the past few days. </p>
<p>「We were looking for the Dragon King’s location to rescue Velmeria’s mother......」</p>
<p>「Mom, were you captured by the Dragon King?」</p>
<p>「Yes, that’s right......」</p>
<p> Velmeria’s mother, Tilanaria, was apparently in the southern dragonkin’s settlement.  However, there were dragonkin attacks in the northern settlements, and they had taken her away. At that time, they said something about their connection to the Dragon King.  They managed to get information about Tilanaria by crushing the executives of the Dragon King Syndicate and the black market slavers.Velmeria and Frederick were convinced that their mother had been taken to the center of the continent and moved to rescue her.  However, the unusually strong dragonkin interrupted them and captured Velmeria. At the same time, they also attacked the antidemons.  In order to escape from the danger, Frederick seemed to have used the abilities of a half-evil dragonkin to purposely absorb evil energy and increase his power.In order to escape from that danger, Frederick seemed to have used the abilities of a half-evil dragonkin to absorb evil energy and increase his power.  He seemed to be close to the limit of what he could do with his evil energy.  The only reason Frederick’s mood was one of anger and impatience, but it was probably because his evil energy made him easily angry.  </p>
<p>「I managed to escape, but......  Velmeria was taken away!」</p>
<p>「The dragonkin was that strong?」</p>
<p>「Yeah.  They were always on par with high-ranking warriors. Besides......」</p>
<p>「Besides?」</p>
<p>「Umm, antidemons......」</p>
<p>  Frederick cut to his words.  Apparently, he wasn’t confident in what he said. However, he quickly narrowed it down to what he felt.  </p>
<p>「Those antidemons...... It was as if those dragonkin were manipulating antidemons......」</p>
<p>  Fran and I didn’t laugh at each other with stupid questions. After seeing the antidemons that appeared so conveniently for the Dragon King, we could feel them too.Frederick’s words further strengthened Fran’s assurance.</p>
