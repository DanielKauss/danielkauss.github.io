</div><h1>Chapter 1044</h1><p>「Well, it can’t be helped. We’re in a hurry to lose the Divine Sword Knight after all」</p>
<p>「!」</p>
<p> After Fran was surprised to hear Mea’s words, Sophie and Yagilale then opened their mouths with an involuntary look. </p>
<p>「I heard you’ve lost the Divine Sword Knight... Eh? He’s dead?」</p>
<p>「Is that really true?」</p>
<p> Adoll was dead? But we have not confirmed her to be okay... </p>
<p>「I’m not saying she’s dead」</p>
<p>「Yeah, it’s misleading」</p>
<p>「Yeah, it’s misleading」</p>
<p>  It was the truth!  </p>
<p>「So, you lost it?」</p>
<p>「You can’t seem to see it.  Apparently, she escaped. It’s what Quina had been investigating.  There’s no doubt about it」</p>
<p>「What happened to her Divine Sword?」</p>
<p>「She didn’t take it with her.  If I steal her Divine Sword, she’ll be chased to the very end of the earth. She looked obedient, but I’m sure she had a lot of it in her mind.」</p>
<p>「Yeah. Adoru is...」</p>
<p> Fran muttered with a complicated expression. Adoru may not like Fran because she didn’t like her, but she was also a comrade in arms.  I may have been involved in the story of selling Sophie, but I don’t think she would be involved in such a conspiracy. Rather than not doing it because of her personality, I think she couldn’t afford to interfere with the country in any way. It would be more understandable if he thought that Silard’s intelligence and dark circles were using the names of the divine sword knights to plot against each other in various places.It was more understandable that he was not the one in charge of the antidemon ring, but the intelligence and dark circles in Silard were using the names of the divine sword knights to try and plot against each other in various places.  </p>
<p>「So you’re telling me that Silard was trying to take me by force......」</p>
<p>「I guess he’s just gonna have to go to his country to make a move.  I don’t even know what kind of punishment he’ll get for letting the divine sword knights escape.  Therefore, I want to bring back the strong and score some points.」</p>
<p> If we return to our country, there would be a replacement for the divine sword knights.  But apparently, he didn’t bring them with him now. That’s probably why he called out to Fran and Sophie. Especially in Sophie’s case, she was sure that she was a Divine Sword user.  The recruitment process must have been quite violent. </p>
<p>「It would be better to die on this continent if you go to that country!」</p>
<p>「Then how about our country?」</p>
<p>「Eh?」</p>
<p>  Sophie’s point was in response to Yagilale’s words. She probably didn’t expect him to be recruited with a sense of disgust for the recruitment.  Moreover, she even took Mea’s word for it.  </p>
<p>「We’d love to join our country too!  If you’re a Divine Sword Magic-User, we’re all welcome! </p>
<p>「Ah!  You’re so slouch, Nemea-sama! Our country should do the same!」</p>
<p>「Umm?」</p>
<p>「Don’t worry, I’m not going to tie you up with a bad contract. Well, as a servant of the country, I need to recruit some wild divine sword users.」</p>
<p>「Me too. Besides, I’m confident that it’s a better option than Silard.」</p>
<p>「Indeed!  It’s better than Silard!」</p>
<p>  The main idea is that they’ll join in if they don’t have any other choice. I wanted to tell them to consult with Silard rather than thinking about the people of Nocta.  </p>
<p>「But Sophie was originally a nobleman of some country, wasn’t she?  I’ve heard that your foster father was a musician and a noble? But can’t we ignore her?」</p>
<p>「That’s......」</p>
<p>  Apparently, Mea had heard about Sophie’s situation halfway through. She casually talked to Sophie’s foster father.  However, when she saw Sophie’s expression, she immediately understood that something was wrong.  </p>
<p>「Umm, what the hell was wrong with my hearing?  Yeah! Maybe it was someone else’s.」</p>
<p> Sophie spoke with a stern read.  However, Sophie immediately shook her head and began to explain her situation, as if she had overcome the trauma of the past.  </p>
<p>「I see.  I can’t just keep ignoring my foster father――」</p>
<p>  Her story was almost the same as before. Her love, hatred, and swirling past stories were intertwined with her complicated feelings for her foster father.  It was as hard as ever as ever in her childhood. Fran was the one to be confused about, but Sophie was also quite a strange person in her life.  Mea had also lost her word.  However, Yagilale seemed to be the one who had been thinking about something. </p>
<p>「Did your foster father’s name not be Rober Sarras-dono?」</p>
<p>「You know him?」</p>
<p>「Yes.  He was famous on the continent of Kaple」</p>
<p> The Kingdom of Segilusel was apparently located in the northern part of Kaple. It was on the opposite continent of Gordicia from the continent of Jilbard, where the Kingdom of Kranzel was located. Sophie was also from the continent of Kapur.  </p>
<p>「As the leader of the knights, I’ve heard a lot about that incident. However, things were very different from what I had heard, so I’m confused」</p>
<p>「What do you mean?」</p>
<p>「The incident involving Viscount Sarrath was ostensibly clashing with the bandit.」</p>
<p>「Partnership?」</p>
<p>「Yes.」</p>
<p> From Sophie’s point of view, her foster father had led a mercenary group to attack the village where she was from and killed her family.  However, Yagilale told us that Viscount Sarrath was led by a group of serious criminal slaves, and the opponent he fought was a bandit group that occupied the village. And then, after a fierce and fierce clash, the Viscount returned to his former home.  </p>
<p>「That has been reported to our country」</p>
<p>「No... That is...」</p>
<p>  Sophie stared at Yagilale with a confused look. She must have doubts that the tragedy she had believed in the past would be denied and she would not react in any way.  </p>
<p>「We have an allied relationship with his country, and our people are also going in and investigating the area.  So, I’m sure of it」</p>
<p>「So what is the village I was born in?  Mom, Dad, and sister?  Was I a kid of a bandit?  Or was all this a lie? </p>
<p>「Apparently.  So it sounded like they were all confused, but Sarrath-dono was indeed a musical crazed man, but he didn’t seem to have any ill intentions. Sophie wanted to give her a taste of all that emotion.」</p>
<p>「B-But then, I killed my foster father――」</p>
<p> Sophie muttered something for a while with a careless expression on her face. </p>
<p>「Sophie, are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Fran...」</p>
<p>「Sophie, I see.  Wasn’t your foster father satisfied?」</p>
<p>「What do you mean......?」</p>
<p>「He died in a state where he was not risking his life, listening to the ultimate music.  I guess he really wants to hear it.」</p>
<p>「No! No way......」</p>
<p>  Sophie’s words lost power in an attempt to argue with Mea.  She must have convinced her earlier that that might be the case. Judging by the personality of Viscount Sarrath, she really does look like that. </p>
<p>「First of all, we have to find out how true that is.」</p>
<p>「I’ll help you too.」</p>
<p>「Thank you」</p>
<p>「But, you’re glad」</p>
<p>「Eh?」</p>
<p>「Because Mom and Dad may be alive」</p>
<p>「Tsk!  Oh!Fran lost her parents, so the weight was completely different.Fran lost her parents, so the weight was completely different. Sophie nodded with a complicated look on her face after she rolled her eyes in surprise.</p>
