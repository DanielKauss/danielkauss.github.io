</div><h1>Chapter 923</h1><p>After the surrounding antidemons were destroyed by the steel wolves, Fran’s deflection was perfect.</p>
<p>But this was not the time to miss this chance.</p>
<p>「Keep going! Defeat the antidemon boss!」</p>
<p>『Yeah! But don’t let your guard down!』</p>
<p>「Don’t worry!」</p>
<p>Fran shouted and increased her speed even more. Then, she ran toward the direction where she was going to release a stronger presence.</p>
<p>「Taaaaah!」</p>
<p>Fran and I fired thunder to defeat the antidemons in our path, and before the antidemons could fill the empty space, Fran rushed in and swung me again.</p>
<p>While cutting down the antidemons in the way, Fran immediately rushed towards the antidemon commander. She broke through the tens of thousands of antidemons’ barriers in just a few seconds.</p>
<p>Divine Beast Form was terrifying. But it would not be an exaggeration to say that this was a true battle.</p>
<p>「Woooof!」</p>
<p>「Ghugyogh!」</p>
<p>「Shaaaaa!」</p>
<p>「Hmm. There’s someone strong in there!」</p>
<p>『But not against that number......!』</p>
<p>Obviously, there was a special antidemon that had a different atmosphere, power, and appearance than the other antidemons. But there was not just one, but five of them were waiting for Fran.</p>
<p>Who is the commander of this swarm? Or is they all? Or does they have something stronger? But these guys are clearly special.</p>
<p>Twisted Horn was the strongest antidemon we had fought so far. I didn’t think it was that strong, but it was much stronger than the red dragon-type antidemons, which were stronger than the red dragon-type ones.</p>
<p>「...Just crush them all」</p>
<p>Fran muttered to herself and glared at the antidemons, who appeared to be the commanders with belligerent eyes.</p>
<p>『All right! We can do it now! As long as we give it our all!』</p>
<p>「I don’t know how long I’ll be able to become a Divine Beast. I’ll do my best to get closer to you!」</p>
<p>『Yeah! I’ll split it up with the help of my steel wolves. Let’s finish each one of them one by one!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>This wasn’t an easy fight by any stretch of the imagination, but we should be able to fight one-on-one. But before we could challenge the battle, we saw a new intruder appearing in this place.</p>
<p>「I’m going to fight too!」</p>
<p>「I’ll do it too!」</p>
<p>「Grrrrr!」</p>
<p>「Hahaha! Mix in me!」</p>
<p>Velmeria’s whole body except for her face was transformed into a dragon, Zefmate with a leopard face giving off blue magic, Urushi in black darkness, Mea with white flames, and a group of friends.</p>
<p>Their level of enhancement was comparable to Fran’s. Velmeria, with her light blue scales all over her body, was in a Divine Dragon Form, probably regaining the power she had when she went on a rampage in the Royal Capital.</p>
<p>Zefmate’s head had completely transformed into a leopard. In addition, the shape of his legs was as close as possible to that of a beast, and his body was covered with the Divine Attribute. It was clearly not in a normal state of awakening.</p>
<p>My appraisal told me that he would become a Holy Beast. Maybe this was the final destination of all the Beastmen other than the Ten Primordial Beastmen.</p>
<p>My agility was over 1,500, which was what I called the “Blue Leap” skill. It was a skill named after a race. There was no way it was weak. It seemed to be able to clothe my entire body with the power of a leopard’s leg.</p>
<p>I guess that means he’s honing his tricky movements and offensive abilities.</p>
<p>Urushi was in a Potential Release state. Potential Release was dangerous, but now, thanks to Sophie’s song, he was in an auto-recovery state. Apparently, the burden was much lighter than the Potential Release we used.</p>
<p>There seemed to be almost no auto-destruction. This would prolong our self-destruction.</p>
<p>Her stats, except for her agility, have not increased much.</p>
<p>However, she had an Innate Skill called “Twisty”. It seemed to be a forced debuffing ability that greatly weakened the opponent she touched.</p>
<p>Mea was probably the one who made the most terrifying evolution. She was in her White Beast state, but her stats had exceeded 1,000 across the board, and “Divine Flame” had been added to her list of skills.</p>
<p>The white flames all over her body were emitting Divine Attributes, and the auto counter was not enough to be described as evil.</p>
<p>With just a single touch of it, the white divine flames spread over her entire body. And she never disappeared until she was gone.</p>
<p>「Mea amazing」</p>
<p>「Fuahaha! I see! But this is not the only power I have gotten!」</p>
<p>With a loud laugh, Mea pulled out the sword on her back.</p>
<p>Just like that, she held up her beloved sword high.</p>
<p>That was the Divine Sword inhabited by the Red Dragon Lind.</p>
<p>「Could it be!?」</p>
<p>「That’s right! Now that both I and Lind have been strengthened, a new gate to power has been opened!」</p>
<p>Mea swung her Divine Sword horizontally and shouted.</p>
<p>「O dragon king, the dragon of red violence! Appear before me!」</p>
<p>Right now, a second Divine Sword was about to materialize.</p>
<p>「Lindvlm, Divine Sword Release!」</p>
<p>The violent dragon sword, Lindwurm, responded to Mea’s shout. An enormous amount of magic power began to swirl around the divine sword.</p>
<p>The engraving of the red dragon on its blade gave off a fierce light. Then, the light enveloped the entire sword and emitted a powerful flash of light.</p>
<p>「Gugyah!」</p>
<p>Mea herself, who was the closest to us, was the one who’s been keeping her eyes on me!</p>
<p>「My eyes! My eyes!」</p>
<p>『Musu~h!』</p>
<p>「Mrgh?」</p>
<p>『Sorry, it’s nothing. I felt like I had to go a little deeper into it』</p>
<p>But still, something like a suicide bomb after my first Divine Sword Release! Don’t tighten it up!</p>
