</div><h1>Chapter 1137</h1><p>(Hmm?)</p>
<p>『It’s coming from a fort!』</p>
<p>The leader of the Crimson Flame Knights could never remain silent after all.</p>
<p>A vermilion mana was erupting from the roof of the fort. This mana had a strong fire attribute, so much so that I could feel the heat even from here.</p>
<p>A young man stood in the middle of the vermilion mana. He looked like a cheeky-looking young man, just like Ionez, the vice-commander. Bros.? Twins? Anyway, there was no doubt that he had a blood connection.</p>
<p>『Fran, warn everyone!』</p>
<p>(Got it!)</p>
<p>Their opponent was the leader of the Red Knight Order, which was said to be the strongest in the world. I had no idea what kind of attack they would launch. I braced myself while kneading my magic so that I could deploy a barrier at any time.</p>
<p>Immediately afterward, the magic on the rooftop exploded.</p>
<p>The magic power that had grown so fast that it became the pillar of vermilion flames. As I thought it could bounce one after another, several prominence-like arms of flame ascended to the sky, and intertwined to create huge fire balls.</p>
<p>It must have already grown to about the size of a fort.</p>
<p>That’s not good.</p>
<p>Moreover, yet another undead appeared on the battlefield. They started to rise one after another as the corpse on the battlefield looked enveloped in magic power.</p>
<p>『We have no choice but to ignore the undead and let them all go!』</p>
<p>Maybe he’d just ignore the undead and start attacking them instead. The Black Skeleton Army and the Red Knight Order seemed to be on bad terms with each other, and they treated us as a force for easy replenishment.</p>
<p>「Donad! This place is dangerous!」</p>
<p>「Guys! That’s getting lower! Leave the undead behind!」</p>
<p>「Guys! Run!」</p>
<p>「Yes! Captain!」</p>
<p>「Avenger is over here!」</p>
<p>「O priestess! Please call us not to die!」</p>
<p>「Those who will not die! You will be with me!」</p>
<p>「Fuahaha! Okay! My priestess!」</p>
<p>I would really like Fran to run away with me, but there is no way Fran would abandon the adventurers. Thanks to this mission, Fran has learned a sense of responsibility. She must have also become aware that she was a senior adventurer.</p>
<p>That’s a good thing, but at times like this, I’ve jumped into danger myself. I have mixed feelings about it.</p>
<p>『If it comes to it, I’ll just teleport and get out of here, okay?』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>The adventurers began to move immediately, but the movements of the nobles’ legion were very slow. This had blocked their retreats.</p>
<p>「What are you doing over there!?」</p>
<p>「What are you saying!? We’re this far away!」</p>
<p>「Impossible! You can’t see that!」</p>
<p>「What are you afraid of at this distance! You’re a timid! Are you not ashamed as a person from the Kingdom of Kranzel!?」</p>
<p>Tch! The nobles are way too stupid!</p>
<p>Apparently, he had too little combat experience, so he thought that attacking from the fort would not be possible even at this distance. Well, not that it was impossible for the strong.</p>
<p>Besides, the nobles and their subordinates have not been able to play an active role so much in this situation. Moreover, they were looking down on the adventurers here. That must have made them even more determined.</p>
<p>The knight commander joined in his persuasion, but the nobles looked dissatisfied. They even smirked at a scene where they were fighting for a second!</p>
<p>Donadrond must have realized that there was no point in arguing with them. He then looked away from the nobles and gave the adventurers more instructions again.</p>
<p>「Ignore the idiots and go around them! You don’t have to go around destroying them yourself!」</p>
<p>「I-Impossible! You!」</p>
<p>The nobles were angry, but Donadrond completely ignored them. The knight captain also showed signs of continuing Donadrond. He decided to abandon the nobles.</p>
<p>Well, disobeying the knight captain’s order on the battlefield was disobeying orders after all.</p>
<p>Some of the nobles, seeing what the Knight Commander did, must have understood that it was really dangerous. Some of them changed their attitudes and began to leave. The nobles who recognized Fran had moved on to escape from the beginning.</p>
<p>In that case, the undead would be in better shape with less strength, so the nobles would have no choice but to retreat......</p>
<p>It was a little too late.</p>
<p>『Fran! I’ll put up a barrier!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>I saw a huge fire ball launched towards us, created above the fort.</p>
<p>Fran and I put up barriers using flame magic as much as we could to protect the adventurers. However, there were other adventurers who tried to protect us.</p>
<p>I could see two light green barriers overlapping the flame magic barrier we had created. And it was quite a wide area.</p>
<p>They must have put up such a barrier. I knew they were good at support, but I never thought they would be able to put up such a barrier...</p>
<p>That’s Rank A, and I’m sure Persona also has the power befitting her partner.</p>
<p>Then, the super fire sphere, which was nearly 30 meters in diameter, landed. The direct hit was not the adventurer who had already begun to leave the battlefield, but the noble army that had remained. I guess they have little control over its trajectory.</p>
<p>I had prepared for a huge explosion, but the blast that I was afraid of did not hit us.</p>
<p>Our barriers only covered the adventurers and their vicinity. The only thing we could do was to watch the soldiers and nobles burned at a distance.</p>
<p>Then fire overflowed and swallowed the surroundings. The tsunami of death that ignited my body at the mere touch of it, continued to cause damage to a wide area.</p>
<p>Nearly thousands of soldiers turned into live torches, and overflowing flames rushed at the adventurers all at once. But we, Mapicent, and the other magicians had put up a barrier that managed to hold them back.</p>
<p>It managed to hold on, even though my mana was being whittled down.</p>
<p>『Guh!』</p>
<p>「Muh!」</p>
<p>It was a considerable burden, combined with physical pressure. But there was reassuring support. The white light enveloped us and the magic power began to recover.</p>
<p>「Nrgh!」</p>
<p>Donadrond activated the light again. It was the unique skill of the guardian demon, the 『 shine of the guardian』. I’m really grateful for the slight auto-recovery now.</p>
<p>『Just a little more! Persevere, Fran!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
