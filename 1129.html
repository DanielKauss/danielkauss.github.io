</div><h1>Chapter 1129</h1><p>This is not a good idea. We will lose in this battle if we don’t do something. The undead emerged from behind us, the red knights deployed from the fort, and the surprise attack unit appeared out of nowhere and attacked our right-wing as if to mock our sniper brigade. The left-wing side that opened was probably also a trap. It was trying to guide us over there. As I searched by sending my sword flying, I noticed that a huge amount of magic power was emanating from under the earth. As I searched by sending my sword flying, I noticed that a huge amount of magic power was emanating from under the ground.  We should turn back to cover us, but the scout was also under attack. This one was also an undead.  It seemed that there were quite a few high-ranking necromancers in the enemy army.  The undead were quite strong. I had greatly reduced the number of them with my abilities before we became enemies, but in a disorderly battle, I couldn’t shoot swords over a wide area.  For a later reason, it was not the time to save our strength. This time, we had to use one of our trump cards.  </p>
<p>「Jig, this is my trump card」</p>
<p>「Forrund’s husband...!  I’m on it!」</p>
<p>「Yeah」</p>
<p>「You little one! Take your husband’s sword!」</p>
<p>  I told Jig, a Rank C adventurer who acted like my second-in-command, to cut her trump card. It was very useful because it told me how to move on its own.  Jig quickly told the adventurers about their plans and I activated the Sword God’s Favor with all my might.  A variety of swords appeared in front of the adventurers assigned to the scout. This was one of my secret techniques, the long-term embodiment of the sword.  Normally, I use it to reveal the sword for a few seconds only, except for the sword I wield, and to shoot it out and erase it immediately. There was no point in leaving it for a long time, but wearing it out was extraordinary.  However, that was not impossible.  By making countless swords tangible as it was now and making use of them with their comrades, we could strengthen our forces at once. By doing so, I was able to increase the fighting power of the entire unit and increase the survival rate of everyone.  Those who took my sword were enveloped in magic.  It was created around a sword that increased status and had a healing effect.  Even those who couldn’t use the sword were more effective at equipping it.  But instead, it would take a lot of my magic power for it.  After this battle, my fighting power would be greatly reduced for a while. But that only comes to survival.  </p>
<p>「Let’s go!」</p>
<p>「Huh!  Bastards!  I’ll bring you on!」</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Wooooooooooooooooo!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>  With the adventurers clad in colorful mana, I leapt into the undead’s army. I wielded my cleansing swords in my hands and slashed the spirits aside.  Quite a bit of time had passed when we defeated the undead’s army, especially the knights that we had defeated.  The damage was also considerable. The knights that had been marching along the path in particular probably killed nearly a hundred people.  But it was too dangerous to divide their forces here. They would have to go to the rescue of their main forces while protecting the wounded.  Was this their goal?  Either way, they were too late. We should meet up with the main forces and leave the battlefield together.  As we went further in, we bumped into the knights in red armor. The Knights were the guardians of the Kingdom of Raydoss, but I didn’t expect them to be this strong.  The adventurers who were equipped with my sword were ahead. Moreover, the young man in charge of the knight was ridiculously strong.  </p>
<p>「Ha-ha-ha-ha!  Burn!  Those shitty knights of Kranzel!」</p>
<p>  He was about twenty years old.  The young magician-like man, who had carefully patted his blue hair, fortunately brushed away our moves to get a hit.  His magic was immense, and his melee combat skills were quite impressive. He also seemed to have a special skill that strengthened the red knights.  The red knights’ armor was enveloped in flames, which increased their attack and defense.The red knights’ armor was engulfed in flames, and their attack power and defense increased.  Moreover, it also seemed to have the effect of blocking fire, and even if they were caught in flame magic, the knights remained calm.  As a result, flame magic was shot over a wide area, causing damage only to us.  And that was the vicious cycle of the red knights breaking through the chaos in their formation. If I didn’t get rid of that young man, this flow wouldn’t stop.  I slashed at him to interrupt his chanting.  However, a flame barrier that suddenly flared up blocked him. </p>
<p>「To think you didn’t notice until we were this close, are you a high-ranking adventurer?」</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>「Doesn’t mean you’re going to give me any information?  Hmm, do you mean there’s some good guy in there though?」</p>
<p>  My bad words are useful at times like this. I held up my sword against an opponent that I admired on my own.  </p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>「Then just die without saying anything!」</p>
<p>  He looked down on us, but he didn’t force us to slash at him. Despite her arrogant tone, she seemed to have a clear idea that she was at a disadvantage in melee combat.  At the same time, she activated a series of flame magic spells.  No chanting, and with multiple activations. I quickly created a magic sword with flame resistance and wiped it out.  </p>
<p>「Huh?  What the hell is that!?  You’re just kidding my weakling habit! Get out of the flames!」</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>「Tch!  How silent are you!?」</p>
<p>  He was a very skilled magician.  He unleashed top-level magic without pause.  The flame resistance of his magic sword was not completely nullified. It would be dangerous to get hit by that level of magic in succession.  He was in a stalemate.  No, he still had some room for leeway, but I was already close to the limit. I had lent my 100 magic swords to my friends, and they were continuing to consume my magic power.  If I deactivated my physical form for a while, there was a possibility that I could defeat the young man with a saturating attack on his sword.  However, my friends would be destroyed by the red knights instead. So, I had no choice but to keep maintaining it.  </p>
<p>「Here you go, here I come!  counterattack!」</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>「Barely bastard!」</p>
<p>  I’ll ride on that provoke.  I suddenly saw me leaning forward with my black sword sticking out.  I guess he didn’t expect me to ride on the provoke to irritate us. Moreover, he ignored his boasting flame magic and became fleshy.  I quickly tried to defend with the flame sword in my hand, but my black sword extinguished the flame sword.  This magic sword was a hungry magic sword. It is a magic sword that eats everything and disappears.  Instead, it devours my magic, physical, and life force at the same time. I’m often ridiculed for being reckless, but it was one of the forbidden hands that I couldn’t use.  However, even if I used it, it did not reach the young man. What a turn of events!  He turned himself into flames and instantly moved away from me as if he was teleporting.  It may not be a technique that can be repeated because he had considerably reduced his magic power, but I don’t think he can catch it even if he’s forced to follow.  Do I have to cut off the trump card? It would be my life expectancy to lose my friends here――.  </p>
<p>「Hmm?」</p>
<p>「What? What the hell is that!?」</p>
<p>  Just like the young man, I was surprised.  It wasn’t just me.  All the adventurers were enveloped in a white light.  I could tell that it was not a bad thing by looking at it.  It was clearly hiding the power of its defense. In fact, the wounds we inflicted were gradually healing.  What in the world just happened? Just as the white light and confusion spread at the same time on the battlefield, black lightning poured down on the battlefield this time.  </p>
<p>「Forrund! Are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Yes」</p>
<p>  The adventurers cheered at the sight of a black cat girl atop a giant wolf. But I felt as confused as joy.  </p>
<p>「Our priestesses!  Leave the undead to me!」</p>
<p>「Nn.  Please.」</p>
<p> Ghouls clad in evil spirits appeared as if to follow Fran.What in the world just happened? Just as the white light and confusion spread at the same time on the battlefield, black lightning rained down on the battlefield. </p>
