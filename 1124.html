</div><h1>Chapter 1124</h1><p>We’ve been training at Fran’s Bootcamp for the past three days.</p>
<p>The valiant soldiers had been surprisingly transformed into serious people. They had crisp movements, worked well together with their friends, and at the end of the day, they had curry and talked about the wonders of work.</p>
<p>She had already returned the carriage, and her escort was in a perfect state. Originally, there was no problem with her abilities. Once her personality had improved, there was no need to worry.</p>
<p>That doesn’t sound like a bit of a brainwashing technique, but it’s better than being captured by a magic beast.</p>
<p>Actually, at the end of the second day, Mareficent had revealed the truth to us.</p>
<p>The only thing that started to happen was that Fran had noticed the presence of the spirit.</p>
<p>At night, Fran suddenly looked around. There was no sign of any magic beast around, and her eyes were neither on the valiant soldiers nor the Marquis Saints.</p>
<p>For some reason, I felt like I was wandering around in an empty sky.</p>
<p>『What’s wrong?』</p>
<p>(It’s the spirit)</p>
<p>『What?』</p>
<p>(There’s many of them.)</p>
<p>Several spirits seemed to be floating around. I couldn’t feel any sign of them, but I thought of a way to find them.</p>
<p>I activated Spirit’s Hand and tried to spread it around me along with my telekinesis. As I felt it, something was slightly touching me.</p>
<p>They escaped in surprise the moment they touched it, but they couldn’t see it and couldn’t feel it, so they must be a spirit.</p>
<p>Maybe there are at least five or six of them?</p>
<p>(I know this presence.)</p>
<p>『What?』</p>
<p>(Klimt’s Spirit of Water and the Spirit of Wind)</p>
<p>It seems that before she knew it, Fran was able to sense the difference between spirits.</p>
<p>By Klimut’s spirit, I mean that he was secretly guarding us? Or was he watching over us?</p>
<p>『This request may not be just simple transportation of supplies after all』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p>Come to think of it, the quality of the valiant soldiers was too poor. Even though they were capable, the valiant soldiers at the time they joined up were too nasty. Just as Fran had thought, they were all guaranteed to be a hindrance to their allies in the front line.</p>
<p>Moreover, our guide was Rank A. I couldn’t help but feel a little strange.</p>
<p>As I was wondering about what to do while staring at the spirit, I saw Mareficent’s party approaching us.</p>
<p>「You realized that feeling, huh?」</p>
<p>「...There’s a lot of spirits in there」</p>
<p>「Did you have the talent to see spirits!? Maybe, Klimt-san knows that, right? You know it, don’t you?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Klimt-san is already being kinda soft on children!」</p>
<p>「Something’s wrong with this request? It’s strange that you’re coming with us for a request like this」</p>
<p>「That’s how far you sensed it」</p>
<p>Mareficent raised his hands and lamented, with a wry smile on his mouth.</p>
<p>「Hah. What do you think, Persona?」</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>Persona thrust her fist out of her mouth and thumbed up at Mareficent’s words.</p>
<p>「You say that, don’t you? We won’t know how they’ll turn if we continue to be wary of us, and it can’t be helped. Worst case scenario, they’d even tell us about it」</p>
<p>「Didn’t Mareficent really have some special mission?」</p>
<p>「Yes」</p>
<p>Fran sat back down as Mareficent urged her to sit down. I guess it was a bit too long.</p>
<p>「The first thing that triggered my reaction was that the government had requested you to rank up」</p>
<p>「From a country? The Kingdom of Kranzel?」</p>
<p>「Yes. If you become an A-ranked adventurer, it will be easier for you to accept requests from countries, and above all, the creation of new strong people has an influence that cannot be ignored in war. Did you manage a request related to a country?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「That’s why the country decided that it was worthy of Rank A. Well, the guild was to decide it, but the guilds in various places seemed to support us one after another」</p>
<p>「Is that so?」</p>
<p>It wasn’t good before, right?</p>
<p>However, the situation seemed to have changed. They had originally been offered a rank-up recommendation. And that was also a great achievement in the war this time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the branches of Gordicia and Belioth reported that they were a little behind, so the direction of the wind suddenly changed.</p>
<p>「I heard that I might be able to promoted Black Lightning Princess-dono if she was doing this well. So, I decided to conduct a rank-up test as soon as possible」</p>
<p>The rank-up exam for Rank A adventurers was supposed to assign a mission that was a little more difficult and see how well they could overcome it.</p>
<p>「It’s Klimt-san who took the most bite out of it this time, I guess」</p>
<p>Klimut was originally preparing a normal transport unit for this mission. 200 ordinary brave soldiers and 20 carriages.</p>
<p>But then someone at the top of the Adventurer’s Guild interrupted us. The guild just thought it was a good place for the rank-up exam.</p>
<p>The details have been changed and the mission of special transportation that was supposed to be in charge of by Marellisent will be used for Fran’s test.</p>
<p>Klimt said that he was still early to rank up, so resisted that the higher echelons of the guild were in trouble. However, he was unable to overturn the decision of the guild headquarters.</p>
<p>From Klimt’s point of view, Fran trusted him to reveal about me, but right after that, he would do the rank-up test like a trick to defeat me. As a serious man, he must have been unable to accept it obediently. Moreover, he was willing to use Fran, a child in the war.</p>
<p>I’ll tell her when we get back that I don’t mind.</p>
<p>Then, Mareficent was placed as a guide and an examiner, accompanying her on the mission. In addition, Mareficent was also said to be in the middle of performing her original special transportation mission.</p>
<p>「What is that mission?」</p>
<p>「It’s similar to what Black Lightning Princess-dono is doing now. Those who have decided that it would be problematic to determine the sex roots of the bad volunteer soldiers and use them as they are, I and Persona will be separated and re-educated」</p>
<p>In other words, she was doing both Fran’s rank-up test and the bad behavior adventurer’s test at the same time.</p>
<p>「Spirit was something that Klimt-san had insisted on. It was too tough for a solo adventurer to be suddenly forced to act as the leader of a bad person without even knowing what she really was saying. She said that she would accompany the spirit in case she got caught」</p>
<p>Mareficent stared into the void. It seems he could see spirits too.</p>
<p>「I never thought I’d send so many of them, but... I guess they have a purpose to warn Black Lightning Princess-dono. The guild would do whatever it takes to anger Klimt-san after all. It’s nothing for me to be sandwiched between them」</p>
<p>Magic Disruption Magic Claws, Serpent Dragon Collar</p>
<p>「Klimt-san, have you regained your old strength and are now Rank S? I’m the one who’s going to get hit with the brunt of it all...」</p>
