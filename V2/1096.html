</div><h1>Chapter 1096</h1><p>「Anyway, what we would like to ask you to do this time is to search for Raydoss’s secret agent, as well as to uncover a nobleman who may be rebellious against the country」</p>
<p>「Should we capture a nobleman?」</p>
<p> Grandma Esmeralda, who suddenly started talking about the details of the request, was quite shocked. Fran was also confused. It was still okay to look for a secret agent. They would probably fall into the work of an adventurer just in time. But was it also her job to ask adventurers to hunt down nobles that have rebelled against a country? But was finding out the nobles who rebelled against the country a job that adventurers were asked to do?  </p>
<p>「Aah, I can’t say I’m leading the way, you know?  But we don’t have enough strength.  I’m going to use whatever we can use. Besides, you don’t need to hide that information」</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>「This is. I’ve heard it was originally from you, you know?」</p>
<p>  What Esmeralda pulled out was a paper.  It was a list of things, with letters sludgy on it.  I looked closely and realized that. This list was quite close to the list of black market slavers we had obtained.  And that was supposed to be the case. He extracted only the names of nobles and merchants from the customer list in the Kranzel Kingdom.  </p>
<p>「Hiyaahaha.  I brought it out at a good time.  Now there’s not many idiots who would crush it, and thanks to your name, it’s more reliable. You’re underestimating her like she’s thinking nothing, aren’t you?」</p>
<p>  And something like that! </p>
<p>「That was the perfect time, huh?  Kukuku.  The slave trade is forbidden by the laws of my nation.  Ignoring it means I’m gonna be crushed. I’ve got a good reason for doing so.」</p>
<p>「But if you crush so many nobles at once, you’re gonna be in trouble......」</p>
<p> Esmeralda laughs at the maid’s words.  </p>
<p>「Hah!  So what’s wrong?  While I’m drinking my tea so gracefully, the dark side also warmed up a lot.  Are you sure you’re gonna be underestimated?  I’m afraid.  If you go against the dark parts of the world, it’s gonna get boring. By making people think that way, it can serve as a deterrent and will lead to the stability of the country」</p>
<p>「...B-but!」</p>
<p>「But don’t!  Kill your enemies!  Shut up any doubts!  If you’re suspicious, thoroughly investigate!  That’s the dark area!  Most of the time, why are you disobeying my words? Now that little girl is out of the question!」</p>
<p>「...... Hii!」</p>
<p>「!」</p>
<p>  For a moment, Esmeralda emitted a tremendous killing intent.  It was a dense, deep, deep-sea, deep-seated killing intent. The maid, who seemed to be a decently high-ranking person in the dark, even trembled with a pale face.  Fran was also bracing herself for a moment.  As expected of a former commander of the dark, she was very intimidating. Even though she looked weak, it must mean that she was a disguise that we couldn’t see through.  </p>
<p>「You’re terrible, young miss, you’ve been disciplined too well by these young girls. After all, I have to re-train them all the time」</p>
<p>「Nn.  You’re okay」</p>
<p>「Hiyaahaha! It’s impressive that you don’t need to change your complexion at all!」</p>
<p>「Anyways, you’re requesting us to do this?」</p>
<p>「Oh, yes, that’s right.  The old man shouldn’t have a long conversation.  After Ashtner’s stupid incident, his men were considerably crushed.  However, there are still many nobles in the royal capital who are connected to Raydoss.  It is highly likely that they are protecting Raydoss secretaries. Is it okay enough to go this far?」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>「I want to destroy the nobles lying in Raydoss, but it will take a long time for their secretaries.  If that’s the case, then I’ll destroy it with a different suspicion. That’s what this list is all about」</p>
<p>  I see.  So we’re going to catch them up on the suspicion of slave trafficking, not on the suspicion of a conflict with Raydoss.  </p>
<p>「It has the power and stealth.  Besides, we know the list of suspects, so there’s no problem with the information we have. I’d love for you to accept the request if at all possible, what do you think?」</p>
<p>  Esmeralda put out a request letter to us.  From the looks of it, it should be no problem.  </p>
<p>(Master, can I?)</p>
<p>『Yeah, he’s the one we’re dealing with.』</p>
<p>  The nobles involved in the slave trade would consider Fran as an enemy on par with Raydoss. They would rather wish for Fran to destroy the slaves against the background of her nation’s power.  It was inevitable that Fran would want to accept this request.  </p>
<p>「... Okay.  I’ll take this request」</p>
<p>「O-ooh! Thank you!」</p>
<p>  But still, it’s only a few days since we’ve provided them with the list.  Were trying to cover it up or something? When Fran raised her question, Esmeralda smirked.  </p>
<p>「That note had some signs of a firm contract.  It was probably not just the name of the customer but a magic document. Well, I guess it was used to threaten the nobles eventually」</p>
<p> We didn’t understand, but it seemed that alchemists could read through it.  Moreover, the signs and seals on it were consistent with the contract they had previously sealed with the slavers. The Kranzel Kingdom judged that they were as reliable as possible.  Besides, the nobles on the list were all originally members of the Marquis Ashtner faction.  The government was still looking for an excuse to intervene. Even if it was near a difficult habit, they want to destroy it now. </p>
<p>「Can you tell me that much?」</p>
<p>「You’re fine.  I’m half related, and I’ll be working for you this time too.  So, please take care of it, won’t you?」</p>
<p>「Nn.  I’ll leave it to you」</p>
<p> Esmeralda seemed to be planning to move immediately. She threw something at her.  </p>
<p>「Take care of it, young miss.」</p>
<p>「What is this?」</p>
<p>「This is a mask that has the effect of blocking perception」</p>
<p>  It was a Venetian mask type that covered her eyes, not a mask that could be worn around her mouth.  It was jet-black and gold-colored. </p>
<p>「I don’t have any defense, but I can’t remember my face anymore.  I don’t think it’s okay if a nobleman hates me. So, it’s time to wear it」</p>
<p>「Okay」</p>
<p>『This is a good item』</p>
<p> I was wondering how to disguise it, but it was resolved at once.  </p>
<p>「You’ll return it when the request is over. </p>
<p>『You know―』</p>
<p>  I definitely wanted someone like an assassin. </p>
<p>「First of all, we’ll need you to go to the noble’s mansion, which has been showing signs of suspicious movements lately.」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>「It’s someone to crush anyway. You can do this without mercy.」</p>
<p>「Okay.」</p>
<p>『Wait! We have to hold back!』</p>
<p>(?)</p>
<p>「You’ll return it when the request is over, so it’s a very dangerous item for you to use.」</p>
<p>『You know―』</p>
<p> I definitely wanted someone like an assassin. </p>
<p>「First of all, we’ll need you to go to the noble’s mansion, which has been making some suspicious moves lately.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「You’re the one to crush it anyway. You can do this without mercy.」</p>
<p>「Okay.」</p>
<p>『Wait! We have to hold back!』</p>
<p>(?)</p>
<p>If Fran doesn’t hold back, there’ll be more damage to her than just her mansion!</p>
