</div><h1>Chapter 1113</h1><p>「Sword God Transformation!」</p>
<p>『Divine Energy Manipulation, Spirit’s Hand in Hand! And Evil Spirit’s Hand! This is the critical moment! Fragment of the Evil God! Please!』</p>
<p>I fused the Divine Attribute I created with the Evil Attribute’s magic power that flowed from the Evil God Fragment into me in an even greater amount than before.</p>
<p>And then Fran’s black lightning added to that, shone so much light that my blade was not normally visible.</p>
<p>「Let’s go.」</p>
<p>『Yeah! Let’s do this!』</p>
<p>Normally, they would jump up in the air and apply the momentum of the fall to their attacks. But this time, we have to consider the damage to the town.</p>
<p>Fran didn’t leap into the air and ran as if she were crawling through the earth.</p>
<p>Even the Great Spirit could sense our current danger.</p>
<p>She unleashed an enormous amount of attacks, some even cute words like “hard to beat” or “unbelievable”. After all, there were no gaps anywhere between them, and Fran managed to break open while parrying the attacks that seemed to take up the space itself.</p>
<p>It shattered down five layers of barrier in an instant, leaving only one of them left. But for Fran, that single instant was enough.</p>
<p>With a speed on par with instant movement, she was able to reach the feet of the Great Spirit in no time at all.</p>
<p>There must be a nucleus of the Great Spirit up ahead. The faint movement of Maal’s magic power in Fran must have been a little bit of a support for her.</p>
<p>Fran folded the arms she held me up and pulled me back.</p>
<p>An enormous amount of magic power then growled as it ran all over Fran’s body, reacting to my magic and flashing a violent flash of light.</p>
<p>Then, as if to take full advantage of the power of the earth she stepped on, Fran pushed me out while extending. I could feel that all the power was concentrated on my sword blade and put a tremendous burden on me.</p>
<p>「Ruaaaaaaaah!」</p>
<p>『Uwooooh!』</p>
<p>A thrust out to twist toward the sun floating in the sky pierced the Great Spirit.</p>
<p>Maybe it was the effect of the Sword God Transformation, but the power of the thrust was more than expected. Let’s just say that it’s a thrust version of the Heaven Judgement?</p>
<p>It felt as if I could penetrate through space, no matter what kind of person I was with. I was feeling an all-powerful feeling that was close to my certainty as I was pierced by a spirit.</p>
<p>With the feeling of clashing with something hard, the wind that made up the Great Spirit was blown away. The outline of its body wavered as if the Great Spirit’s power had been greatly reduced. I had been absorbing its magic power to further reduce its power, but...</p>
<p>I saw something flying far away at tremendous speed. I thought it had substance in its nucleus and that it had flown away, but it looked like a longer, thinner rod with an artificial appearance.</p>
<p>What surprised me was not that such a thing was inside the Great Spirit, but that it was sturdy enough to maintain its shape even after being thrust with all our might.</p>
<p>The moment I became aware of the mysterious object, I felt a chill on my spine. I flew so far that I couldn’t see it anymore, but should I go to retrieve it? But Fran held her ears before moving.</p>
<p>「Muh...!」</p>
<p>『Is it the voice of the great spirit?』</p>
<p>「Nn. I’m screaming......」</p>
<p>This attack itself was a great success. I could tell that Fran’s thrust had definitely shattered and weakened the Great Spirit’s power.</p>
<p>Not only was it thanks to the divine and evil energy, but the Sword God must have accurately shot through the weakest part of the Great Spirit.</p>
<p>And despite the tremendous amount of power contained in the thrust, there was no wave in the surrounding area. All of its energy was concentrated in the thrust, even though there was strong magic power gushing out in the line of fire of the thrust.</p>
<p>If these had been released towards the town, dozens of houses would have been destroyed, wouldn’t they?</p>
<p>「Phew.」</p>
<p>『I’ve gotten a bunch of durability values from you......』</p>
<p>Both Fran and I were severely worn out by just one blow. We wouldn’t be able to unleash the same attack again today.</p>
<p>(Something’s wrong, Mar.)</p>
<p>『What? Could it be, you’ve used too much power?』</p>
<p>(Hmm? On the contrary?)</p>
<p>『On the contrary, you mean you’re feeling better?』</p>
<p>(Something like that.)</p>
<p>Do they have something to do with it? Did they suck something out? However, I couldn’t afford to take a slow look at the Great Spirit’s condition. The Great Spirit had started attacking it again. It was weaker than before, but it was still more intense.</p>
<p>『Let’s get out of here!』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>I was born several decades ago, it seems. Not that it means much to me considering how I don’t remember living that long myself.</p>
<p>We began to move away from the Great Spirit, praying that Klimut would do better.</p>
<p>It seemed that she was still hearing the spirits’ screams, and Fran looked a bit reluctant all the time. She seemed meaningless if she tried to hold her ears. She had been in anguish for a long time.</p>
<p>However, her expression suddenly softened.</p>
<p>「The voice of the spirit has stopped」</p>
<p>『Oh! The spirits are starting to disappear!』</p>
<p>Immediately after Fran muttered, something strange happened to the Great Spirit. The Great Spirit, which had been in the form of a giant woman, lost its outline as if melting into the void.</p>
<p>When I looked at Klimt, I saw that he had protruded his arms to release magic power. And apparently, the people who were trying to seal him and repatriate him were in the middle of a big battle.</p>
<p>The more magic power Klimt released, the more the spirit disappeared. In return, the wind began to swirl around Klimt.</p>
<p>It was only a slight breeze at first, but it quickly turned into a whirlwind and now a tornado. Fran and the others hurriedly moved away from us. The wind continued to gain even more momentum.</p>
<p>A-Are you sure that Klimut will be fine? It’s not like he’s being attacked, is it? His life force has diminished...</p>
<p>I was a little worried, but it seemed like they were okay. The tornado had lost its power little by little, and disappeared as if it were sucked into Klimut.</p>
<p>At the same time, the magic power released by the Great Spirit disappeared from our sight.</p>
<p>Even though I shouldn’t have been able to feel any presence of the spirit, the air in the town had softened, or some kind of strange sense of intimidation, disappeared.</p>
<p>『Did you see it......?』</p>
<p>「Klimt!」</p>
<p>Immediately after that, Klimut collapsed on the spot.</p>
