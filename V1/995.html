</div><h1>Chapter 995</h1><p>The golden light ran around freely in the vast underground space, fortunately hitting them and dissipating the antidemons. Trismegistus’ extinction speed seemed to be rising rapidly, not slowing down.</p>
<p>I couldn’t see the bottom of its strength.</p>
<p>(Master?)</p>
<p>『No, it’s nothing』</p>
<p>Before I knew it, I felt a shiver run down my face. I could feel my human senses shaken. It was the fear and uneasiness that welled up.</p>
<p>After this, we have to meet and talk to that monster. What if its power is directed at Fran?</p>
<p>The fact that she was not a person I could trust, both mentally and physically, made me feel more anxious than necessary.</p>
<p>But we were not enemies now. Rather than worrying about the future, let’s watch the battle of Trismegistus first.</p>
<p>As I was desperately chasing after the high-speed battle with my own eyes, I noticed the changes that were beginning to occur in Trismegistus.</p>
<p>『Her vitality is diminishing...?』</p>
<p>「Yeah.」</p>
<p>Fran stared at Trismegistus with a puzzled look on her face as she heard me mutter. It was not just my imagination after all.</p>
<p>Fine scratches had remained on Trismegistus’ entire body, and he was clearly beginning to take damage.</p>
<p>「What’s wrong, Miss Hilt?」</p>
<p>「Trismegistus, I’m not under attack yet, but I’m bleeding.」</p>
<p>「Aah, that one」</p>
<p>When Isario heard Fran’s mutter, for some reason, she directed her eyes toward the gold dragonkin as if she was looking at pity.</p>
<p>「The ship is still moving like that. There’s a terrifying burden on Trismegistus’ body. It’s enough to eat his life」</p>
<p>They were using Divine Dragon Form and continuing to move at their full strength. That would mean they were not safe. It was just like Fran using Brilliant Lightning Rush and Potential Release to fight with everything she has in her hands.</p>
<p>「Are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Don’t be okay. We’ll lose ourselves if things continue like this」</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>「They call me Immortal, but I’m a little different. To be more precise, I’ll resurrect you when you’re on the verge of death, in the throne room. That’s the Immortal Curses that he put on me」</p>
<p>They couldn’t leave the castle grounds and would suffer endless intense pain if they had to kill the antidemons. Then, even if they died, they would be resurrected and forced to fight. That was the true nature of the curse placed on Trismegistus.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the fact that he can be resurrected even if he dies, he uses strengthening skills that can self-destruct due to exhaustion at full power. This is the secret of Trismegistus’ strength.</p>
<p>In fact, if we hadn’t done that, we wouldn’t have been able to exterminate that many antidemons every day.</p>
<p>Fran had a subtle expression on her face as I was horrified at the intensity of Trismegistus.</p>
<p>『Fran, what’s wrong?』</p>
<p>「......Nn.」</p>
<p>Is the emotion on Fran’s face a pity?</p>
<p>Come to think of it, Trismegistus was now enslaved by the Gods. If we didn’t feel like the great sinner who had killed the world, we might just be affected.</p>
<p>The harshness of the story of how they had to keep resurrecting and fighting for eternity without being able to leave the castle made me a little backlash.</p>
<p>Living in a luxurious castle would not be a comfort for any of us.</p>
<p>「Mrgh.」</p>
<p>『Juanaverta, it’s glowing.』</p>
<p>Falcion’s Juanaverta, who seemed to be an Intelligence Weapon, released a silver light at her blade.</p>
<p>It seemed that she could release magic power to stretch her blade. The sharpness of the blade was at the level of cutting antidemons like test-run straws.</p>
<p>To put it simply, I might have lost. Was it its original ability? Or was it the effect of Trismegistus’ magic power?</p>
<p>Anyways, he seemed to have the abilities befitting of the strongest dragonkin’s beloved sword.</p>
<p>Isario must have noticed that Fran was staring at Juanaverta. Then he opened his mouth.</p>
<p>「Young miss. Are you interested in the sword of Trismegistus?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「I see. Then I’ll give you a piece of advice」</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>「When it comes to that sword, Trismegistus will be flustered. I’m not interested in anyone――or in other words, I don’t know what he’ll serve when the sword is tangled up.」</p>
<p>Trismegistus was the only sword he had, and his partner was the silver-white Falcion. Everyone was interested in him.</p>
<p>Some of them tried to analyze or deprive their swords. Some tried to forgive them without reproaching them, while others twisted their heads just by asking them to touch them.</p>
<p>She didn’t look angry at us at that time either.</p>
<p>It was just because I needed to kill it. Someone told me to kill it. So I killed it. That looked like what it looked like.</p>
<p>「It’s not like I’m angry at you for doing this. I only know where the mines are when the sword is tangled up.」</p>
<p>『Well, that was pretty frightening』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p>「......Are you sure? This is gonna be a long story」</p>
<p>「So, if you feel something’s off, just run away. No matter what you do, we’ll be on the losing side.」</p>
<p>「Okay」</p>
<p>Fran nodded, but was it safe to talk to Trismegistus in the first place? We came to see Juanaverta, thinking that we might find some clues to prevent me from going crazy.</p>
<p>But if that were to put Fran’s life in danger, it would be a disaster.</p>
<p>『Fran, don’t you think you have to force him to listen to us?』</p>
<p>(No.)</p>
<p>『But I don’t know...』</p>
<p>(I’ll definitely listen to her!)</p>
