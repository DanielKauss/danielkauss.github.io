</div><h1>Chapter 1045</h1><p>『Finally, it’s been a few days since we fought the giant antidemons on this continent, huh?』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p> After completing all the aftermath, Fran――well, Fran had returned to the western port. Her employer, Brunen, had taken us by surprise in many ways, but they told us that this was the best result. At first, we only planned to talk to Trismegistus after hunting and training antidemons and visiting graves... At first, I planned to hunt and train antidemons, and then talk to Trismegistus after visiting a grave... It turned out to be a huge adventure, several times larger than we had expected. The Seven Sages brought together knights from various countries, and I, Fran, and Urushi were several times stronger than we had originally planned.  </p>
<p>「Long time no see on board」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  Fran stared at the harbor from the deck of the ship, squinting against the sea breeze. In less than an hour, we were planning to set sail for the continent of Jilbard. </p>
<p>『We’ve done our greetings and used up all of our antidemon points.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>  antidemon points can’t be taken outside the continent. It’s just like a virtual currency on the continent of Gordicia. No matter how much we hold, it would be meaningless if we left Gordicia.  Well, I guess it’s a measure to keep adventurers on the continent of Gordicia for as long as possible. It can’t be used on other continents, but it’s a limited currency that can be played around freely in Gordicia. Well, I’m sure it would be hard for us to move away from our large holdings.  I don’t know what this system will do in the future.  If the number of antidemons were to dwindle for almost thirty years, the low-ranking adventurers would not be able to make any money. The cycle of living with points should break down.  Trismegistus’ warnings also had no effect on this. Not everyone would leave immediately, but the tide that the weak should not be allowed into the continent should be getting stronger. The agenda of the meetings had already been discussed, and there was a repeated argument that residents, low-ranking adventurers, and fledgling soldiers should not be allowed into the continent.  If that was the case, the antidemon point system itself might have to be changed in some way.  Well, we’d just use up all of it after thinking about it from the bigwigs. Since it was not transferable, we had no choice but to use it.  What we bought with points was mainly building materials such as stone. We had donated them to the towns affected by the incident.  No, no, I couldn’t come up with any other ways to use them. It would be food and medicine to make sure that we had a large amount of them in our possession.  However, we needed more residents on this continent than we did. We couldn’t afford to cause chaos by buying all of it, and even if we stocked up and handed it out on our own, there might be people who were troubled because of the bias in the distribution. As a result of our deliberations, we had decided to look for building materials that were normally difficult to transport at a reasonable price.As a result of their deliberations, they decided to pay a reasonable price for the building materials, which were usually difficult to transport.  So much so that people mistakenly thought they were building a castle.  As we handed out the materials, we greeted those who had helped us. Replare, the guildmaster, and Dandy submaster, who were struggling to get the guild going.  Kozon and the other adventurers who went with Nadia to rescue us.  Mea, Quina, and the other Beast Kingdom members who worked hard for the beastmen on this continent. The hydrangeas of Miranleil Hagane, who was currently staying in Nocta because she needed to keep up with the Holy Nation. Meanwhile, Drulay, the rabbit beastman who had become Fran’s underling, and the rest of the underworld were here.  Chelsea, the dragonkin who assisted them, and Tzaluta, the mercenary.The underworld, including Drulay, the rabbit beastman who became Fran’s apprentice, Chelsea, the dragonkin who fought with him, and Tzaluta, the mercenary.  Ashwrath was trapped deep in the continent to quell his Mad Ogre.  Everyone spared no pains to leave Fran.  We had a request to stay on this continent for a while, but Fran refused.  The request was for us to send her employer, Brunen, to the continent of Jilbard. Besides, Fran’s goal of breaking the curse of the entire Black Cat Kin was not something that could be achieved on this continent, and I couldn’t grow because I don’t have any magic stones.  </p>
<p>「Fran.  You took good care of me, haven’t you?」</p>
<p>「Come to our country next time, Orfalve, Jayne.」</p>
<p>  Two Queens appeared with almost no accompanying us.  They came all the way to see us off. They shook Fran’s hand as she disembarked from the ship and worked hard in their mouths.  </p>
<p>「When you see Gallus, tell me that you greeted me.」</p>
<p>「Please take a breather.」</p>
<p>  Come to think of it, he was Garrus’ stepdad and Jean’s old mother.  I forgot about him because he looked young. With them as the beginning, we saw them off one after another.  </p>
<p>「Fran! You’re coming, Velmeria.  Is it okay for you to go with your mom?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, Frederick is still following me.」</p>
<p> It was Velmeria who approached us casually. It seemed that the friendship they had built up with us had grown even stronger than before through the battle. </p>
<p>「I’m sorry about your skill......」</p>
<p>「It can’t be helped then.  Besides, That was only a burden for me.  In fact, I’m grateful now.」</p>
<p>  I’ve heard about the Divine Dragon Form I had stolen from her. Well, I can’t bring it back, so I just came to the conclusion that it couldn’t be helped.  I was prepared to be resented more, but Velmeria didn’t seem to care. I hope I can return it to her eventually... </p>
<p>「Fran-chan!」</p>
<p>「Isario, are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Oi oi.  That’s a lot of words. She was supposed to be busy with the aftermath, but she came all the way out to see us off.  Fran realized that and smiled happily. She must have missed Isario a lot.  </p>
<p>「Aunt Nadia, did you know Isario?」</p>
<p>「Just in case.  Oops, sorry Isario-dono」</p>
<p>「No, you’re getting sick, right? You shouldn’t push yourself too hard.」</p>
<p>  At the same time as Isario, Nadia and Mulsani came to see us off, but they seemed to know each other. Even if they had never talked to each other before, they seemed to know each other’s strength that was fighting on the continent. Isario supported Nadia, who hadn’t been able to walk properly yet.  </p>
<p>「Fran.  Thanks for the sword.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>  Nadia, who had lost Overgrowth, handed over the magic sword she had stolen from Resalva, the elder of the dragonkin. It should be a perfect weapon for her on her way to the Beast Kingdom.  </p>
<p>「Don’t be reckless, okay?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Meet her again!」</p>
<p>「Fran-dono!  Be careful!」</p>
<p>「Thank you very much for all the things you have done.」</p>
<p>  Diggins, Yagilale, and William the muscular elf, also came to greet us.  We had made many connections on this continent as well. It was a scene that I could experience.  </p>
<p>『We’re about to leave, Brunen is calling you』</p>
<p>「Nn...  It’s about time」</p>
<p>「Fran. Don’t cry, Hilt......」</p>
<p>  Hilt left the continent with Fran and wiped her tears away.  Colbert and Phobos were also there with her.  They had also lost a few disciples. I’m sure they had a lot of feelings for each other.  But still, it was up to the adult to take care of Fran.  </p>
<p>「......! This song!」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>『Yeah!』</p>
<p> Sophie stood at the end of the harbor leash.  She was staring at the passing ships as she played harp. That song I had heard many times before.  </p>
<p>「An adventurer’s song......」</p>
<p>  Sophie’s performance must have reached the adventurers who had come to see her off.  Out of nowhere, she started singing.  The circle of singing extended not only to the seeers but even to those who were not connected to the harbor. Everyone seemed to enjoy singing it.  </p>
<p>「Don’t lose huh... ♪ Let’s move―♪ Show me your pride♪」</p>
<p>「Get up!  This is where the show ends!」</p>
<p>「Show me your best!」</p>
<p>「We’re following you!」</p>
<p>「We’re adventurers~...♪」</p>
<p> Fran hugged Urushi and buried her face in his fur.</p>
<p>「Everyone, see ya...」</p>
