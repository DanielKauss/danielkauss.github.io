</div><h1>Chapter 1027</h1><p>Sophie let loose annihilation, falling to the ground with a torrent of blood spraying from her mouth and eyes.</p>
<p>Her body twitched lightly and she was unable to get up.</p>
<p>「Sophie!」</p>
<p>Fran shouted, but Fran herself, who controls a large amount of magic power, could not move either.</p>
<p>『I’ll help you. Fran, focus!』</p>
<p>(Master, please.)</p>
<p>I transformed my cord into the shape of a hand and gently picked up Sophie’s body. The sound of her heart was quiet and her body was surprisingly cold. I tried to heal her with healing magic, but that didn’t work.</p>
<p>I used my Great Magic Skill to keep calling on Greater Heal, which was imbued with the Divine Attribute. However, Sophie’s heartbeat was just getting weaker. I really wanted to talk to her and encourage her, but I couldn’t talk to her. Because she hadn’t revealed my true identity to Sophie.</p>
<p>No, this was not the time to say that. She was in a state of death due to damage to the Divine Attribute. We should have done whatever we could to help.</p>
<p>Fran would be saddened when Sophie died, and I didn’t hate her either. After all, she was not a dying girl in this situation.</p>
<p>『Sophie, hang in there! I’m healing you now!』</p>
<p>(...Fran’s sword...?)</p>
<p>『Did you notice it?』</p>
<p>(It was a song, it connected, so... I’ll figure it out......)</p>
<p>As expected of a musician! She must have conveyed me to her through a song that connected everyone like an adventurer’s song.</p>
<p>But this girl should be fine. I don’t think she was making any mistakes, and Fran would reveal it to us soon enough.</p>
<p>『I’m sorry. I stopped Fran from telling her not to reveal my identity after all』</p>
<p>(I know......)</p>
<p>She wasn’t angry at us. Besides, Sophie’s condition was getting better and better little by little.</p>
<p>It seemed that Greater Heal, with a hint of Divine Attributes, was working too. I also thought that the effect of exposing its true identity was a little too strong.</p>
<p>While I was healing Sophie, the battlefield moved further.</p>
<p>「Ahahaha! I’ll do it now!」</p>
<p>Jayne, the queen of demonkin, held up a huge book with a big smile.</p>
<p>「Come out! The strongest and oldest king in the world!」</p>
<p>What emerged from the larger magic circle than ever was a golden coffin. From the gold coffin engraved with countless skulls, a divine energy emanating from it that felt chilling even before it opened.</p>
<p>「Our ancestors and first contractors! Inhale life and materialize! Necro Dovey!」</p>
<p>「Nuhahaha! It’s been a long time since I’ve lived in this world!」</p>
<p>What emerged from the gold coffin was a mummy with the appearance of the spirits we had summoned earlier. The equipment was probably a little luxurious, but there was no significant difference in appearance.</p>
<p>He was wearing a robe made of silver threads, with a whole body armor shining in gold on each finger. All of them had a vulgar shine. However, the energy emitted by the mummy had become a moderate ornament showing her power. That was just how impressive the presence that the main body of the armor was.</p>
<p>「It’s a bad deal, but I don’t have time. I’ll cut that big monster in pieces and send it to hell!」</p>
<p>「......Okay Fran, I can see that doesn’t apply to you.」</p>
<p>As Necro Dovey waved his hand floating in the sky, a large scythe appeared. It was a jet-black scythe covered in evil magic power, and the name “death-sized” sounded just like that.</p>
<p>The necro with a fierce smile flew toward the giant antidemon. It was probably because it was a spirit or something, and it was gliding around.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, while it was strong, it seemed to require a high price to use. Magic power was flowing in at a tremendous pace from Jayne to the necro. It was as if life was being sucked out of her.</p>
<p>At this rate, she wouldn’t be able to summon them for a few minutes.</p>
<p>「Nuhahahahaa!」</p>
<p>I saw the power absorbed from Jayne flowed from the necro to the scythe. In an instant, the size of his death became huge. It was probably 20 meters long.</p>
<p>The necro then raised its extraordinary scythe lightly and stuck it as hard as it could in the middle of the giant antidemon.</p>
<p>It seems that the giant antidemon, which had been depleting its power with Sophie’s song of demise, had also greatly reduced its defenses. The giant death-sized antidemon went deep into the earth.</p>
<p>「Life, break it up!」</p>
<p>With the shouts of the necro, the size of his death turned black and disappeared as if he were sucked into a giant antidemon.</p>
<p>「Gyieeeeeee!」</p>
<p>Just as we thought we heard the screams of the giant antidemons, magic power drained from her entire body, cracked from the inside, and crumbled to pieces.</p>
<p>I guess the death size had the effect of debilitating and killing the target’s life force. The fact that even that giant antidemon could not fully stop debilitating may have killed any magic beast or person at all. It was the strength befitting our trump card.</p>
<p>But we hadn’t defeated it yet.</p>
<p>「Ahaha...... To think you can’t defeat it with that much. Too bad.」</p>
<p>Jayne lost her stance and one knee while laughing. Meanwhile, the necronomicon twisted, losing its form as a letter and returning to the dagger. I guess it meant we reached our limit.</p>
<p>「Aah, I can’t use it anymore. I’ll leave the rest to you...」</p>
<p>Jayne fell to the ground after saying that. That wasn’t the case either! However, I saw healing power overflowing from the pendant on her chest.</p>
<p>Apparently, they had countermeasures against the backlash of using the divine sword. Besides, I couldn’t afford to go help anymore.</p>
<p>Fran is ready. She will take a step forward with Urushi, and her eyes will be on the giant antidemons.</p>
<p>《Magical power conduction complete. Maintain it.》</p>
<p>「Let’s go!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Was it the Wolf-Style Sword Drawing Technique? I thought so, but I was a little wrong. The Wolf-Style Sword Drawing Technique, which is the combination of Fran and Urushi, is a technique that struck Fran from the sky with Urushi’s strength.</p>
<p>But this time, Fran had no choice but to grab the small form of Urushi.</p>
<p>『Eh? Fran? Urushi?』</p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>「Woooof!」</p>
<p>Fran ran out and threw Urushi with great force. The current Fran had thrown as much as she could. Urushi flew away with a force that far exceeded the strength of the Great Reeder’s throw.</p>
<p>『Eh? Wai!』</p>
<p>「Ikea!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Urushi, who had turned into a Flying Wolf, grew larger in size in his current state. Urushi was spinning around in a circle and covered his entire body with darkness. It seems that he was planning to add speed, spinning power, dark magic, and Dimensional Fangs to it to give it a big blow.</p>
<p>No magic bullets flew through the air. It was probably because they were now chasing after Isario.</p>
<p>「Grrr!」</p>
<p>「Gigigigyiii!」</p>
<p>Race: Ragnarok Wolf; Demon Wolf; Magic Beast</p>
<p>By concentrating all her power on a single point, a deep crack was drilled into the great antidemon.</p>
<p>『Alright!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>I’d like to praise and stroke her, but now it’s our turn. Or rather, Fran, who had chased after us with the Black Lightning Roll right behind us, had already unleashed a slash.</p>
<p>『Uwooooh! Let’s put all our power into this!』</p>
<p>《Leave the control support to me》</p>
<p>『I leave it to Announcer-san! Get her! Fran!』</p>
<p>「Nn! The Black Lightning God’s Claw! Heavenly Judgment!」</p>
