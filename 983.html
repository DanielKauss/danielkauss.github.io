</div><h1>Chapter 983</h1><p>After defeating Rezalv, we went around defeating the other dragonkin who had lost control, but there was another incident on the battlefield.</p>
<p>『Fran! The antidemons! What’s more, the dragonkin are eager to join us!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>We saw a mixture of dragonkin and antidemon presences in one unit.</p>
<p>So we really did manage the antidemons!</p>
<p>I thought so, but I was wrong. They were neither antidemons nor dragonkin. No, I guess it was more correct to say that they were either of them.</p>
<p>To my surprise, they looked basically dragonkin, but some of their bodies had been turned into antidemons. This was a mixture of both of them.</p>
<p>Moreover, the magic contained in it was on an order of magnitude greater than that of a giant dragonkin. They had a threat level of at least B. There were more than twenty such antidemon dragonkin that rushed toward us from the direction of Trismegistus’ castle.</p>
<p>The ten antidemons running in front of them were evenly balanced, and their silhouettes alone would be similar to that of a human. The ball-shaped presence that seemed to lie behind them was also that of an antidemon dragonkin.</p>
<p>The quality of the magic power emitted was exactly the same for both of them. Depending on one’s abilities and skills, the shape of one’s body may change. That must also have the properties of an antidemon.</p>
<p>「Isario-dono!」</p>
<p>「I know! You’re mine! I’ll leave this to you!」</p>
<p>The antidemon dragonkin were much stronger than the dragonkin who had lost their rationality to go on a rampage on the battlefield. Isario must have thought that it was dangerous for them to be in contact with the second unit. They started moving toward the antidemon dragonkin, accompanied by some of the dragonkin.</p>
<p>We should launch a long-range attack now. That was because we didn’t launch a long-range attack earlier because we were afraid that everyone other than Isario would make hate.</p>
<p>However, because we were now in a disorderly brawl, not many of them would be able to unleash their magic against the new enemy. Even if only Fran and I worked hard, we were still far from at the barrage.</p>
<p>In the end, they still allowed the antidemon dragonkin to approach us without any serious damage. No, they were still more than 300 meters away, but they were well within range.</p>
<p>To my surprise, the humanoid antidemon dragonkin had lifted his sphere-shaped friends above his head and threw them at us.</p>
<p>What kind of strength!</p>
<p>「I’m aiming for the uncle and the Militant Nation of Hagane, huh!? I hate you!」</p>
<p>The magic power overflowing from the inside and the body that began to tear slightly unbearable from that pressure. Half of the ball-shaped antidemon dragonkin, which could only be thought of as a suicide attack, were thrown toward Isario and the other half towards the carriage of the Militant Nation of Hagane.</p>
<p>There was no doubt that their enemy was aiming for a Divine Sword.</p>
<p>『Fran, take care of Hagane! I’ll help Isario!』</p>
<p>「Okay!」</p>
<p>『Urushi, interfere with the movement of a humanoid!』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>The magic power of that ball-type antidemon dragonkin was so vicious that it gave me chills. A single shot would be enough power to cast several extremely powerful magic spells. Each shot was made up of five of them.</p>
<p>No matter how much Isario tried, if he didn’t use his Divine Sword, he wouldn’t be able to completely offset it. And if he wanted to protect the adventurers, Isario would surely release his Divine Sword without hesitation.</p>
<p>『It might be hard to defeat it, but it’s enough to knock it down!』</p>
<p>I activated Dimensional Magic and full-power telekinesis at the same time. Aside from telekinesis, Dimensional Magic was not so easy for me to control while doing other things. But I had no choice but to do it.</p>
<p>Well, it was not like I didn’t hate good-natured men either!</p>
<p>『Turn Shield!』</p>
<p>I couldn’t create a dimension gate that could move that huge body. Then I changed my trajectory.</p>
<p>This was a technique used to distort space and divert the trajectory of the flying tool, but it could also work on larger objects if it concentrated a large amount of magic power.</p>
<p>One of the ball-shaped antidemon dragonkin made contact with the turn shield and changed its trajectory drastically. It quickly turned to the right, like a ball of change thrown by a professional baseball player.</p>
<p>At the same time, the other one, who had been changed the course with telekinesis, slipped to the left.</p>
<p>The antidemon dragonkin were violently clashing with each other in the air, and the impact was tremendously repelled.</p>
<p>The destination was probably far removed from the battlefield where the second unit was. There might have been a shock in the aftermath, but it was better than a direct hit.</p>
<p>I also used wind magic in succession to try to divert its trajectory. However, it did not go well because of the barrier.</p>
<p>Even so, she managed to concentrate all her magic into one shot and succeeded in defeating it. She then dropped it halfway between the second unit and the humanoid.</p>
<p>But I forced myself to use too much magic.</p>
<p>『The limit of continuous activation is...! What should we do with two more times...!?』</p>
<p>While I was in a hurry, Fran was ready to deal with the ball-shaped antidemon dragonkin that flew over General Hagane’s side.</p>
<p>「Kanna Kamui! Teyaa!」</p>
<p>Fran, who had no telekinesis or Dimensional Magic, was going to use the orthodox method. She must be planning to hit down the Great Magic Beast with a powerful long-range attack anyway.</p>
<p>In addition to my Kanna Kamui, I also fired Sonic Waves in rapid succession. I could see that Fran’s arms were screaming as the unreasonable series of attacks put a high burden on her.</p>
<p>Her skin tears and blood pours out. Her muscles and bones must have been in pain. Still, Fran could not rest her hands and continued to attack.</p>
<p>And she managed to knock down two of them.</p>
<p>But that was the only thing Fran could stop. She stopped moving because she exceeded her limit.</p>
<p>The other magicians began to attack in Fran’s place, but the weak magic had little effect on them due to the powerful barrier.</p>
<p>「At the very least, I need to give up on this attack and focus on defense」</p>
<p>「That’s enough. Leave the rest to me.」</p>
<p>「Mulsani-san.」</p>
<p>Before I knew it, this snow was rushing to the front line.</p>
<p>『Belserk’s abilities are quite powerful, but how far can I go?』</p>
<p>They stared at the flying dragonkin while holding Berserk in a praying pose. It was the same feeling as when they attacked a giant dragonkin.</p>
<p>「He’s dead.」</p>
<p>triggered by her murmurs, the body of a ball-shaped antidemon dragonkin rapidly wilted and began to lose its magic power. Because of its shape, it looked like a ball of air.</p>
<p>However, only two of them were defeated by Zelyse. He seemed to have tried to use more power, but before that, Zelyse had collapsed.</p>
<p>「Kuh...」</p>
<p>Seeing this, Isario must have understood that the opponent was stronger than he had imagined.</p>
<p>She had finally made the decision.</p>
<p>「Divine Sword Release!」</p>
<p>An explosion of magic power then erupted from the Divine Sword.</p>
<p>『I guess I’ll let her use it in the end!』</p>
<p>But this should be fine for the other side. It would be impossible for Isario, who had released his Divine Sword, to fail.</p>
<p>Next, we have to deal with one shot from General Hagane’s side. However, a simultaneous shot of magic rained down from the humanoid.</p>
<p>Apparently, he had seen our army and decided that he could handle them as long as he could interfere with Fran. I wondered if they were in a reckless state, but his situation was more precise!</p>
<p>Fran and I were both so busy putting up barriers that we didn’t have time to unleash any sort of attack.</p>
<p>「Mulsani-san is here too!」</p>
<p>『Fran! I’ll make my barrier even thicker!』</p>
<p>BOOOOOOOM!</p>
