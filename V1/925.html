</div><h1>Chapter 925</h1><p>「Ruaaaaaaaah!」</p>
<p>「Shiii! Sigii!」</p>
<p>「Haa! Teya!」</p>
<p>The battle between Fran and Triangle was entering a realm of divine speed. They both slashed at each other, moving at a speed so fast that even a shadow could not be seen in human eyes.</p>
<p>At first glance, they seemed to be evenly matched, but the battle now seemed to be headed toward Fran. It may not be possible to say that she was proficient in using the Divine Beast Transformation, but it still outmatched even the strongest class of antidemons.</p>
<p>Fran evaded the three-sided swords that were swung around at super high speed while accurately hitting her own slashes. The number of times she did that increased at once, and soon Fran continued to slash one-sidedly.</p>
<p>No matter how high their regenerative power was, they would soon be unable to keep up with the black lightning and slashes imbued with the divine attribute.</p>
<p>The triptych was sliced up by more than a hundred slashes over a period of time that was stretched out. I could feel the multiple layers of swordsmanship that he radiated like an insect cage made of swords.</p>
<p>「Phew.........!」</p>
<p>With a rustling sound of the ground, Fran stopped.</p>
<p>As if her actions had signaled, the three horns had collapsed, their slender bodies scattered all over the earth.</p>
<p>But we hadn’t defeated it yet.</p>
<p>Now I could see the wreckage of the antidemons was desperately trying to move. If left unchecked, it would regenerate and start to move sooner or later.</p>
<p>I’d expect as much from a top-level special individual, the Twisted Horn of Castel. In the face of such an antidemon, Fran thrust her right palm at his opponent.</p>
<p>As if in response to Fran’s concentration, the magic power cloaking her was transformed into black lightning and raged through the area. Then, a large amount of black lightning that gushed out gathered in front of Fran’s palm and shrunk.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, I was floating around a jet-black sphere created by the concentrated black lightning. It looked like a small black hole and looked like a jet-black sphere.</p>
<p>He wriggled so hard that it looked like he could even burst, and he made a high-pitched sound as he shouted “Ojii!”</p>
<p>The intimidation and presence that the black lightning balls exuded was so strong that even I could tremble. I even worried that if it went out of control, the whole area might disappear.</p>
<p>However, Fran didn’t even seem to feel any uneasy, and she released her power with a calm face.</p>
<p>「Black Tiger Lightning Rush!」</p>
<p>Rather than hitting the ball of black lightning, it was more like releasing the black lightning I had stored in my pool at once.</p>
<p>The sudden appearance of extremely thick black lightning like a black dragon shoved forward, swallowing not only the antidemons but also the antidemons around them. The Black Lightning Rush was exactly like a river, engraving long and deep wounds on the plains.</p>
<p>From a distance, it looked like a black dragon was really rushing into us. The ditches were nearly 20 meters wide and extended far into the distance.</p>
<p>Moreover, the scattered black lightning also wiped out the antidemons around the scars.</p>
<p>That was a tremendous power. Was it the Black Tiger Lightning Rush? I guess that was the secret technique of the Divine Beast, the Black Heavenly Tiger.</p>
<p>「I got you, huh...?」</p>
<p>『I made the wrong power distribution.』</p>
<p>She had just learned and was not used to, and used all of her power to the fullest. Fran’s strength and magic power were all gone.</p>
<p>Even with the power of Sophie’s song, it seemed like it would take some time to recover until she was ready for battle. Fran’s movements were so slow that it was hard for her to fall.</p>
<p>『But you did a great job.』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Fran had used up all of her power, but I could still fight. She had used a lot of power to withstand the Divine Attributes that Fran wore, but it was fine enough to scatter magic everywhere.</p>
<p>She had intended to use long-range attacks to cover her comrades――but Urushi’s strong gaze refused to help.</p>
<p>What Urushi is facing is a crimson giant lion with long horns. A little over five meters long body was running around on the battlefield, exchanging blows all the while.</p>
<p>Apparently, Urushi wanted to settle this on his own. He seemed to be burning with rivalry with the enemy who walks on four legs, which is just like him.</p>
<p>Urushi has more magic power than Numerae, but he has the advantage of being superior to other horned lions in terms of pure physical ability.</p>
<p>As they bit each other and wielded their claws, the horned lion’s attacks hit Urushi many times over. He seemed to have a share of the opponent in close combat.</p>
<p>However, Urushi did not stop challenging himself in this super close combat, as if he had become determined. The two sides tangled up and rolled around, getting caught up in a lot of antidemons and disappearing.</p>
<p>Then the battle suddenly ended.</p>
<p>「Grooaah!」</p>
<p>「Gyii―」</p>
<p>The fangs that Urushi had thrust deeply pierced the neck of the horned lion, and the paws that he had slammed into had gouged into its torso.</p>
<p>It was the effect of his Twisted Horn skill. The reason why Urushi insisted on close combat, even if it was impossible, was to keep the darkness of his twilight on the horned lion.</p>
<p>The horned lion continued to be affected by the debuffing effect of his twilight for a long time, and its status and armor continued to weaken. As a result, attacks that were previously only minor wounds were reduced to fatal wounds and were defeated.</p>
<p>This was exactly the method of cutting meat and bones on the ground.</p>
<p>The horned lion, whose limbs had been crushed, was swallowed by the darkness of the magic that Urushi had unleashed. His presence was completely gone.</p>
<p>「Wooo~f!」</p>
<p>Urushi’s shout echoed through the battlefield.</p>
<p>「Urushi, I did it」</p>
<p>『Yeah! You’ve done your best!』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>As Fran approached, she patted her leg lightly, and Urushi barked proudly. It had been a fierce battle that even made him still bleeding from his entire body, but I guess joy was more important than pain.</p>
<p>His tail was waving limply, causing a strong wind.</p>
