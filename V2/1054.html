</div><h1>Chapter 1054</h1><p>『What is Spirit Magic...?』</p>
<p>《...》</p>
<p>I asked back, but Announcer-san didn’t answer. The only thing that happened was that the Automatic Announcer feature had done the job. </p>
<p>『Umm, Fran. What’s wrong?』</p>
<p>「I don’t know」</p>
<p>『I see―...』</p>
<p>What should we do? Do we need to tell Marl what happened and ask him what happened? He was the one who was right, but his appearance was completely human. The strange thing was that he was probably able to fly even though he wasn’t using magic. The strange thing was that he was probably able to fly even though he wasn’t using magic.  What happened to Marl?  When I appraised her, I found out what had happened to her.  Her race had changed from a Demon Demon to a Spirit.  It seemed that as I stabilized her magic power, she had become a spirit. Is that even possible?  Her magic power was quite weak.  Her magic power was also very weak, and her fighting power was probably on par with a D-ranked adventurer. In a sense, it could be said that she had abandoned so much magic power that she went out of control.  </p>
<p>「Maru?」</p>
<p>「Thanks...」</p>
<p>「Mahl!」</p>
<p>「Water dragon...  Please have a wishkal...」</p>
<p>  Marl’s figure quickly became visible and I could see that he was losing his physical form.  His presence then faded at once.  That’s when Marl reached out his hand to Fran. Fran then watched over her without doing anything.  The moment Marl’s fingertip gently touched Fran’s chest――.  </p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>  To my surprise, Marl’s body was sucked in and disappeared into Fran.  Did he assimilate into Fran?  I checked the presence in Fran, but I couldn’t find any signs of Marl’s origin. However, Marl’s proof was definitely there.  </p>
<p>《The individual named Fran’s spirit magic has leveled up》</p>
<p>  The level of spirit magic had increased from 1 to 2, huh?  Does that mean it was a blessing for spirits? Fran put her fist on her chest and closed her eyes.  </p>
<p>「Mal is here」</p>
<p>『Do you know?』</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p> I couldn’t detect it at all. However, it seemed that Fran could clearly feel the power of Marl inside her.  </p>
<p>『Are there any problems?』</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>『Are you sure you can use Spirit Magic?』</p>
<p>「That’s not possible, Marl is asleep」</p>
<p>  She’s asleep, huh?  I used more various skills to search inside Fran, but I still couldn’t find it.  It was as if Marl’s existence was also an illusion. But it was not an illusion. In Fran’s hand, she held an iron collar that had fallen as soon as Marl lost his physical form.  </p>
<p>「...Raidos, Kingdom of Raidos」</p>
<p>  Fran muttered in a dark voice.  I don’t know if she could or couldn’t save him. However, it seemed that Fran’s heart was definitely filled with anger for the Kingdom of Raidos.  They killed each other and exchanged a few words for a short time.  Even though all this was going on, they were sure to understand each other. Maybe there was something similar to their personality. As for me, I’d like to leave them quiet like this, but I can’t say that.  </p>
<p>『Fran.  Let’s free the water dragon』</p>
<p>「That’s right」</p>
<p>  Fran raised her head at once and looked down at the water dragon below her again.  There, she found a water dragon with navy-blue scales that stood quietly and sticking out of the surface of the sea. As Marl said, it did not seem to be raging.  Fran carefully descended to the front of the water dragon. She was braced herself so that she could avoid if it attacked us, but...  </p>
<p>「Krrrrr...」</p>
<p> The water dragon did not attack us at all. It stared at Fran with its eyes, which seemed to be even intelligent, and its throat was trembling thinly. Its voice was sad and sounded as if it was crying.  </p>
<p>「You’re crying?」</p>
<p>『I’m not crying, but... Maybe you can tell that it’s happening to Marl』</p>
<p>「Nn...」</p>
<p>  Fran and the water dragon stared at each other for a short time, and then their neck suddenly stretched toward us.  I braced myself but Fran didn’t move at all. I certainly didn’t feel any hostility, but it was a water dragon, right?  They looked like they were approached by the mouths of a huge carnivorous beast that could swallow, but I couldn’t help but be calm. As expected of Fran.  It seemed that the interest of the water dragon was not directed at Fran but at the collar in its hand. It sniffed the collar while buzzing through the huge nostrils. Fran was having a hard time because of the moist air from her nose! The water dragon’s movements were observed as it tried to purify it.  The water dragon then opens its mouth slightly dexterously and sucked the collar.  </p>
<p>「Krrrrr...」</p>
<p>「... I’m sorry」</p>
<p>  and </p>
<p>「Krrr」</p>
<p>  Fran apologized, but the water dragon shook its head lightly.  The dragonkin was originally intelligent, and this water dragon had lived for over a thousand years. If it wasn’t for you, you could say that they were even brainier than Fran... And for now, they should make a promise to Marl.  </p>
<p>『Fran, you can chain me』</p>
<p>「Nn.  I’ll be free」</p>
<p>「Krrr」</p>
<p>  When Fran raised me, the water dragon showed no sign of caution. It seemed that it understood her words. </p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>  Fran’s aim was the metal torso of the water dragon.  It would be difficult for the water dragon to remove it on its own, and the chain that would connect it to the ship had been extended.  Fran’s blow did not damage the water dragon’s body, but it perfectly sliced through its equipment. I could see that the water dragon was surprised.  Even if it couldn’t use its sword, it could tell just how awesome it was.  The water dragon’s face approached us again.  It seemed that its magic power was concentrated on its forehead and was shining...  Then a soft light emitted from the water dragon’s forehead and covered Fran. It didn’t seem to be aggressive, but what was it?  As I watched in excitement, a light was sucked into Fran’s chest. It was very similar to when Marl was assimilated into Fran.  </p>
<p>「... Water dragon, thank you」</p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>  When Fran thanked her for some reason, the water dragon twisted its body and dived into the sea. I could feel its presence leaving without a trace.  </p>
<p>『Fran, what happened?』</p>
<p>「The water dragon empowered Marl. I can feel Marl more than before」</p>
<p>  Eh?  I don’t know about it at all.  Anyway, I’m glad if it was not a bad thing. Fran muttered sadly as she saw off the water dragon’s presence that was moving away. </p>
<p>「I’ve gone」</p>
<p>『You’re right』</p>
<p>  But it was not yet a complete end.  </p>
<p>『The enemy ship is still there. Urushi is still confused, but the battle is not over』</p>
<p>「...Nn!」</p>
<p>『I’ll vent out that annoying feeling by attacking them』</p>
<p>「Okay」</p>
<p> The remaining Raidos Kingdom’s ship will relieve Fran’s stress.  </p>
<p>「Let’s go!」</p>
<p> Fran, who was so motivated, unleashed her magic at the ship that was going to raise the Raidos Kingdom’s flag.  Since the main body of the water dragonkin was still intact, I thought a barrier would be created, but... It seemed that the barrier stopped working when the water dragon was released. Transferring damage that had been silent for some reason did not occur as well.  When this happened, the ship was probably just a big one. There was a backlash, but it was only sporadic due to confusion and damage.  </p>
<p>「Master!  Get bigger!」</p>
<p>『Ou!』</p>
<p>「Teyaaaaaah!」</p>
<p>  I transformed into a giant, slashed through the battle ship and crushed into pieces by lightning magic.  Some of the soldiers managed to escape to the sea, but they were attacked by the dark wolves created by Urushi’s magic and only stained the sea red.  In addition, Fran boarded the water dragonkin directly. It was because she believed that there was a commander of the Raidos Kingdom here.  Sure enough, there was a handsome man dressed in a luxurious admiral uniform that was different from the others.  He was staring at Fran as she landed on the deck, shaking her huge orc-like body. There were also magicians and knights around her.  </p>
<p>「W-Who are you!?」</p>
<p>「Adventurers」</p>
<p>「Kuh!  How could someone as weak as an adventurer not be that strong!  In the first place, they are very intelligent!  The adventurers, for example, should kneel in front of us! Crawl, you bastard!」</p>
<p>  Ooh, it’s been a long time since I’ve had an adventurer in this town.  I feel like a person from the Kingdom of Raydoss.  However, I have no idea what’s going on.  </p>
<p>「What happened to the alchemist? Where has the little girl gone while you exaggerated to the point that she can’t lose against any opponent!?」</p>
<p>  She probably didn’t watch Marl disappear.  Maybe she felt like she came out later to see Fran go on a rampage. Unlike the admirals who have been summoned, the knights seemed to have a better sense of judgment.  </p>
<p>「Kuh...  What strength is...?」</p>
<p>「Th-that strength?」</p>
<p>「I can’t beat one hundred people or so.」</p>
<p>「F-That’s far enough...」</p>
<p>「The anomaly from earlier...  I’m sure it’s because of this girl......」</p>
<p>  The knights and magicians were whispering such a story.  It seems that the knights were strong enough to see through Fran’s strength.  </p>
<p>「...I should have scrutinized the information coming from the Chancellor more closely...」</p>
<p>「Instead of securing a bridgehead, we can’t be sure that it will be annihilated if we don’t do something about it...」</p>
<p>「T-That’s far enough...」</p>
<p>「I’m sure it’s because of this girl that the anomaly happened earlier...」</p>
<p> The knight and the sorcerer were whispering such a story. It seemed that the knight was strong enough to see through Fran’s strength. </p>
<p>「...I should have scrutinized the information coming from the Chancellor more closely...」</p>
<p>「Instead of securing a bridgehead, we can’t be sure that it will be annihilated if we don’t do something about it...」</p>
<p> It might be better for the negotiations to deal with the knights and magicians than with the admirals, who do not know the current situation.</p>
