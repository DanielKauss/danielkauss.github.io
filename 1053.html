</div><h1>Chapter 1053</h1><p>「...Is this a hell...?」</p>
<p>「No. You don’t know?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, I remember even to the point that my Seedrun was captured by Raydoss’s shit and captured by his big sis......」</p>
<p>It seemed that the plans of the Raidos Kingdom had caused a civil war and they were captured by their big brother, who was a traitor. However, his big brother was also chased by his subordinates who were in the Raidos Kingdom, and the Sea Kingdom of Seedrun was practically controlled by Raidos.</p>
<p>『Is that big brother, Suarez?』</p>
<p>「Sarez?」</p>
<p>「You know him?」</p>
<p>「Nn. I fought one.」</p>
<p>He was a former royalty of the Sea Kingdom of Sydran who used water dragonkin to piracy. Right now――Hmm? What are you doing now?</p>
<p>They must have captured her and handed her over to the Beast Kingdom... But I don’t know what will happen after that.</p>
<p>「We captured them and handed them over to the Beast Kingdom.」</p>
<p>「I see...... So that means my big brother has fallen to the ground too. Well, it’s not something I could say with his body like this......」</p>
<p>Marl stared into his hand and sniffed as if to mock him.</p>
<p>「Haha... When I got back to normal, I became a monster and killed my friends, right? What kind of nightmare...」</p>
<p>She acted confidently, but her inner self must have been filled with sorrow.</p>
<p>Naturally, I turned into a monster when I woke up. I became a sword when I realized it too, but I didn’t pick up my friends or family.</p>
<p>Maar’s long eyelashes were trembling slightly.</p>
<p>「Your race is called the Demon Demon.」</p>
<p>「What the hell is that......? But was it because of this monstrous body that I was able to escape even a little from the curse of slavery...?」</p>
<p>It seemed that the curse of slavery towards humans was completely meaningless to Marle now that she was no longer a human. Even though her collar was still emitting magic power, she didn’t seem to be under her control.</p>
<p>That said, it doesn’t seem to be complete.</p>
<p>「Hmm...... I can’t let myself die.」</p>
<p>Marl tried to thrust his claws into his chest, but his body remained stiff. Apparently, he still had some orders to prevent suicide.</p>
<p>「I’m sorry for someone I didn’t know...... Can you kill me?」</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>「Please do......」</p>
<p>「...The collar might be removed」</p>
<p>「Even so, it was meaningless. I’ve managed to maintain my rationality now, but I can clearly see that I was gone by myself. I don’t know how long I can maintain my rationality without the collar」</p>
<p>Marl looked apologetic, but in a voice of complete silence, he asked Fran to kill him.</p>
<p>「I can only ask you to do this, please. Let me die as a person now.」</p>
<p>「......!」</p>
<p>「That’s impossible, huh?」</p>
<p>The girl’s face on top of her huge body stared at Fran pleadingly. Her tone looked apologetic, but her expression looked like the girl just before she started crying.</p>
<p>「Don’t worry, it’s okay. I’ll cut you down too.」</p>
<p>「Aah, I see...... Thank you.」</p>
<p>Marl exhaled in relief.</p>
<p>『Fran, are you okay?』</p>
<p>「Nn, I’m fine」</p>
<p>The trauma in front of Marl’s face was different from before. He nodded enthusiastically.</p>
<p>It seems that his resolve was decided by the direct plea from Marl.</p>
<p>「My name is Marl, and I’m Mar Seedrun」</p>
<p>「I’m Fran」</p>
<p>「I see... Fran, take care of it」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Marl smiled softly, meditating quietly and drooping quietly. He was in a kneeling position in the air.</p>
<p>She was in a position to risk her life.</p>
<p>Fran then quietly swung me at Marl.</p>
<p>「I’m glad to see you――Fran here. Fuhaha, so short... It’s really short, but I felt something similar, don’t you? I can’t even tell it was the first time I’ve met you」</p>
<p>「Nn. Me too」</p>
<p>「I see. Oh, and also, can you let the water dragon go? If I die, I won’t go berserk. The country is long gone. I can go easy on them.」</p>
<p>「Okay」</p>
<p>「Thank you...... Sis and sisters, I have passed away first......」</p>
<p>「...Good night」</p>
<p>Say hi to the girls. But I could feel a strange reaction from my skill. It was as if the skill was talking to me.</p>
<p>Maybe the skill was trying to respond to Fran’s feelings as the wielder. My intuition told me that I should believe this reaction.</p>
<p>『Fran, let’s just target the magic stones. It’s on the right side of my heart. Can you tell?』</p>
<p>「......I understand.」</p>
<p>Now that Marl had calmed down, she could sense the magic within him. Fran seemed to have understood the position of the magic stones as well.</p>
<p>Instead of swinging it above, she folded her arms and pulled back in a stance that pulled back. Then, she performed her best thrust.</p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>「...!」</p>
<p>Indeed, I felt the magic stone inside Marl pierced through me. A huge amount of magic power then came flowing into me. However, I didn’t have time to enjoy it and activated several skills.</p>
<p>By making full use of the support skills of the Wisdom God’s blessing and information handling, she overworked the use of magic power absorption, spirit detection, spirit hands, great magicians, and gold to the limit.</p>
<p>The most important ones were the Spirit’s Hand and Golden color. It was really faint, but there was a presence of a spirit on it from Marl. At the same time, she growled that the golden color could be used for herself.</p>
<p>The golden color was originally an evolution of the Mixed Slayer skill, which gained a special effect on an existence that consisted of multiple beings. It was effective not only against antidemons but also against beings like Marl.</p>
<p>In addition, the embedded magic stone must have been something similar to a spirit. Therefore, it was possible to interfere with both the spirit’s hand and the gold color.</p>
<p>I don’t think we can let them get back to normal. However, I wonder if we can stabilize their existence and prevent them from running amok.</p>
<p>Normal magic beasts would weaken and die if they lose their magic stones. This may be because they use magic to maintain the various functions of their body, and the disappearance of magic stones is equivalent to the loss of their heart.</p>
<p>But I knew that Marl was originally a human being. I didn’t need a magic stone to survive on him, did I? That seemed to be the case.</p>
<p>『Magic power is pouring out of me...』</p>
<p>「Khraaaaah!」</p>
<p>But it’s not so simple. As if to stabilize his existence, the magic power flowing from him didn’t stop. With Marl’s screams, magic power continues to overflow like a fountain.</p>
<p>『Damn......』</p>
<p>As I was desperately interfering with Marl’s magic power, Fran and Marl suddenly raised their voices.</p>
<p>「This is...... Marl’s magic power?」</p>
<p>「This is...... warm. Is this Fran’s magic power?」</p>
<p>Wh-what do you mean? Fran and Marle’s magic power interfered with each other――.</p>
<p>《Confirming the activation of Spirit Magic. A contract has been signed between the individual named Fran and the individual named Marl Seedrun.》</p>
<p>『Eh? Spirit Magic?』</p>
