</div><h1>Chapter 955</h1><p>「I now understand why you came to this continent, but I have one piece of advice.」</p>
<p>「What is it?」</p>
<p>「You shouldn’t stay on this continent for long. This is not a place where a person with a future like you can stay」</p>
<p>Isario muttered this with a serious look on his face. I could tell that he was really concerned for us from the bottom of his heart.</p>
<p>But Fran didn’t seem to be convinced.</p>
<p>「Isario will be here forever.」</p>
<p>「I’m not a young miss. As I said before, I’m just a normal person with a divine sword」</p>
<p>As I’d expected, Isario’s self-evaluation was quite low. I couldn’t help but understand from what she said earlier.</p>
<p>However, I think she’s getting stronger enough to be an S ranker after decades of fighting on this continent... I guess that means she won’t change much when humans get older.</p>
<p>Isario called himself a talent and played the bad old man――well, I’m guessing half of him was a normal person, but the reason he dared to show his bad figure in front of others was because he felt that if he hadn’t gotten a Divine Sword, he would have been like this.</p>
<p>I also noticed the characteristics of the wielders chosen by Gaia and Ignis. Perhaps they choose those who make the divine sword evil rather than those who do not get carried away even after they have a divine sword.</p>
<p>As a result, it would be unlikely for such people to abuse the Divine Sword or use it for their personal interests. And that’s not all, I don’t doubt that such mental qualities are important.</p>
<p>「Let’s just take this long for a break and get going」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran nodded and stood up. She had tried to use detoxification magic, but before she could, Isario had performed detoxification on himself.</p>
<p>So this guy was able to use recovery magic.</p>
<p>「Magic?」</p>
<p>「You have to have a drink, right?」</p>
<p>「Heal. I have borrowed forces from my master and assembled another forces from this town. I plan to use them」</p>
<p>「Are you sure? Wouldn’t it get worse if I took out the bottle?」</p>
<p>「Uh, okay! This is an investigation request from someone. I-I shouldn’t need to put in a drink or something, it’s better not to have a smell, right?」</p>
<p>Isario, who had pulled out the alcohol, shouted in panic. I guess it’s hard to say that it was a lie. He feels sorry for being too desperate, and he’ll give him a little backup.</p>
<p>『Fran. Isario has a point. The smell of alcohol and the risk of being found by our enemies.』</p>
<p>「I see. Okay.」</p>
<p>「Y-Yeah! That’s exactly what I’m saying」</p>
<p>For some reason, I felt sorry for him, even though he was supposed to be far superior. I thought he was playing half of it, but maybe he was on the same rank as us.</p>
<p>We set out again for the investigation, but we were soon facing something strange. Isario also looked a little serious.</p>
<p>「That’s the Dragonmen Union.」</p>
<p>「Nn. There must be about 30 people」</p>
<p>「Hmmm. There was no guild information to send dragonkin around, but......」</p>
<p>「I have not. Kranzel, Belioth and the rest of the world have been talking about Raydoss as an evil dragonkin.」</p>
<p>However, there was no clearly forbidden land other than the area around the castle of Trismegistus. It would not be a crime to come to this area based on one’s own decision, and it was not surprising.</p>
<p>「I have no choice. Let’s just contact them for now. If they were the rebellious dragonkin from before, I might have to fight them one battle at a time」</p>
<p>「My arms are ringing.」</p>
<p>「How are you, Urushi?」</p>
<p>Isario shrugged his shoulders in a teary manner, but he didn’t smile. He must have noticed the killing intent emanating from Fran.</p>
<p>The story of the Dragon King as the leader of the slavers had been passed down to the Adventurers Guild. Isario must have heard about it as well.</p>
<p>Judging from her story earlier, she must have understood why Fran could not be calm with someone who might be under the Dragon King’s command.</p>
<p>「Don’t attack them until they reach you, okay? If you ever challenge them, we’ll do whatever we want」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「Seriously, I’m begging you」</p>
<p>Three minutes later.</p>
<p>The dragonkin ran toward us after they noticed Fran and Urushi approaching, so the two made quick contact.</p>
<p>Just in case, Urushi was hiding in the shadows. He wanted to disrupt his opponent with a surprise attack if necessary.</p>
<p>「Stop!」</p>
<p>「Who are they!?」</p>
<p>Many of the dragonkin were very young, and they obviously seemed agitated. If we continued to grow a little further, we’ll get ourselves into a thugs.</p>
<p>Their fighting ability was not very high for a dragonkin, and they didn’t seem to have seen through our abilities. And yet, they didn’t seem to doubt their superiority.</p>
<p>All except a few who were yelling at us for intimidating them, were smirking at us.</p>
<p>「Suddenly making a scene. Who are these dragonkin from the reservations?」</p>
<p>「You don’t have to answer, I won’t let you go any further. If you’re leaving quietly, I’ll let you off.」</p>
<p>「Hee―? No, we’re not allowed in. Even though we’ve been asked by the Adventurer’s Guild to investigate it, aren’t we? We haven’t entered such an important information guild though. Who in the world decided to restrict us from entering?」</p>
<p>「...Tsk」</p>
<p>The young man, who was the leader of the group, licked his lips when he saw Isario who didn’t seem to be afraid of him. He was also apparently caught by Isario’s words.</p>
<p>They probably thought Fran to be just a normal adventurer wandering around in search of prey. If that were the official examiner of the guild, then they were worse off than us.</p>
<p>However, the dragonkin’s attitudes were quite stubborn.</p>
<p>「This is our dragonkin continent! What we’ve decided is the laws of this continent!」</p>
<p>「Hmm? Don’t tell me it really belonged to the dragonkin, okay? It had been destroyed by you guys, so I won’t let you get the right, okay?」</p>
<p>Isario said provocative words in a tone that reversed the opponent’s nerves. He was clearly trying to offend them.</p>
<p>Maybe he’s trying to weaken his decision-making ability to gather information, or maybe he’s planning to let the other party lay the groundwork for a justified defense.</p>
<p>Anyway, they seemed to have decided that they would not be able to negotiate properly.</p>
<p>「Come on, these naughty children go home before they get hurt. If I apologize here, I’ll let the uncle go.」</p>
<p>「Yeah! Don’t treat us as children!」</p>
<p>「Is that what you really think?」</p>
<p>「Kill this old man!」</p>
