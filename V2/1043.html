</div><h1>Chapter 1043</h1><p>As we returned to the inn, we were greeted by somewhat rushed holy knights. In the middle of them was a magician and an appraiser with a weird smile on their faces. </p>
<p>「Oh! You’re right back!」</p>
<p>「I was waiting!」</p>
<p> They called out to Fran out of desperation. But Fran was on guard. After all, they didn’t smile on their faces. Well, they already had a misunderstanding of Silard. Well, they originally only had distrust of Silard.  </p>
<p>「... What?」</p>
<p>「We have decided to accept you as an honorary knight in our country!」</p>
<p>「As an honorary knight, I will honor you as well! Fran tilted her head. I guess she didn’t understand what they were saying.  </p>
<p>「Now, please take a look at our list!」</p>
<p>「All I need next is a letter from my King!」</p>
<p>  The sorcerer and appraiser held out the rolled parchment. Both of them had a slight amount of magic power.  Perhaps even if Fran received the parchment, they would accept that some kind of contract had been made. Just like the way we met the Eiworth Magician’s Guild before. It must be a common tool in this world to trick children.  </p>
<p>『Fran. Don’t take it.』</p>
<p>(I know these guys are trying to do something about it.)</p>
<p> It must be hard for even Fran to see through the plot.  </p>
<p>「We don’t need it.」</p>
<p>「Wha-?  I-It’s an honorary knight, you know? </p>
<p>「It’s the highest honor you would normally not give to a beastman, you know?  I-I take it.」</p>
<p>「I don’t need it.」</p>
<p>  The holy knights blocked Fran’s way as she tried to walk past her. They were trying to force her to be an honorary knight.  But still, they were on the battlefield against the giant antidemons, right? Did they know what Fran was capable of?  No, about half of them were clearly sitting on their backs. Besides, there was a hint of fear in their eyes as they looked through the gap in the helt, so they could not disobey her orders.  Even by this many looks, they didn’t want to be honorary knights, did they?  In other words, they were lower than the shitty ones who were holding out their pulp to us right now. Their title may be flashy, but they were practically just one of the knights that Silard had tamed.  Fran released her aura of intimidation and glared at the holy knights.Fran released her aura of intimidation lightly and glared at the holy knights.  That alone paved the way forward, allowing Fran to follow her lead.  Fran had grown even further after the fierce battle, so there were only a few people she could deal with.  She seemed to be one of the few holy knights here.  Even so, the magician tried to chase Fran badly at his death, but a new figure blocked the way.  </p>
<p>「Wait!  Bring this――」</p>
<p>「What is all this racket?」</p>
<p>「W-You are......」</p>
<p>「Sophie!」</p>
<p>  Sophie, the girl who didn’t pay for her food, was not Sophilia. She saved her many times, and I won’t call her “Devour them all” anymore.  </p>
<p>「You failed because of me or Mea. Now, you have Fran?」</p>
<p>「...... It has nothing to do with you.」</p>
<p>「Fufu.  You call you “Saintess” if you raise her spirits a lot and refuse the recruitment. You know the level of your country, don’t you?」</p>
<p>「You want to make fun of our country!」</p>
<p>「Silard isn’t making fun of you guys.  I’m sure he’s making fun of you guys. But I guess Silard has nothing to do with these idiots.」</p>
<p>「You little!」</p>
<p>「Is that the only thing you can say?」</p>
<p>  Crackless fighting!  The Holy Nation seemed to have angered Sophie and broke the negotiations. The people of Silard were angry, but the anger emanating from Sophie was nothing short of intimidating a puppy.  What can we do to make Sophie angry so much?  What can we do with this?  I thought they might be a reliable reinforcement, but at this rate, they might end up killing each other. But then someone else appeared on the scene.  </p>
<p>「What is the commotion?  This will disturb the inn.」</p>
<p>「You are......」</p>
<p>「You are a knight from another country, aren’t you?  Although you are from a major country, aren’t you being a little rude?」</p>
<p>「That coat of arms! My name is Yagilale, and I’m the third knight leader of the Knights of Segilusel.  I know you.」</p>
<p>「Guh......」</p>
<p> That was Yagilale.  They had successfully returned to Nocta.  </p>
<p>「It’s been a while――but it’s not that long, but I don’t think I’ve seen you for days.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p> The people of the Holy Nation fell silent in front of Yagilale’s gentle expression. They called themselves the Knight Nation, but were they from a rather big country?  </p>
<p>「That’s the same kind of parry as the one we have.  It’s not a good thing, is it?  It’s a kind of evil law that is forbidden in our country. Are they still using such things in the Holy Nation?」</p>
<p>  Yagilale’s tongue flinched, clearly showing that the people of Silard were fleeing. Or rather, they just ran away.  </p>
<p>「I-I don’t know what you’re talking about, huh? Well, it has become a commotion, so let’s have some free time today」</p>
<p>「Ooh, I’ll ask you to talk again when you calm down.  Please spare some time」</p>
<p>「You can wait without leaving」</p>
<p>  These guys...  It seemed that they were begging her, and it was practically an order for them. Fran must have been tired of it.  </p>
<p>「I won’t talk to you anymore」</p>
<p>「Kuh......!」</p>
<p>  The magicians seemed to be about to voice their anger again, as if they were not used to their requests being refused. But in addition to Sophie and Yagilale, they noticed that Mea and Zefmate had also appeared. They ran away quickly.  </p>
<p>「Thank you. Thank you for your help.」</p>
<p>「No, no, you shouldn’t have been able to do anything wrong.  I’m sorry for the trouble you caused us.」</p>
<p>「It was a disaster, wasn’t it?  I was begging you.  They said that I could accept the people of Nocta as slaves under the terms of the recruitment! I wonder who you’re trying to do!」</p>
<p>「Fuhahaha!  You too!  We’ve had similar recruits! Thanks to the Beastmen, we’re willing to accept them as slaves to the Holy Nation!」</p>
<p>  They still didn’t know Mea’s identity.Mea-san!Mea-san! A little bomb!</p>
