</div><h1>Chapter 1133</h1><p>The battlefield was chaotic. The Kranzel Knights, adventurers, and nobles were mixed in, engaged in a battle to kill the undead and red armored knights. So, this was the battlefield, huh? This was the first time I’d seen a large-scale battlefield where people clashed to kill each other. In this world where killing one-sidedly by strong is possible, there were clashes between soldiers. Not many strong people can control the battlefield alone. Kranzel and Raidos, which are major powers and are actively gathering power, are special. Kranzel and Raidos are big powers and actively gather forces, and it’s special.  Besides, it’s not just about crushing their opponents and winning.  War is about taking over their territory. Even if they were to successfully cut off the territory of their enemy country, it would be difficult for a single strong person to control several villages and towns.  That would require a lot of soldiers. And to get rid of the soldiers of the enemy country, we had to prepare many soldiers as well.  There were also the faces of nobles and powerful people. War was also the stage for them to gain achievements.  If only the strong were to be trusted to fight, the nobles would not be able to achieve their goals. As a result, although it was a pity for the soldiers, they were dragged out onto the battlefield as forces that the nobles could use.  Many of the soldiers that the nobles brought with them were mercenaries, but they were pushed by the undead. There were many poison users and regenerating people, so they must have had a hard time.  Among them were the undead specialized in necromancy, the “Scavengers”, created by the Black Skeleton Army. They were said to be continuing to create an army like Jean.  But the worse one was probably the red knight in front of us.  However, he was usually strong without any fancy tricks.  The adventurers were pushed aside, causing a lot of damage. If Forrund hadn’t attracted the enemy’s main forces, they would have already been annihilated.  After all, the magician, who seemed to be the commander of the enemy, was so strong that he could challenge the Forrund of a hundred swords head-on.  We would turn the valiant soldiers into support for the adventurers, and I, Fran, and Urushi will work with Forrund to defeat that commander. Maybe we should start eliminating the undead after that?  While we were discussing with Fran, we found that there was a big change on the battlefield. A white light emanated from Donadrond, the demonkin leading the adventurers.  The light that enveloped their bodies seemed to have the power to heal and protect them. It seemed that the adventurers had suddenly become stronger.  </p>
<p>『This is your chance!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  We started to move.  </p>
<p>「Hey, don’t die!」</p>
<p>「Huh!  What the hell, my priestess!」</p>
<p>「That was what I said before, we’ll take them down, scavengers!」</p>
<p>「Understood!  That fateful person!  I swear to show you!」</p>
<p>「We’ll save the adventurers!」</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Yeah!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>  The warriors rushed into the battlefield in unison and attacked the red knights. Fran led the way and fired an attack at the commander.  Fran’s black lightning succeeded in striking the commander and surprise him.  It didn’t seem to have any damage, but it certainly slowed his movements. Urushi’s shadow magic then entwined the surrounding red knights and blocked their movements.  It was a successful surprise attack! In the meantime, Fran approached Forrund and healed his wounds.  </p>
<p>「Forrund!  Are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Y-yeah」</p>
<p>「My priestess!  Leave the undead to me!」</p>
<p>「Nn. Please.」</p>
<p>  He seemed to be upset to see the Genoside Ghouls that Fran had brought with her, but we didn’t explain it to him later!  </p>
<p>「Forrund!  Bring it all together!」</p>
<p>「Yeah!」</p>
<p>「What the hell!  You!」</p>
<p>  A young man shouted in hatred and unleashed flame magic.  This was the vice-commander of the Red Knights, the “Very Flame Knights”. Yes, he was their vice-commander.  The leader of the unit seemed to have remained at the fort to control the treasure that gave the name of the Red Flame Knight Order.  The effect of the treasure was simple.  It increased the power of the flame magic under his control, increased its flame resistance, and strengthened its physical abilities. In addition, it was possible to greatly enhance the effect by narrowing down the target group.  </p>
<p>『First, I’m going to beat the vice-commander!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「Die!  Die!  Why don’t you die!?」</p>
<p> I used my magic to create a barrier to block flames and canceled it out.  As the vice-commander, aside from her personality, she was a very skilled flame magician.  Even though she had been strengthened, not many people would be able to activate such multiple spells at the same time.  However, I was confident in the simultaneous activation of magic.  Fran, Forrund, and Urushi were closing in the distance while I was offset by the flame magic of the vice-commander. The red knights tried to protect the vice-commander, but the valiant soldiers stood in their way. </p>
<p>「Leave it to me!」</p>
<p>「I won’t let the commander get in their way!」</p>
<p>「Well done.」</p>
<p>  Fran called out to the valiant soldiers, and they nodded happily. They had missed each other for a long time.  </p>
<p>「Grr!」</p>
<p>「Hold it!」</p>
<p>  Can you ignite your body to avoid an attack?  Then how about this! I used the Great Magician skill to slightly hinder your opponent’s flame transformation.  It reminded me that I could control their evil energy with Evil Conquest. Isn’t the Great Magician skill able to interfere with their magic?  The effect took effect right away.  </p>
<p>「Wha-...!  Your body!」</p>
<p>  As I thought, the more powerful the magic was, the more difficult it was to control. It seemed to be difficult to keep using it if I was blocked.  </p>
<p>『Now!』</p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>「Teyaaa!」</p>
<p> As if to respond to my words, Forrund and Fran slashed at it at once.  </p>
<p>「Kuh―― Aghaah...!」</p>
<p>Then the effect took effect immediately. </p>
<p>「Wha-...! Body!」</p>
<p> It was still more difficult to control than powerful magic. It seemed to be difficult to keep using it if it was interrupted. </p>
<p>『Now!』</p>
<p>「Hah!」</p>
<p>「Teyaaa!」</p>
<p> As if to respond to my words, Forrund and Fran slashed at it at once. </p>
<p>「Kuh――Aghaah...!」</p>
<p> There was no way they could avoid the slashes of the two super-masters without magic, and the vice-commander fell down, slashing his head and neck open with blood spattering around.</p>
