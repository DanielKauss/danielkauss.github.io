</div><h1>Chapter 1048</h1><p>The ship was chased by the fleet of the Raidos Kingdom and changed its path to the Kranzel Kingdom.</p>
<p>However, we too were hit by an unexpected situation.</p>
<p>『Oi oi! Barbra is on fire!』</p>
<p>「That’s the water dragonkin!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>We finally arrived at Barbra, where the magic hands of the Kingdom of Raydoss were already at their reach. Fire hands and black smoke rose from the ports and towns, and I could see that there had been considerable damage.</p>
<p>At sea, the ships of the Raidos Kingdom and the Sea Kingdom of Sydran were lined up, and they were bombarded with magic.</p>
<p>Moreover, a familiar chain stretched out into the sea in front of us from a large battle ship. There should be a water dragon connected to that end.</p>
<p>Yes, it was not just a force from the Raidos Kingdom that was attacking Barbra, but a joint fleet with Seedrun, which was equipped with a water dragonkin.</p>
<p>「Sorry! I’ll change my path before I can find you! I can’t go north! I’ll head south again!」</p>
<p>「I have to choose a port of call somewhere else, or...」</p>
<p>Naturally, Brunen and Hilt would not rush into the fleet. There was no way they could beat us, and they had no obligation to do so.</p>
<p>「...Brunnen. My contract has already been severed.」</p>
<p>「...! Are you going to Gordicia next?」</p>
<p>「There are a lot of people I know in Barbra」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>But Fran was troubled by that. There was no way Fran could ignore this.</p>
<p>As for me, I think we should just keep avoiding them, and if we want, they’ll use our contract as shields.</p>
<p>But Brunnen was a man who knew what he was saying.</p>
<p>「......We can’t! We can’t intervene in a conflict between countries without their instructions.」</p>
<p>「I know.」</p>
<p>Brunen shook his head, perhaps understanding Fran’s firm will.</p>
<p>「......Let’s pray for good luck, Fran.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Thanks. See you again」</p>
<p>「Yeah!」</p>
<p>「Fran! Let’s meet again!」</p>
<p>「Fran, take care of me too!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Hilt and Colbert looked similarly stern. Because of their personality, they don’t want to run away here. Especially for Colbert, who is one of their strongholds.</p>
<p>But there was a contract with Brunen, and they couldn’t abandon this ship. In the end, all they could do was cheer Fran on.</p>
<p>「Young miss! Do your best!」</p>
<p>「Uni, it was delicious!」</p>
<p>「Another one!」</p>
<p>Fran nodded back in response to the crew’s cheers and climbed on Urushi.</p>
<p>「Urushi, at full speed. But not to be found」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Race: Ragnarok Wolf; Demon Wolf; Magic Beast</p>
<p>Urushi ran rather slowly so that he could not release his spell, and over a period of about 100 minutes, he arrived at the sky above Barbra.</p>
<p>Looking down, the allied fleet of Raidos and Seedrun continued to be bombarded. People were rushing to the gate opposite the port to evacuate out of town.</p>
<p>The castle, which should have been a haven, had been left in tatters by the bombardment. holes had drilled in various parts of the castle, and the spire had collapsed. Fires were beginning to go around, and in a few hours it would be completely useless.</p>
<p>Currently, the Sanatorium was packed with a different kind of nobleman than the former feudal lord, the Cristons. Will they be safe? If the chain of command was disrupted, the evacuation would be affected.</p>
<p>The adventurers were also fleeing. Aside from land, it would be difficult to counterattack from the sea.</p>
<p>But there were dozens of people who had frozen in place. They were the soldiers’ office on the side of the main street. I didn’t know who they were, but they were probably planning to buy citizens time to escape when the enemy landed.</p>
<p>However, the bombardment had landed several times, and it looked like the buildings would eventually collapse.</p>
<p>「I’ll make her stop attacking.」</p>
<p>『Well, that’s the quickest way』</p>
<p>「What should we do?」</p>
<p>『Yeah...』</p>
<p>It would take time to sink all of the more than a hundred ships. If that were the case, we would have to disrupt the chain of command targeting the flagship.</p>
<p>We only targeted one opponent.</p>
<p>『Let’s attack the water dragonkin with all our might』</p>
<p>「Okay!」</p>
<p>Now that they hadn’t been found yet, we could unleash the best blows we could withstood to its limit. That would sunk the water dragonkin and reduce the number of confused enemies.</p>
<p>That was probably the easiest way to go. The only problem was whether or not we could sink a water dragonkin with a single blow.</p>
<p>What it called the strongest battle ship yet was imbued with magical tools to strengthen water dragons. We were unable to break through its defenses in the past.</p>
<p>Moreover, the amount of magic power it contained was on a different level than the water dragonkin we had seen before. Considering that it was a new ship, it probably had increased defense power.</p>
<p>「Still, we have to do it.」</p>
<p>『Yeah.』</p>
<p>Right now, we just have to trust our power and give it everything we have. Just as the other side has been strengthened, we have also grown.</p>
<p>「I’m sure we can do it.」</p>
<p>『Yeah!』</p>
<p>「Urushi, cover!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>First, Urushi activated his magic. Countless jet-black spears were created and poured down on the water dragonkin. If it were a normal ship, it would have been full of holes.</p>
<p>However, all of the black spears were blocked by a thin layer of light. They looked like normal wards instead of water dragons’ water magic. They seemed to have even more defense than the older types.</p>
<p>However, we were expecting to be able to prevent Urushi’s first blow. In fact, we were aiming to scatter our defenses by daring to prevent a wide range of attacks.</p>
<p>Amidst the dome-shaped barrier covering the water dragonkin, Fran and I launched our follow up attack.</p>
<p>「Haaa! Kanna Kamui!」</p>
<p>『Eat this! More than one Kanna Kamui!』</p>
<p>She chose magic instead of slashing because she chose the one that had a greater effect after use. The combination of the Heaven Judgement and the Black Lightning God’s Claw definitely had tremendous offensive power.</p>
<p>However, the range of their attack was rather narrow. They could only target one of them, a water dragonkin or a water dragon.</p>
<p>Compared to that, thunder magic could cover a wider area and could even affect the other ships through the sea. When there were many enemies, it was more convenient for Inazun to Zelos Reed instead of Mezzo.</p>
<p>A bunch of white lightning released from the sky then intertwined in midair and rained down on the water dragonkin. It was not just fired at the same time, but it was calculated to be more powerful.</p>
<p>It was possible because of the information security skills and the great magician that we obtained in Gordicia. One time I got more than 10,000 magic power, but it was no problem.</p>
<p>That was the only shot that was worth it.</p>
<p>The thunderbolt raged like an angry Heavenly Dragon and emitted a flash of light at the water dragonkin’s barrier. I could see the barrier beginning to crumble.</p>
<p>Just a little more!</p>
<p>As we continued to maintain our release, we poured more magic power into it.</p>
<p>「Ikea!」</p>
<p>『Orraa!』</p>
