</div><h1>Chapter 941</h1><p>On the way to Brutori, nothing really happened. Even if a few antidemons appeared, the adventurers had no choice but to take them down as if they were racing with the holy knights of Silard and the black infantrymen of Hagane. Moreover, the speed of their march was extraordinary. The holy knights and black foot soldiers were both quite skilled, had enough strength to keep running for a long time, and were equipped with healing potions. Adventurers were following behind these two great powers without delay. Adventurers were following these two great powers without a delay.  Isario was sent flying by himself, and the adventurers were able to run faster than the holy knights thanks to Fran’s title of “March of the Valkyrie”.  Thanks to this, we were able to reach Brutori in about half of our time. Maybe it didn’t even take us four hours.  The holy knights were looking at us with astonishment on their faces.  Apparently, the people of the two great powers estimated the marching speed of adventurers much slower than before. For the holy knights and black foot soldiers, it must have been a complicated and unreliable force of lower rank. They had been neglecting adventurers because they had to adjust themselves to those who did not have the will to fight.  But it was themselves who became a hindrance when they opened their lids. It was only natural that there would be subtle changes in the way they looked at adventurers.  Well, that doesn’t mean they would be friendly.  </p>
<p>「Tsk!  You weaklings!」</p>
<p>  to </p>
<p>「Fu-fun.  Well, it looks like you can use it. At best, it won’t get in their way」</p>
<p>.  The group then entered the town of Brutori and unloaded supplies in the large square in front of the gate. They have also started sending scout soldiers to the antidemons, and were steadily making preparations. And Fran and the commander were currently meeting with the guildmaster of Brutori.  </p>
<p>「O-okay, welcome you!  I-I welcome you!」</p>
<p>  The guildmaster of Brutori was very low-ranking. Or rather, he was just about to sit down on his knees?  In the first place, the Adventurers Guild of Brutori was small in scale and was treated like a branch of the guild of Nocta. It was probably because many adventurers would flow to Nocta in the vicinity.  A large guild was not necessary because there were too many adventurers. The meeting began in a small conference room with a small guild, but it was completely at the pace of the two major powers. The only thing they wanted to say was that they would tell their demands from the higher-ups and then the guildmaster would accept them. They would also use their divine swords, so they had little idea of cooperating with other countries or organizations. It was two great powers that showed no signs of rivalry, so I wondered who would be the first to go to the battlefield, but that didn’t happen.  Apparently, there have been agreements between the two countries for a long time, and they have changed the country where deployment is prioritized every time.  This time, it was their priority to Silard.  Without any heated exchange of information, Silard was naturally the first to fight. He didn’t talk to Fran or Isario.  As Fran tilted her head, the guildmaster quietly told us about a lot of things. I guess he was afraid that Fran would say unnecessary things and buy the discord between the two great powers.  It seems like the guildmaster here didn’t care what Fran sent was a subtle selection of people.  He knew what she was capable of, so he didn’t look down on her.  However, as a child, the rumors were radical. He didn’t seem to be worried that she might cause a conflict with the two major powers.  Fran just twitched and moved, staring at her with an irritated look on her face.  As for Isario, he’s been drinking alcohol for a long time now.  I heard that he won’t work if he doesn’t have to work. And yet, the reason we came to this city was to reassure the people of this town by the appearance of Isario, a celebrity.  He was a drunk man, but he seemed to understand the subtleties of that.  In the end, Silard would be the first to deploy, followed by Hagane if something came up. Fran may want to deploy, but it’s too dangerous to go against the two great powers, so we should watch over them.  Fran knew that too, so she nodded her head reluctantly.  After the meeting, we somehow headed for the bar with Isario. The guildmaster was very strict in giving instructions to the adventurers, so we decided to leave everything to him.  He probably wanted to make a little presence for himself, and was worried about leaving it to Fran. He said that they would split up the adventurers into groups and take turns defending the gate. Fran only needed to ask them a breakdown of the turns and follow that rule as she headed for the gatekeeper.  Isario got a thumbs-up for the wine, Fran asked for a lot of food, and she sat down in the corner of the bar. Maybe it was because both of them were hiding their presence, but no one seemed to want to pick a fight.  Both Fran and Isario continued to eat in silence.  They didn’t seem to get along, but even if they kept quiet, it didn’t feel awkward. Maybe it was because they were high-ranked adventurers, or maybe it was because they were too different in ages and personality, and there was no point in clashing with each other.  They were surprisingly not in complete sync. When they were able to reduce the number of their dishes to a certain extent, Isario finally opened his mouth.  </p>
<p>「Even so, Miss Hilt is not trusted」</p>
<p>「Master said the right person was the right person. I’ll let you do it if you want to」</p>
<p>「Kuhaha, that’s Master-san for you.  That’s right. You can do what you want to do, no matter what kind of work you want to do」</p>
<p>「But I’ll leave when it’s a fight」</p>
<p>「... Miss Hilt... </p>
<p>「Like to fight」</p>
<p>「You won’t be able to get stronger unless you fight」</p>
<p>「You’ve got a straight eye, uncle. Uncle, I’m envious when I see those eyes.」</p>
<p>  Isario muttered and gulped down a drink.</p>
<p>「Kuhaha, that’s Master-san for you. He’s right. You can do whatever you want to do, no matter what the job is.」</p>
<p>「But I’ll leave when it’s a fight.」</p>
<p>「Miss Hilt, are you that kind of person?」</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>「Like to fight.」</p>
<p>「You won’t be able to get stronger unless you fight.」</p>
<p>「You’ve got a straight eye. Uncle, I’m envious when I see those eyes.」</p>
<p> Isario muttered and gulped down a drink. His tone was as carefree as ever, but I could hear his words seriously.</p>
