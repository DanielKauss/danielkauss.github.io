</div><h1>Chapter 992</h1><p>「Hmm? Come to think of it, Georg and the others brought Tilanaria and a girl with them, didn’t they? If that’s the case, then yes, there are!」</p>
<p>「...!」</p>
<p> Frederick’s murderous intent was boosted by Trismegistus’ words. The same went for Fran. But how did they get so casually exposed? If we were in a relationship with the Dragon King, not only Frederick but also Isario might turn against him... I don’t think they were stupid enough to understand the danger... Or did they just be confident in their own strength and think they could turn him against us? Or maybe he’s so confident in his strength that he can turn against us? As all of us were suspicious, Frederick asked in a suppressed voice. </p>
<p>「Are you working with the Dragon King?」</p>
<p> The current Frederick, who was mentally destabilized due to his increased power as an evil dragonkin, would jump right away with any answer he got.  Trismegistus was not even shaken slightly by Frederick’s bomb-like presence. He simply opened his mouth, just like he had done in the past.  </p>
<p>「Joining forces?  That’s not happening.」</p>
<p>「Really? Are they bad guys?」</p>
<p>「I, the great sinner, am not going to care about anything like that.  In the first place, I am not interested in the outside world.  The bad guys and good guys, the saintess and sinners are just as strangers to me. There is no point in doing anything more than that.」</p>
<p>「They may be doing bad in this castle.」</p>
<p>「Restriction on access to my castle is set by outsiders on their own.  I will not refuse what comes and will not chase anyone who leaves.  You guys, do whatever you want. No matter what you do, I will not blame you.  It may be evil, or it may be good.」</p>
<p>  I made Fran question him and used the Principle of Falsehood, but there was not a slightest lie in Trismegistus’ words. It seemed that for this man, he really didn’t care about other people.  No matter what he did in the castle, he was not interested in it as long as it didn’t interfere with his own. I see, I think I’ve seen a glimpse of its monster-like nature.  </p>
<p>「However, I am happy to see more and more strong people on this continent. Therefore, the Red lotus blade, that one is different from the other.」</p>
<p>  Isario seemed to be the reason why this man, who said he was not interested in others, came all the way here to greet the second unit.  He seemed to be somewhat interested in the Abyss Eater, the mission he was asked to fulfill. </p>
<p>「Also... Is there a possibility that her priestess’s younger brother and this girl will eventually help in their demise? I’ll do my best」</p>
<p>  In terms of adventurer strength, they would only care about him if he was on par with an A-ranked adventurer. I’m not sure if it’s a good thing to get interested in this man though. In our case, we’re here to hear about an intelligence weapon, so it would be a plus if they could remember our faces.  </p>
<p>『Fran.  It’s impossible right now. It’s not something we can do here』</p>
<p>「Nn...  I have some business with you. I want to hear from you when things calm down.」</p>
<p>「Oh?  I don’t mind.  That’s what it’s all about.」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「Now that you mention it, your goal was this guy. Well, we’re going to chase after the Dragon King right now, okay?」</p>
<p>「I know.」</p>
<p> Right now, priority is on Velmeria and the Dragon King.  Fran knows that. </p>
<p>「Trismegistus-san, are the Dragon Kings still in the castle?」</p>
<p>「It looks like they took their priestesses and went down to the basement.」</p>
<p>「Whoa...... You mean the underground room?」</p>
<p>「That’s crazy!  You took Velmeria and Frederick there? What is Georg going to do!?」</p>
<p>  I’ve heard there’s a nucleus of the Abyss Eater in the basement of the castle. In other words, the Dragon King and Frederick went there.  Could it be that someone who could manipulate the antidemons made contact with the Abyss Eater’s nucleus? I had a bad feeling about it though.  </p>
<p>「It’s time for us to exterminate them. If you come with us, you can do whatever you want」</p>
<p>「I’ll be spoiled by your words」</p>
<p>  But they couldn’t just chase us instantly. The nuclear space seemed to be a place where powerful antidemons spring up, and not a place where all the troops here can rush in. Trismegistus was forced to continue to whittle down the Abyss Eater due to Divine Punishment.  They defeat the high-ranking antidemons that are produced in the underground room, dying on the verge of death, and attack the Abyss Eater’s nuclear power until it runs out of magic. That was the content of his Divine Punishment.  </p>
<p>「Fran, I’ll go with Frederick」</p>
<p>「Understood」</p>
<p>  Isario must be considering the Divine Sword Release. If we head to the small basement with a large army, we will surely get caught up in it. The adventurers seemed to understand that as well and nodded in frustration.  We stepped foot into the castle, guided by Trismegistus, who was walking leisurely.  He walked straight through the castle without looking back at us.  The various furniture was lined up and the walls were decorated with paintings. All of them seemed to be in perfect condition. Isario gave us a short explanation, as if he had sensed Fran’s doubts.  </p>
<p>「I heard that this castle is maintained by the power of the Gods」</p>
<p>「Is the Gods cleaning it?」</p>
<p>「Ha-ha-ha.  It seems that time has been fixed since the day the Divine Punishment was given. Even if it is destroyed, it can’t be regenerated, and furniture can’t cross the barrier on the hill.」</p>
<p>「Why?」</p>
<p>「That’s just the Gods thinking.  However, there was a huge amount of goods stored in this castle. But the dragonkin were apparently in a lot of trouble because they couldn’t bring it with them.」</p>
<p> So they made it impossible for them to take the treasury not only from Trismegistus but also from the dragonkin under his command?  There were precious treasures that could not be obtained and beautiful castles that remained clean and untouched for eternity. It seemed to be a symbol of great sin and a symbol of greed.  </p>
<p>「Here I come」</p>
<p>  At Trismegistus’ invitation, we arrived at the throne room.  The room was large enough for hundreds of people, but Fran and the others were the only ones there. The room was so spacious that the coldness of being uninhabited could be felt even stronger.  Trismegistus approached the throne. But instead of sitting there, he seemed to have come to take a sword on a pedestal.  It was a white silver Falcion, with graceful curves. It was a magic sword that could be recognized as a work of art with both military and beauty.  The sword, perhaps――.  Trismegistus grabbed the Falcion and muttered.  </p>
<p>「Today is also the time for our atonement.</p>
<p>「Today is also the time for our atonement.</p>
<p>「Today is also the time for our atonement. Let’s go, Juanaverta.」</p>
