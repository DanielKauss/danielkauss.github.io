</div><h1>Chapter 923</h1><p>The surrounding antidemons had been destroyed by the steel wolves, and the dew was completely clear. It wasn’t Fran who missed this chance. </p>
<p>「Keep going! Defeat the antidemons boss!」</p>
<p>『You’re right! But don’t let your guard down!』</p>
<p>「Don’t worry!」</p>
<p> Fran shouted, increasing her speed even more. Then, she ran off in the direction of what gave off a stronger presence. </p>
<p>「Taaaah!」</p>
<p> Fran and I fired a lightning bolt to defeat the antidemons in their path, and before the antidemons filled the free space, Fran rushed over and shook me again. Fran and I unleashed lightning that defeated the antidemons in their path, and before the antidemons filled their free space, Fran rushed in and swung me again.  While cleaning up the annoying antidemons, Fran approached the commander of the antidemons at once. She broke through the barrier of tens of thousands of antidemons in just a few seconds.  Divine Beasting, on the other hand, was terrifying.  But it would not be an exaggeration to say that it was a true battle from this point on. </p>
<p>「Grrorororooorgh!」</p>
<p>「Gugyuaaah!」</p>
<p>「Hmm.  They looked pretty strong!」</p>
<p>『But this number is......!』</p>
<p>  There was clearly a special antidemon, in a different atmosphere, power, and appearance than the other antidemons. But not just one.  To our surprise, five special antidemons were waiting for Fran.  Who was the commander of this herd?  Or was they all of them?  Or maybe even stronger? But these were clearly special.  Twisted Horn at Castel was the strongest antidemon we had fought so far. I didn’t think he was that strong, but he was much stronger than the red dragon-type antidemons, which were second only to the strongest.  </p>
<p>「...... Just beat them all up.」</p>
<p> Fran muttered and glared at the antidemons, who seemed to be the commanders with belligerent eyes.  </p>
<p>『Alright!  We can do it now!  As long as we put all our strength into it!』</p>
<p>「I don’t know how long we’ll be able to become a Divine Beast. But before we can do it, we’ll do what we can!」</p>
<p>『Ou!  I’ll use the Steel Wolf to split up.  I’ll take them down one by one!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  It’s not an easy fight, but I’m sure we could fight one against five now. But before we could challenge ourselves, a new intruder appeared in this place. </p>
<p>「I’ll fight too!」</p>
<p>「I’ll do it too!」</p>
<p>「Grrrrr!」</p>
<p>「Hahaha!  Mix in!」</p>
<p>  Velmeria’s entire body except for her face turned into a dragon.  Zefmate looked like a leopard, rising up blue magic power.  Urushi in black darkness.  Mea in white flames. They were so reliable that their strength enhancements were on par with Fran’s. Velmeria, with her water-colored scales all over her body, was in a Divine Dragon Form state, and she was probably just regaining the power from the rampage in the Royal Capital.  Zefmate’s head had completely transformed into a pant.  In addition, his legs were as close to that of a beast as possible, and his body was covered with Divine Attributes. Obviously, he was not in a normal state of awakening.  My appraisal said that he was in a Divine Beast Form. Perhaps this was the end of the list of beastmen other than the Ten Primordial Races that would reach him.  The agility of the beastman was over 1,500, and he had activated the skill “Blue Pant”.  It was a skill named after his race, so it couldn’t be weak. There’s no way it’s weak.  It seems that his whole body can now be covered with power like a leopard.  I guess that means that his tricky movements and attack power have been refined.  Urushi was in a Potential Release state.  Potential Release was dangerous, but now, thanks to Sophie’s song, he was in a state of self-healing. Apparently, the burden was much lighter than the Potential Release we used.  There seemed to be almost no automatically losing his life force.  With this, self-destruction would be quite a long time coming. Her status hadn’t increased much except for agility.  However, she had an Innate Skill called “Twilight”. Apparently, it was a forced debuffing ability that greatly weakened the opponent she had touched.  And Mea was probably the one who had achieved the most terrifying evolution.  Although she was in a state of White Beast, her stats were over a thousand across the board, and </p>
<p>『 Divine Flame』</p>
<p> had been added to her skill. The white flames all over her body were emitting Divine Attributes, and her auto counter was not enough to be called vicious.  When she touched it for just a moment, the white Divine Flame spread and spread to her entire body in no time. And she would never disappear until the opponent disappeared.  </p>
<p>「Mea is amazing!」</p>
<p>「Fuhahaha!  Of course!  But that is not the only power I have obtained!」</p>
<p> With a high laugh, Mea pulled out the sword on her back.  She held her beloved sword aloft.  It was the divine sword inhabited by the red dragon Lind.  </p>
<p>「Could it be!」</p>
<p>「Correct! With the enhancement of both me and Lind, the gate to a new power has been opened!」</p>
<p>  Mea swung her divine sword horizontally and shouted.  </p>
<p>「You dragon king of dragons, the red bloodthirsty dragons! Reveal his appearance in front of me!」</p>
<p> Right now, the second divine sword was about to materialize.  </p>
<p>「Rindwilm, the Divine Sword Release!」</p>
<p>  The violent dragon sword, Lindwilm, responded to Mea’s shout. An enormous amount of magic power began to swirl around the divine sword.  The engravings of the red dragon on its blade provide a fierce light. And that light enveloped the entire sword, creating a powerful flash of light.  </p>
<p>「Ggyaah!」</p>
<p> A little, Mea herself, who was closest to us, was staring right now!  </p>
<p>「Eyes! My eyes!」</p>
<p>『Musu*ka!』</p>
<p>「Mu*ka?」</p>
<p>『Sorry, it’s nothing. I felt like I had to get a little carried away』</p>
<p>  But still, this was the first time she used the Divine Sword Release to kill herself!Anyways, this is the first time I’ve ever used the Divine Sword Release before, so I’m gonna let myself get caught up in it!</p>
