</div><h1>Chapter 1009</h1><p>Trismegistus lightly held up the sword he possessed and said without a word. </p>
<p>「Juanaverta said that you still have value for use. So, it would be a problem if you die here.」</p>
<p> I knew it, that sword was really an intelligence weapon! That’s why he listened to Fran’s words in a tremendous way. He must have a deep grudge against the Dragon King for defeating his ancestors. He spoke proudly as he said that he could save their lives and that it was worth using. That must be a tremendous humiliation for Merritte, his revenge. That must be a tremendous humiliation for Merutte, his revenge.  </p>
<p>「I’ll kill you too!」</p>
<p>「I see. Just do whatever you want.」</p>
<p> I wonder what kind of relationship these two really are.  Trismegistus, who had severed his conversation with Meritte, turned away from her as if saying that the conversation was no longer over. Meritte was staring at her with glaring eyes, but she didn’t attack her. He knew that he couldn’t kill him, and that he would be defeated by Fran if Trismegistus came back to life here.  His position was that the Dragon King, who hated him and couldn’t help but die if he didn’t protect him. The whiteness of their lips as they bit into Fran’s mouth told me just how much emotion they were holding back.  Fran then calmly opened her mouth in front of the One Who Overcame all of a sudden. </p>
<p>「Are you friends with Merritte?」</p>
<p>「No, not.  It’s just that her talent is rare.  Therefore, it’s a shame to kill her.」</p>
<p>「She’s a genius for using a failed divine sword.  Even though she was no longer using the official numbering, she was originally created as a divine sword.  Not just anyone could handle it.  She wielded two of them at the same time. They worked very well with Zechs’ failed divine sword.」</p>
<p>  I guess those two were made by the divine blacksmith, Zechs. Judging from Trismegistus’ words, the Near-Divine Sword, which was not officially recognized as a Divine Sword, was probably called the Discarded Divine Sword at once.  </p>
<p>「The fallen Heavenly Sword, Falldown.  It gives you the power to control evil energy instead of turning you into an evil person. The Evil Evil Eater, which allows you to control antidemons instead of turning your own body into one, is both treated at the same time and remains sane」</p>
<p> I see, now I somehow understood the intertwining of Meritte’s control abilities.  A sword that manipulates evil energy and a sword that manipulates antidemons.  In addition, Wisteria’s bloodline leads the evil god. By bringing all of them together, it should be possible to control antidemons and evil dragonkin.  Is the power to create antidemons the power of two failed divine swords? Judging from what I saw from the fact that they were stuck in the Abyss Eater’s nucleus, it seems they can give orders to the nucleus with Ebiru Eater’s abilities?  </p>
<p>「If I’m going to retreat here, I won’t pursue you, will I?」</p>
<p>「Meltritte... What are you planning to do?」</p>
<p>「I don’t feel the need to answer you」</p>
<p>「Kuh...!」</p>
<p>  Trismegistus didn’t allow him to do so. </p>
<p>「Oh?  You want to react?」</p>
<p>  He wielded the Juanaverta in his hand, while being impressed. His slash was precise and sharp, but he didn’t seem to have any hostility towards us as usual.  This was the first time I had seen an opponent whose atmosphere and behavior were not intertwined like this. Moreover, his swordsmanship was more than equal to Fran’s.  </p>
<p>(He’s strong!)</p>
<p>『He’s definitely at the level of Swordking Mastery!』</p>
<p>  He’s been wielding his sword on the continent of Gordicia for many years. In fact, it might have been unnatural without being extremely skilled.  Fran gets fired up again and begins to counterattack.  </p>
<p>「Taaah!」</p>
<p>「I see.  Will we use Swordking Mastery?  I can see that Juanaverta is taking a danger from that sword.  Hmm?  Does that mean it’s just useful? I see.」</p>
<p>  Trismegistus was suddenly mumbling to himself.  That must be telepathy. Fran and I may look that way to the outsiders. </p>
<p>「This is the first time I’ve seen an intelligence weapon other than Juanaverta」</p>
<p>「! How do you know?」</p>
<p>「Juanaverta is a very skilled at information analysis.  It’s easy to intercept someone’s telepathy.  I’d love to analyze it, but if it’s not available, my second-in-command will tell me to destroy it. So, I’m gonna destroy it」</p>
<p>  So, she had stolen my telepathy and found out what I was talking about! I disguised myself with Appraisal Jammer and Concealment, but if they found out that I was talking, I could guess. And it seems that Juanaverta saw me as a danger.  </p>
<p>「You’re going to destroy Master...?」</p>
<p>「If you give it to me now, I won’t be able to hurt you, you know?」</p>
<p>「Don’t be ridiculous...!」</p>
<p>  Fran was so angry at Trismegistus for declaring that she was going to destroy me. It was so devastating that even I could feel chills. It was not that he was directly angered, but Isario was trembling with a pure blue face made of blood, and he even trembled.  If a person who didn’t know anything looked at Fran now, he would be crazy no matter what I thought. I couldn’t feel any hint of rationality from Fran now.But it seemed that it was only a matter of time before they realized that Fran was crazy.  But it seemed that it was only a matter of time before they realized that Fran was crazy.  Fran roared wildly like a beast and struck me with her killing intent.</p>
<p>「Nice move.」</p>
