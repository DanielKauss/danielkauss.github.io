</div><h1>Chapter 1108</h1><p>A pillar of light stood out from the eastern side of Alessa.</p>
<p>「Alessa!」</p>
<p>『It’s right next to the main building!』</p>
<p>A tremendous amount of magic power was released, causing great damage to the surrounding area.</p>
<p>(I can hear her voice.)</p>
<p>『Answer?』</p>
<p>(Shout......)</p>
<p>I can’t hear any voices, right? But Fran seems to have a good hearing. Could it be the voice of a spirit?</p>
<p>As I watched over her, the pillar of light gradually changed its shape. Meanwhile, a storm seemed to have blew around the area, but we couldn’t do anything about it.</p>
<p>Then, three minutes later.</p>
<p>「I’ve taken the form of a woman」</p>
<p>『I’ve heard that only high-ranking spirits can become a human being, but...』</p>
<p>It was a huge, humanoid being. And it was a storm that was raging through it. We could tell by now that it was here.</p>
<p>(Klimt’s, great spirit?)</p>
<p>『There’s no doubt. It’s the Great Spirit of Wind. But why in a town like this?』</p>
<p>Even if Klimt and the others were attacked, they would not be countered by the Great Spirit. If used, this would definitely get the surrounding area caught up in the “disastrous” scene. Even now, nearly half of the wide Noble Town was probably still affected.</p>
<p>Something unexpected happened, forcing the Great Spirit to be released.</p>
<p>(What do we do?)</p>
<p>『What’s wrong...?』</p>
<p>The Great Spirit remained in its place. There was no sign of movement. However, the wind was raging wildly just by being there, and the damage to the surrounding area was increasing.</p>
<p>I could feel the presence of Klimt and the others. They seemed to still stay at the feet of the Great Spirit. I wonder if they couldn’t move or move. In the first place, how far the Great Spirit was under Klimt’s control?</p>
<p>(Let’s go.)</p>
<p>『Yeah. I guess Klimut is the only one who can do something about it...』</p>
<p>I don’t think we can manage to fight him any more, and if he gets a little violent, Alessa will disappear. We have to hold him back peacefully.</p>
<p>「Urushi, wait here.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>Leaving the captives to Urushi, we decided to head for the main building. I didn’t know how effective it would be on the spirits, but we slowly moved along the main street, concealing our presence.</p>
<p>『You haven’t noticed us yet...』</p>
<p>(Nn......)</p>
<p>The spirit’s gaze didn’t turn toward us. But I didn’t know what the spirit’s vision was. I didn’t really know if it was aware of our existence or not.</p>
<p>They approached us cautiously, just in case they would suddenly attack us.</p>
<p>And as a result, I guess that was a good thing.</p>
<p>『Fran!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>The bullets of wind wentuge into the place where Fran had jumped as quickly as she could. It was still quite a distance away, but are we going to be attacked now?!</p>
<p>I knew it was powerful, but to think it was a failed divine sword!</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>After releasing her stealth, Fran devoted all her strength to run. Countless bullets of wind attacked us, but Fran continued to run across the main street, scratching everything she knew.</p>
<p>They didn’t seem to be looking at us as usual, but their aim was quite accurate. Not only bullets but even invisible slashes began to join in.</p>
<p>He would have preferred to escape to an alleyway, but a poor run would cause damage to the civilians. Fortunately, thanks to his precise aim, only the people around Fran’s main street were attacked.</p>
<p>Fran knew this too, and continued to dodge her attacks with only minimal movement, moderate movement, and barriers.</p>
<p>『Just a little more!』</p>
<p>「Nn...」</p>
<p>『What’s wrong, Fran?』</p>
<p>「Silence, shut up.」</p>
<p>『Shout of the spirit, huh?』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>I couldn’t hear it as usual, but Fran seemed to be able to hear it to the extent that she frowned. I should have Spirit Detection now. I could sense a faint presence, but it was probably because of the powerful Great Spirit. Perhaps, a little strong adventurer would feel something similar to me.</p>
<p>The place where the feudal lord’s office stood, which we could see from a distance, was in terrible devastation.</p>
<p>It was completely destroyed, most of it had been blown away by the winds of the spirits. Well, it was not only the feudal lord’s building, but also the noble’s mansions in the area.</p>
<p>Is the only thing that was good about it was that there didn’t seem to be much damage to the civilians?</p>
<p>There was a hint of nobles running away, but they seemed to be under the attack of spirits. Their life force erased in an instant.</p>
<p>(Master! Over there!)</p>
<p>『Klimt and the others!』</p>
<p>Klimt and the others were now on the site of the former feudal lord’s office.</p>
<p>Both Urushi, the knight captain, and Zenos, the feudal lord, were safe. However, Klimut was the only one who had dyed his robe with bright red blood and collapsed on the ground.</p>
<p>The two on the left and right sides were caring for Klimut, but they seemed to be able to do nothing more than give him first aid. Was the reason they didn’t run away was because of the serious wounds that made it impossible for Klimut to move?</p>
<p>A little while later, at the site of the former feudal lord’s building, a particularly powerful attack was fired. The two huge tornadoes that suddenly occurred approached from the left and right as if they were trying to crush Fran.</p>
<p>『Fran, keep going! I’ll block it!』</p>
<p>「Okay!」</p>
<p>I couldn’t sense anything from just the barrier. That’s why I created two tornadoes with my wind magic and fired them forward. The tornadoes created by the Great Spirit collided with the ones I released.</p>
<p>Our tornado was much smaller, but it didn’t have to be completely canceled out.</p>
<p>『All right! It just got a little weaker! Ikea!』</p>
<p>「Taaah!」</p>
<p>Even if it weakened, it was a tornado. The barrier I had put up was greatly reduced. However, with Fran’s leg strength, she was able to break through the pillar of the storm in an instant and escape.</p>
<p>We were already at our destination.</p>
<p>「Klimut! There he is!」</p>
<p>『Oi! This is bad! You’re seriously on the verge of death!』</p>
