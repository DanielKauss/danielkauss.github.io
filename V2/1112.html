</div><h1>Chapter 1112</h1><p>While evading and defending, she jumped around the great spirit to look for the nucleus. But as soon as Marl, who was supposed to be sleeping inside Fran, woke up and began to radiate her power. </p>
<p>『Fran, how is it?』</p>
<p>(Mal is guiding her!)</p>
<p> Fran stared at the upper half of the great spirit’s body. With Marl’s assist, she seemed to be able to sense the presence of the spirit more than ever. At this rate, we might be able to find the nucleus of the great spirit in no time. At this rate, it may be possible to find the nucleus of the great spirit soon.  However, it seemed that Mar’s magic power had been detected from the great spirit as well.  Next step was to make sure that we eliminated dangerous opponents. </p>
<p>「Gwah!」</p>
<p>『Fran!』</p>
<p>「...!」</p>
<p>  When Fran let out a sore scream, the blood was instantly lost and discolored in white.  She was holding her throat in her hand, but she didn’t hear a voice. It was as if she was choking――  </p>
<p>『I see!』</p>
<p>  I quickly used my Wind Magic and sent the wind from Fran’s mouth. At the same time, Fran was coughing hard and regaining her voice.  </p>
<p>「Geho!  Gwooorgh! Hah...」</p>
<p>  I don’t know the composition of the air in this world, and I don’t even know if the living being was sucking oxygen.  However, there was no doubt that there was some kind of substance that was necessary for her to breathe. The Great Spirit then manipulated it to make Fran suffocated.  Fran was used to the pain and shock, but she had never experienced suffocation before. As expected, her movements had stopped. Naturally, her number of interceptions were dwindling, and the winds of the Great Spirit’s control rushed in at once.  </p>
<p>『Uwooorgh!』</p>
<p>  I activated a large amount of magic at once and scattered it around the area.  It was terrible and chills.  The use of magic had exceeded its limit.  Even so, it hadn’t reached its limit. But still, it hadn’t reached the point where Fran’s hole could be filled.  Countless wounds had pierced Fran’s body and blood was flying around.  Think about it!  What should we do!  Run with teleportation?  No!  If I distance myself from here, I don’t think I’ll be able to get closer anymore!  But what if I can’t block it and take some serious damage?  If I somehow manage to overcome this attack, I can rebuild myself! But that was the only way―――  Boom.  For a moment, something wriggled inside me.  It was as if it was revealing its existence. And at the same time, the Evil God Fragment was erupting.  appealing that it could use its power? That’s how much I remembered the scene I had seen in the lake in the Belios Kingdom.  It was the scene where Sierra used the evil energy of his magic sword, Zelos Reed, to cancel out Zelyse’s skill. With the help of the Evil God Fragment, I could do the same thing, wouldn’t I?  In the midst of the super-fast flowing thoughts, I immediately moved into action. I don’t have time to get lost.  Lend me your strength, and the Evil God!  Although there was no response from the Evil God Fragment, I felt that my resistance to drawing out the Evil Spirit was decreasing.  I felt as if I was drawing out the Evil Spirit from the Evil God Fragment―― Or rather, it was even sending an Evil Spirit from the other side. Sierra used the evil energy as a chain and wrapped it around his opponent.  However, I had to intercept the attacks that rained down from all around me.  Then, I’d use a wall instead of a chain. </p>
<p>『Uooooh!』</p>
<p>  Without cutting off the barrier that I was just maintaining and the magic of intercepting, I would create a new evil barrier! I know that I’m going to exceed my limit, but this is where the match ends! Just as I had intended, the evil wall perfectly canceled out the wind attack, and the surroundings calmed down at once.  However, I was a little surprised.  I could even call it a beating.  The burden was less than I had imagined when creating the evil barrier. It was as if something was sharing the burden.  It somehow felt like the Evil God Fragment was lending me its power, but what else could I do――?  </p>
<p>(Master?)</p>
<p>『Oops! </p>
<p>(Nn.  Suddenly, I can’t breathe)</p>
<p>  I knew it.  Right now I was using wind magic to circulate the air, but this was the Great Spirit of Wind.  It was one of the best class of opponents in the world when it comes to controlling wind. I don’t even know if this will keep me from suffocating attacks.  </p>
<p>(This wall of evil energy. Master?)</p>
<p>『Yeah.  However, I’m afraid of losing my magic power』</p>
<p>  I was activating Magic Absorption and Magic Steal with all my might, but it drained a lot of magic power. At this rate, I would only be able to maintain it for about a minute.  </p>
<p>(Master.  Please keep going like this.  I’ll find the nucleus.)</p>
<p>『Okay, I’ll protect you with everything I’ve got.  Fran, focus all your attention on finding the spirit’s nucleus.』</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
<p>  When Fran asked me to, I couldn’t let her do anything! I’m not even going to let a graze the skin of Fran’s orb!  I will protect Fran when she stops, by going at full power at the same time.  It’s not just about maintaining an evil barrier. It’s also about making sure it doesn’t affect Fran’s concentration as much as possible.  Even the slight fluctuation of her bangs may get in her way. She then concentrated on her magic and crisis detection, intercepting only the powerful attacks that seemed to break through her evil barrier.  </p>
<p>『Doryaaaaaaaaaaaaah!』</p>
<p>  The attacks of the Great Spirit were also more intense than ever. The power, the range, and the frequency of the attacks increased, and the walls of storms then covered our surroundings with multiple layers of force. We could see the earth being scraped into a bowl around the place where Fran was standing.  The magic power was in danger, but the chills were horrible.  At this rate, it would be quick until we felt the pain. It was really a dangerous signal if we went that far.  Was it still not there?  Kuuh――  </p>
<p>(Master! Got it!)</p>
<p>『Really!?』</p>
<p>  As expected of Fran!  Thank you very much!  </p>
<p>(Let’s get closer!)</p>
<p>『Alright!</p>
<p>「Nn!</p>
<p>「Nn! Let’s go!」</p>
