</div><h1>Chapter 1102</h1><p>「I see Alessa!」</p>
<p>Fran cheerfully shouted out as she saw the faint light of the city far into the darkness.</p>
<p>I guess it was because they had finally arrived in Alessa, who hadn’t been able to come back easily. In fact, I had heard some disturbing rumors along the way and was a little worried about her now.</p>
<p>She stopped for a meal at a certain town’s cafeteria.</p>
<p>「Did the Raidos army break through the border?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, it seems so」</p>
<p>「There must be many strong adventurers on the northern border」</p>
<p>「It doesn’t mean you lost, but the numbers must have pushed you back, huh? I heard we had the upper hand...... But you better be careful if you’re heading north.」</p>
<p>「Nn...」</p>
<p>Besides, there was one more thing that made Fran feel depressed. It was about the goblin dungeon we fought with the demons.</p>
<p>If we were to enter that dungeon, Nadia would be in a straight line for evolution. I would have much appreciated the hurry to release her. However, it seemed that there was another delay in our investigation due to this war.</p>
<p>We couldn’t hear anywhere from her that a new dungeon had been released in Alessa.</p>
<p>But still, did they manage to break through the border even though Amanda and Jean were supposed to be there? Was it related to the big plan of the Southern Duke that they had obtained from Hydeman?</p>
<p>「Master, let’s hurry!」</p>
<p>『Y-Yeah. You’re right.』</p>
<p>「Urushi! At full speed!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Sorry for yesterday, it’s just that we run out of edited chapter to be posted for the public, and my editor was struggling to keep up with this “one chapter per day” thing. I don’t even know if we’ll have any chapter done for tomorrow...</p>
<p>As a result of deviating from the roads and continuing to walk through the plains and forests at once, we had reached Alessa in front of us that night.</p>
<p>However, the atmosphere was causing a strange commotion here. Was it because it was during war or something?</p>
<p>No, that wasn’t it. As I got closer to Alessa, I realized why.</p>
<p>Bogogooooom!</p>
<p>In the darkness, an explosion of flames blossomed. It blooming. It blooming. It blooming.</p>
<p>Was it the soldiers of the Raidos Kingdom who were blown away by the impact? No, it was not a decent person to see them illuminated in the darkness for a moment.</p>
<p>Some had rotten faces and spilled eyeballs. Some had broken heads and saw what was inside. Some had their flesh cut off and had exposed white bones.</p>
<p>Yes, it was an army of undead that was assaulting Alessa.</p>
<p>The gate was still not broken, and a counterattack seemed to be taking place from the top of the wall.</p>
<p>『Hmm?』</p>
<p>「Did you see someone now?」</p>
<p>『You felt them too, huh?』</p>
<p>For just a moment, I felt a gaze on her. However, her presence immediately disappeared. I don’t think it was from Alessa, but...</p>
<p>「Master!」</p>
<p>『They’re over there now! But don’t attack them out of the blue, okay? I don’t even know if they’re just an army of undead or if Alessa’s side’s forces are being cut through』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>We decided to go to Alessa for the time being.</p>
<p>After the battle in Gordicia, she understood the importance of being a commander. She needed to listen to their instructions carefully instead of fighting on her own.</p>
<p>But how should we get in? If we suddenly approached the wall, we might get confused.</p>
<p>So, we decided to approach it conspicuously while illuminating ourselves with light magic. Urushi allowed himself to go in the shadows, and Fran was the only one.</p>
<p>It was unusual to see a beautiful girl glistening in the dark night sky, but I didn’t think she was immediately an enemy. Besides, there were many people in Alessa who remembered Fran.</p>
<p>He soon realized his true identity and welcomed us.</p>
<p>「Don’t tell me, Fran! Did you come to reinforcements?」</p>
<p>「Elevent.」</p>
<p>「This way! Come down!」</p>
<p>The first one to call out to us was the dwarven Elevent. He seemed to be in charge of the walls on the south side of the city.</p>
<p>They weren’t weak, but they were definitely D-ranked adventurers, right? No commander a little higher up there? But there were some circumstances too.</p>
<p>It seemed that the intercepting troops, mainly Amanda and Jean, were still fighting on the border. The army of undead that came to Alessa was said to be a small number of troops that passed through it.</p>
<p>To think that an army of undead, which could number in the thousands, would only be treated as a small army that had passed through the defense network... I wonder how much fierce the battle was going on in the front line.</p>
<p>However, Fran remained calm after hearing that. She had fought with more than 10,000 antidemons on the continent of Gordicia. She probably thought that there were only a few thousand of them undead.</p>
<p>「Who’s higher in rank than Elevent?」</p>
<p>「That’s why an enemy is entering a town. They’re chasing after it」</p>
<p>「!! That’s a disaster!」</p>
<p>「Yeah. That sounds pretty impressive. The Rank C adventurer in charge of the city walls was on his way to the chase. I had no choice but to command him.」</p>
<p>「I see...」</p>
<p>「The Lord’s building is my command office, and that’s where the guildmaster is. Can you hurry and show me your face?」</p>
<p>「What is this place?」</p>
<p>「Well, there are a lot of undead, but they’re not very strong. I’ll be fine for a while」</p>
<p>「Okay」</p>
<p>「Thank you for coming. You can still fight just by having a high-ranking adventurer come to the rescue」</p>
<p>In fact, the expressions on the adventurers around Elevent were brighter than before. They had the main forces dispatched, so we didn’t know if they would help us or not, and the opponent was unknown.</p>
<p>Then came the appearance of a high-ranked adventurer who had made a name for herself in Alessa. Even though she was just a little girl, there was no doubt about her abilities. They must have relieved her of some of their concerns.</p>
<p>「You want to use some kind of technique to defeat the undead?」</p>
<p>「Can’t you use a technique that purifies a large area?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Hmmm. No, wait a minute. There’s our fellow necromancers on the wall, and even the undead they manage will be taken down.」</p>
<p>I see. So even if Jean isn’t here, there are other necromancers out there.</p>
<p>「I’ll send them down, so go to the guildmaster first!」</p>
<p>「Okay」</p>
