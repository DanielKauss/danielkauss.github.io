</div><h1>Chapter 1042</h1><p>We managed to explain the Divine Sword to Nadia. It’s been an hour since we finished explaining the situation to her. We also talked about Lindwurm and the Oratrio, but Nadia was fine, right? In the first place, we’ve encountered a lot of people, and I’m sure the information will spread to other places. Apparently, Fran’s excitement was close to that of an elementary school kid telling her parents the secrets of her friends that she had learned at the academy by saying, “You shouldn’t tell anyone,”.

She was excited and explained the greatness of each Divine Sword to her.  </p>
<p>「I wonder if all the Divine Swords had been gathered together in one place.  I’m sure it was spectacular」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>「Also, I didn’t know that there was only one Discarded Divine Sword in there.  Maybe Master will be fine, but you’ll be careful, right? You’ll get caught up in it all of a sudden and make a lot of mistakes.」</p>
<p>『Yeah, I’ll keep that in mind.』</p>
<p> Nadia’s words, which I used Overgrowth for myself, were quite unconvinced. I’m sure she had made a lot of mistakes too.  Well, it was the pity of the warriors.  I won’t listen to her though.  </p>
<p>「Auntie, did you also fail?」</p>
<p>『Oh my!  I don’t want to hear that!』</p>
<p>「Hahahaha.  Well, a lot. I’ll tell you a few things.」</p>
<p>  As expected of Nadia, she had people. She smiled at Fran’s rude words and told her about the failures of herself and others in a fun way.  Fran listened to her story with bright eyes. But it didn’t take long to have fun.  When the sun began to set, the maid at the mansion told her it was time. Considering the burden Nadia would have for her from getting sick, staying here for too long was probably not a good idea. She was offered an accommodation, but we had to go to the Adventurers Guild first.  </p>
<p>『Can we have one last time?』</p>
<p>「What is it?」</p>
<p>『What does Nadia plan to do in the future?  Will she stay on this continent? Or do you want to evolve?』</p>
<p> That’s important. If things don’t go smoothly, Fran’s future behavior will be affected.  </p>
<p>「Well, I’m going to leave this continent to you for now.  I won’t be able to hunt fiends here. And the gravekeepers will be closed too.」</p>
<p>  As expected, they were planning to evolve. </p>
<p>「Then I’ll fight――」</p>
<p>「No way.」</p>
<p>「Why!」</p>
<p>「I don’t want to pull you off. I’ve lost Overgrowth, so I’m just a liability.」</p>
<p>「No, that’s not what I’m talking about. I would never let an aunt stall like that!」</p>
<p>「Yeah, I know it.」</p>
<p>  Fran said that wasn’t the case, but Nadia’s stats had actually dropped by almost half. It would have been the effect of losing Overgrowth and lowering her level.  In Castel, the upper limit of her level was Nadia, which had exceeded the Black Cat kin, but perhaps due to the return of her race to the Black Cat kin, her level had been reduced to 45. Many of her skills have been reduced, and her equipment had been broken in the defensive battle at Castel. Their strength, which used to be on par with Rank A adventurers, was now between Rank B and C.  It’s one of the strongest black cats before evolution, but nothing more.  Moreover, they were not in top form right now. She shouldn’t be able to unleash her true stats, which is why Nadia knows all about it.  </p>
<p>「There are quite a few black cats on this continent.  This is a land where you can live as long as you’re prepared to fight.  It’s a great training ground, and it’s much easier to move in than the other areas where the blue cats have a advantage.  I’m thinking of bringing those guys with me to the Beast Kingdom. Schwarzkatse―― I didn’t know there was a Black Cat Kin’s village.」</p>
<p>  Coming from a country other than the Beast Kingdom, they couldn’t imagine there would be any Black Cat Kin’s village. </p>
<p>「Fran has accepted a request, right?  Then I’ll have to go back to report it. I’m an adventurer after all.」</p>
<p>「...... Nn.」</p>
<p>  Fran’s selfishness was then sealed away by being treated as a full-fledged adventurer. She probably really wanted to leave the request alone and go to the Beast Kingdom with Nadia, but if she said that, she would be scolded. Fran nodded reluctantly.  </p>
<p>「Then, I’ll leave Mea to you!  Say hi to the Auntie! I’m sure she’ll take you to the Beast Kingdom!」</p>
<p>「She’s the princess who said she has Lindwilm, right?  Are you okay? I don’t know the rules of etiquette in front of royalty, you know?」</p>
<p>  Nadia sniffed after hearing Mea’s name. If she wanted to meet the Beast Princess, it couldn’t be helped.  But this was just a normal reaction. Well, Mea didn’t look like a princess, so she should be fine.  </p>
<p>「Mea is fine」</p>
<p>「But that doesn’t seem to be the case.」</p>
<p>「Mea is not a princess at all. She’s just like a normal adventurer, so it’s no problem」</p>
<p>  Well, Fran also thought that Mea was not like a princess. After all, most people think that Fran, who didn’t know much about nobles or anything like that, was not interested in her.  </p>
<p>「Well, I don’t have any rumors about her, so it can’t be helped huh...  Alright!  I’m prepared for it! I’d love to introduce her!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>『It won’t be possible for today, but I’ll bring it with me tomorrow onwards』</p>
<p>「No, wait!  I’ll go! There’s no way you can do anything so reckless if you call me!」</p>
<p>「No!  Auntie can’t move yet!」</p>
<p>「Gnrgh......」</p>
<p>  Well, it’s the continent of Gordicia, where things are going to get harder in the future. It would be a good thing if we could bring Nadia and other black cats here. </p>
<p>「Yeah, at least I need Mulsani to put on some better clothes for us......!」</p>
<p>The image of Mea in Fran...</p>
