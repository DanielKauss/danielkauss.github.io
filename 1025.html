</div><h1>Chapter 1025</h1><p>「You’ve run out......? What do you mean?」</p>
<p> The Silver Lady suddenly appeared and saved us. Fran retorted, perhaps feeling something in her words, </p>
<p>『Let’s use up my body the most effectively』</p>
<p>. However, the Silver Lady did not answer the question and shadowed her hand toward me, dodging the magic bullets from the antidemons. </p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>「Intelligence-sharing...... Securing a route.」</p>
<p>『Wh-What are you trying to do?』</p>
<p>「We share information with others.」</p>
<p>「We’re sharing the same kind of existence and information.」</p>
<p>《Yes.  Confirming the sharing of information and areas. Temporary return to normal.》</p>
<p> You mean Announcer-san when you say she is the same species?!  It seems that Announcer-san has temporarily awakened by some kind of connection with the Silver Lady. She is a too-reliable reinforcement in this last minute situation!  </p>
<p>《Jump.  teleportation.》</p>
<p>『O-Okay!』</p>
<p>  Maybe it was thanks to Announcer-san’s support, I was confident that I could teleport without any problems. Following that feeling, I activated my long-distance teleportation.  Thanks to her being far away from the giant antidemons, my chase stopped. However, the true purpose of the Silver Lady was not to resurrect Announcer-san and let us escape. </p>
<p>「Excuse me of obtaining information.」</p>
<p>《Synchronization complete......  Are you sure?》</p>
<p>「No problem.  It’s more meaningful than just rotting.」</p>
<p>《...... I won’t waste any of it.》</p>
<p>「Thank you.」</p>
<p>  What do you mean? It seemed that they understood what they were going to do now by sharing information on a deeper level...  </p>
<p>『Hey, what are you talking about?』</p>
<p> I felt a somewhat restless or disturbing atmosphere. My danger detection wasn’t working, but can I let them do what they were trying to do?  </p>
<p>《I’m sorry. But it’s necessary》</p>
<p>「I’m the one to take care of everything. You don’t have to worry about it」</p>
<p>『So!  What do you mean――』</p>
<p> Just as I was about to ask for more details.  My sword blade lifted――and it snapped.  </p>
<p>『Wha!』</p>
<p>「Master!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  My voice of astonishment overlapped with Urushi’s scream from Fran and the shadows.  </p>
<p>「Why!?」</p>
<p>『W-It’s not me!  Announcer-san! What’s going on!?』</p>
<p>  My blade moved on its own and pierced the Silver Lady’s chest. I guess it was because she didn’t expect me to make such a move that Fran couldn’t stop her gripping hand. Her eyes widened as she looked into her own arms, unable to believe the feeling coming from her hand.  It was Announcer-san who just moved me.  Wasn’t she friendly? With us flustered elsewhere, the Silver Lady shook her head with the same excitement as ever.  </p>
<p>「Don’t worry.  It’s what I wanted」</p>
<p>「W-Why...?」</p>
<p>「Just like I said.  To make effective use of my body」</p>
<p> The Silver Lady gently put her hand on my blade that pierced herself and smiled.  </p>
<p>「Are you ready?」</p>
<p>《Yes.  I’m going to start the Integration》</p>
<p>  Immediately after, I saw a huge amount of power flowing into me. It wasn’t just magic power being provided, it was something more important. It was something, more importantly.  It felt like my system was being filled with strange power and strengthened. </p>
<p>『R-Really......!』</p>
<p>「!」</p>
<p>  Fran tried to pull me out, but she couldn’t. With me, the Silver Lady’s body was pulled over and fell into Fran’s hand.  The Silver Lady’s body, held by Fran, was motionless.  It was like a corpse, but it was originally a golem without flesh and blood. It was hard to tell what kind of state she was.  The Silver Lady was in Fran’s arms, but a change came soon. As if her whole body was glistening slightly, it began to crumble into pieces of light from the tips of her hair and the tips of her fingers.  </p>
<p>「Her body!」</p>
<p>「No problem」</p>
<p>『No problem, huh...!  Oioi, what’s going on...! Wai!  The light!』</p>
<p>《No problem.  Please accept it as it is》</p>
<p>『No, it’s because!』</p>
<p>  The light converted into the Silver Lady’s body gathered around me as if it was pulled toward my blade. Not only that, but it was clearly absorbed into me.  It wasn’t something I was doing. Apparently, both Announcer-san and the Silver Lady’s will were at work.  While I was surprised, I could feel the power returning.  The power that had worn and worn me out on this continent had healed. On the contrary, I could see that it was getting stronger.  In particular, it was Announcer-san.  </p>
<p>『Announcer-san, maybe I and Announcer-san can feel it』</p>
<p>《By absorbing the power of the individual named hope bearer, the provisional named Announcer-san’s available space has been temporarily expanded.》</p>
<p>『Should the temporary thing be returned to normal soon?』</p>
<p>《In this state, the Provisional named Master will be in a great burden.  I will immediately return to Master》</p>
<p>『Also, do you mean the Silver Lady by the “Hostile bearer”?』</p>
<p>《Yes》</p>
<p>  The carrier of hope... Is that the name that the Divine blacksmith Zechs gave her?  I don’t know who she was, but I’m sure he wanted to defeat the antidemons somehow. To do so, she must have raised Overgrowth and created her bearer, the Silver Lady.  </p>
<p>『Hey, is this good? To give my power to you......』</p>
<p>「Yes. I thought this was perfect for making your wishes come true, or for leaving proof of your existence.」</p>
<p>《All the information I absorb will be returned in sync》</p>
<p>『Whoa!』</p>
<p>  The power that I felt faintly increases my presence clearly.  And I could feel it taking a clear shape inside me.  </p>
<p>『The magic seems to be... getting better?』</p>
<p> That’s amazing!  I can control my magic power the way I want it to!  With this, I can use both extreme magic and skills perfectly!  The Silver Lady smiled, as if she could feel the emotions I was happy about. A beautiful smile that could not be expected from a golem.  </p>
<p>「It is an honor to be of use. I was able to carry hope at the end of my life......?」</p>
<p>『!』</p>
<p>The body of the bearer of hope shone brighter than before and turned rapidly into the light.  </p>
<p>『Yeah!  This power! It is the greatest hope for us right now!』</p>
<p>「Fufu, thank you...」</p>
<p>  After leaving those words behind, the bearer of hope was sucked into me.  It was no longer there, but I certainly felt a new power.</p>
<p>『Thank you very much』</p>
