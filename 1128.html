</div><h1>Chapter 1128</h1><p>The battle at the Swift Fort was unfolding with the Kranzel army at its ready from the start.</p>
<p>Before we knew it, the undead were all around us, and the red armored knights attacked us head-on.</p>
<p>There were over 2,000 undead, but there were only about 200 of them, so the red knights were unusually strong.</p>
<p>「Donad-san! This is bad! The Raydoss army appeared behind the fort!」</p>
<p>「Another one, huh!? What’s wrong with the front!?」</p>
<p>「I’m trying to hold them back with the knights, but these guys are terrible!」</p>
<p>「That must be the red knights!」</p>
<p>The scouting adventurers that we had scouted out came in one after another, but there was not even a single good source.</p>
<p>The red knight.</p>
<p>That made me remember too. The knights of this country that the captives had mentioned before.</p>
<p>The strongest knights in the world, clad in red armor, were unbounded in restraint and continued to protect the security of the country.</p>
<p>I knew it was powerful, but I didn’t know it was this strong. The Raydoss knights that appeared in the table during the invasion were just like small fry compared to the red knights!</p>
<p>「Gyaaah! Help me!」</p>
<p>「Guf......! How pathetic.」</p>
<p>「A-At once!」</p>
<p>Even though the knights, soldiers, and adventurers combined were nearly five times larger in number, their march did not stop. They were overwhelmingly defeated in a melee battle.</p>
<p>If new recruits appeared then we would be attacked from three directions. It would be dangerous to do something about it.</p>
<p>The only screams I could hear belonged to my friends.</p>
<p>Moreover, flame magic sometimes flew in and caused a huge explosion. There was a barrier to prevent magic, but it couldn’t cover a wide area enough to prevent everything.</p>
<p>They must have high-ranking magic knights. Each adventurer was a C ranker or higher, and the commander must be a B ranker.</p>
<p>All of them were working together as knights. They were terrifyingly strong, and the adventurers were also suffering from a lot of injuries.</p>
<p>What a worthy commander. I could hear my teeth creaking as I bit into it. Still, I could only inspire my comrades.</p>
<p>I want to go forward and use this huge figure as a shield to protect my comrades and my subordinates. However, that is not something to be tolerated. I am the only one among us who has the experience of leading such a large number of people.</p>
<p>If I leave my posts, the commander will be confused and the damage will be more severe.</p>
<p>「Send a message to Forrund! We need him back!」</p>
<p>「Understood!」</p>
<p>「Donad-san! The nobles in the back are in big trouble! It looks like some nobles were attacked from behind and died here!」</p>
<p>「Tsk! Can’t we just leave them alone too! Okay! I’m going to cover the nobles in the back. Let’s kick the undead and break through the encirclement along with them!」</p>
<p>「Y-yes!」</p>
<p>「The vanguard will rush in with me! The rearguard, along with the scout!」</p>
<p>It would be dangerous if we had to distance ourselves from the fort and rebuild ourselves. That’s why I led the adventurers to launch a strike backwards. I sent a messenger to tell the knights about our movements. They would get in sync with us.</p>
<p>「We’re going in.」</p>
<p>「「「「Woooh!」」」」</p>
<p>The undead were quite strong.</p>
<p>At first glance, they looked like normal zombies or skeletons, but their movements were quick and strong. The fact that they could move forward without any pain was making them more troublesome than normal humans.</p>
<p>The unexpected resistance slowed down our charge. At this rate, it was dangerous. The red knights were still approaching us from behind.</p>
<p>「Kill the fools in Kranzel!」</p>
<p>「Use their blood to dye this land!」</p>
<p>「Kill them all!」</p>
<p>Each time a cry similar to the roar of the red knights echoed, the people on our side perished. And our enemies were not ready for combat yet.</p>
<p>「burn, burn! Turn into ashes by my vermilion flames!」</p>
<p>Just as a loud voice rang out, a huge magic circle was drawn to the sky. Even a warrior like me, who was slow to notice magic power, could feel it.</p>
<p>That was dangerous, a kind of magic that could bring death to us.</p>
<p>As everyone gasped, red flashes of light rained down from the shining magic circle. They pierced the barrier and caused a huge explosion.</p>
<p>It’s similar to the flame magic that Fran used at the entrance of the goblin dungeon before, but this one is much more powerful and numerous.</p>
<p>「Gyaaah!」</p>
<p>「Y-Yes sir...」</p>
<p>Burned by the red flames scattered all over, his friends fell to the ground. Burning, charring, and shattering.</p>
<p>My friends were dying here.</p>
<p>I can’t do anything. All I can do is encourage my comrades and swing my axe against the undead. And I have to escape from this dead area before there is any more damage!</p>
<p>But my wishes were not fulfilled, and a magic circle was drawn again to the sky. Shit, it was close to our army of adventurers.</p>
<p>This time it might cause more damage than before.</p>
<p>It’s worthless!</p>
<p>I had no anger at my enemies, no resentment at the nobles who had pushed through my reckless mission. What I had in my mind was anger at myself for being incompetent enough to save my comrades.</p>
<p>Burning emotions, as if to ignite even this body.</p>
<p>So, this was true anger.</p>
<p>I’ve been called a child who had changed since I was a child. I’ve been told that I was a calm and intelligent demonkin. Of course, I couldn’t compare with people and elves.</p>
<p>However, in a demonkin who often acted based on emotions, she was a child of peace and quiet. She sometimes got angry, but this may be the first time in her life that she had acquired such strong emotions.</p>
<p>I hate my weakness! Why am I so weak! Why can’t I protect my comrades when my body is so big? This wooden stick is!</p>
<p>It’s worthless!</p>
<p>「Nrrrrr!」</p>
<p>「Eh? D-Donad-san? Something is glowing in your body!」</p>
<p>「It’s pointless!」</p>
<p>「Donad-san! That’s getting pretty horned!」</p>
<p>「Ghrroaaaah!」</p>
