</div><h1>Chapter 1017</h1><p>Ader, who was already in the Divine Sword Release state, launched an attack on the giant antidemon.</p>
<p>That’s a Divine Sword. Even though Ader’s level has decreased a little, its power was still immense. The compressed Divine Power blade extending from the Divine Sword easily severed the legs of the giant antidemons.</p>
<p>It was an overwhelming slash that made me wonder if she had sliced through the entire space. Moreover, it didn’t end with a single blow.</p>
<p>Twisted Horn’s legs were sliced open by multiple slashes, and his huge body slammed into the earth.</p>
<p>The scene was so unrealistic that it felt like I was about to lose some of my dwarves in a bill.</p>
<p>However, the lost legs immediately begin to regenerate. It was as if I was watching the tree species grow in an instant and grow into a large tree at a tremendous speed.</p>
<p>As expected, it wouldn’t regenerate in an instant, but it would take less than 30 seconds for that super huge leg to return to its original state.</p>
<p>Seeing that, Ader gnashed his teeth.</p>
<p>「As long as they’re top antidemons, that’s until they’re exterminated!」</p>
<p>Certainly, I would be able to defeat it as long as it was erased to the point that it could no longer regenerate... But, is it even possible to use a Divine Sword?</p>
<p>It was already huge and strong, but because it had infinite magic power from the Abyss Eater, it had top-class regenerative power and barriers.</p>
<p>「Are you sure?」</p>
<p>「...My sword is Silard’s most powerful divine sword of honor! You can defeat an enemy of this level with your trump card!」</p>
<p>It was as if she was telling herself. It may not be a lie, but it doesn’t seem to be her true intention. It was as if she was trying to inspire herself to be like that.</p>
<p>However, Addler did not release her strongest move right now.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I felt the presence of a large number of people around the giant antidemon. There, more than a thousand troops suddenly appeared.</p>
<p>At the center of it was a short female dwarve that exuded intimidation that pierced through her skin, and a demonkin woman clad in mana with the evil spirit attribute.</p>
<p>「Fuahahaha! Snorabbit army, come on watch!」</p>
<p>「Ahahaha! Now that’s the recommendation of the Demon Lord! He’s so intelligent! Please refrain from doing so!」</p>
<p>They were the queens leading the dwarven and demonkin.</p>
<p>Just like before, Jayne’s abilities must have been hiding the entire army. Her stealth was so great that even we couldn’t detect it in the middle of a battle. Moreover, the Demon Lord and his guards appeared.</p>
<p>This would be much more troublesome than an army of tens of thousands. Considering how it’s against a large army or a nation, it would be much more dangerous than just one of those weaklings.</p>
<p>Was it okay to expose this ability to the Holy Nation and Snorabbit? That country is dangerous, so I wouldn’t be surprised if the logic of attacking first was used.</p>
<p>I don’t know Orfalve and the other dwarves would be able to trust the Holy Nation...... Is this because they’re at a distance where they don’t need to worry about being attacked? Or maybe they have a secret technique that could even teach them all their stealth abilities?</p>
<p>Seeing the queen’s army, Addle stopped attacking and patted them lightly. She couldn’t seem to do anything that could get them caught in the middle of it.</p>
<p>「Got it!」</p>
<p>「「「Yeah!」」」</p>
<p>In front of us, the dwarves, enhanced by the demonkin’s support magic, began their all-out attack. The target was their right leg, which was still in the regeneration stage.</p>
<p>「Yeah!」</p>
<p>「Doryaaaaah!」</p>
<p>Despite his bold shouts, his movements were perfectly under control.</p>
<p>Dozens of dwarves delivered a single blow at exactly the same time, packed with the most magic power possible.</p>
<p>They unleashed dozens of powerful slashes at the same time, each capable of defeating a huge tree with a single blow. Even the barrier of a giant antidemon was easily broken through.</p>
<p>The shock of an explosion greatly gouged out the antidemon’s armor and sent it flying. It was regenerating quickly, but before it could fully regenerate, the next attack was fired.</p>
<p>The dwarves formed a five-row formation, switching their fronts one after another and continuing to strike with all their might.</p>
<p>But it’s not like the giant antidemons were just kept getting beaten up. They simply extended their arms and slammed them against the dwarves. Just like high-rise buildings collapsing with great force.</p>
<p>Fran raised her voice involuntarily, but the dwarves remained still.</p>
<p>「Shield Brigade!」</p>
<p>「「「Yeah!」」」</p>
<p>In response to the queen’s voice, the dwarves, who had been standing on either side of her, stepped forward. They continued to hold up their huge shield above their heads. Then, they shouted at the same time.</p>
<p>「「「Silence Saint Technique, Power Shield!」」」</p>
<p>It was a spectacular sight. By concentrating and at the same time activating the shield art, it looked like a huge shield. The magic shields of the dwarves caught the attention of the giant antidemons and repelled them.</p>
<p>Apparently, the shield itself was a powerful magic tool, which had the effect of increasing the strength of the shield techniques. Even if it was, I didn’t expect it to stop me or push me back. Moreover, he even calculated the direction in which it would be repelled.</p>
<p>The giant antidemon had its arms deflected outwards, disrupting its balance. Perhaps aiming for this, Jayne ordered the demonkin to strike at once.</p>
<p>As a result, the giant antidemon fell to its back again. It may have been too big to control it. This area was just like the giant antidemon’s.</p>
<p>The combined army of dwarves and demonkin embodied the tremendous power of the group. But for some reason, the two queens looked bitter.</p>
<p>「This is no good too」</p>
<p>「You can say that again. We’ll lose at this rate」</p>
<p>To my surprise, a weak word came out of her mouth.</p>
<p>「That’s impossible then?」</p>
<p>「Indeed. This is no use. Black Lightning Princess, you know that well, don’t you? Even with that monstrous regeneration power, magic power won’t diminish. On the contrary, it’s continuing to increase, you know?」</p>
<p>「Shaving its power little by little will be meaningless. If I wanted to go all out, I’d have to give it a shot.」</p>
<p>「We can still hold them back now, but we’ll run out of strength eventually」</p>
<p>「This is the first time I’ve ever seen an enemy this troublesome.」</p>
<p>I knew it, their conclusions were the same. I was thinking about the same thing too. In the end, it was unlikely that we would be able to defeat it unless we had completely eliminated its entire body so that it could not be regenerated.</p>
