</div><h1>Chapter 961</h1><p>When Fran and the others arrived at the gate, the situation there had become quite miserable.</p>
<p>Outside the gate, the adventurers were fighting against the antidemons with shouts of hostility, and inside, many injured were lined up. Most of the Bourtorian adventurers were gathered, and half of them were unable to fight.</p>
<p>The army of antidemons was already close to the city walls, so it was unlikely to last half an hour.</p>
<p>「Hey young miss! Can you recover? If you can’t, I’ll go rescue the injured!」</p>
<p>「I can heal you! Isario, take care of it!」</p>
<p>「Yosh! I’m counting on you!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Fran loves Isario a lot and respects him. I could tell that by the looks she gave me.</p>
<p>That freedom was probably because it was close to her ideal. There was no way that Fran would not be motivated by such Isario’s request.</p>
<p>(Master, let’s help everyone!)</p>
<p>『Yeah! We’ll launch a series of Circle Heal and move first to make sure no one dies. Still, those who are dangerous will be healed later by Greater Heal』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Fran landed on the main street and checked the surroundings.</p>
<p>「Uuu...」</p>
<p>「Gah...」</p>
<p>「Sigh......」</p>
<p>Over a hundred adventurers had been laid down, and the vast majority of them had been left unattended. Those who could fight were blocking the invasion of antidemons outside the walls, and those who could not fight were unable to move because of their magic absorption.</p>
<p>There were people who looked like town doctors giving first aid, and healers were running around. However, due to the absorption of magic power and the sickness, they couldn’t move as usual and couldn’t use magic. It was not that bad, but I didn’t think I could save everyone.</p>
<p>Fran kept walking down the main street where the wounded adventurers were laid down, while casting a series of ranged healing spells.</p>
<p>Since they were given priority, the recovery rate per person was rather low. Those with severe wounds would not be able to recover at all, but they should be able to save their lives.</p>
<p>After Fran and I used Circle Heal about twenty times, most of the adventurers must have been saved. They then started to stand up with a surprised look on their faces.</p>
<p>She suddenly felt her wounds had healed and didn’t seem to know what had happened. She was looking around with a scurry.</p>
<p>But there were only a few who could not get up yet. Some of them had already lost their sanity, and some had not fully recovered because of severe wounds.</p>
<p>I will offer my congratulations to those who are no longer awake, and cast Greater Heal on the serious wounded.</p>
<p>「Phew......... This guy is the last one.」</p>
<p>『Okay, let’s go to the outsiders.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran turned on her heel, but a panicked voice appeared on her back.</p>
<p>「W-Where are you going!?」</p>
<p>There was a town doctor with a white beard. The old man looked worried as he was looking at Fran as she was about to head for the city walls.</p>
<p>「I’ve done my job here, so I’m going to help out outside.」</p>
<p>「There’s no need for your precious healers to go out! Stay here until the battle is over!」</p>
<p>「I’m fine」</p>
<p>「What are you talking about! Leave the dangerous part to the adventurers!」</p>
<p>He must be a person who came all the way to the side of the battlefield for first aid if they wanted to escape. Basically, he was a good person. His tone may sound like great, but the worry of turning to Fran was real.</p>
<p>He seemed to think Fran was a healer. Well, it couldn’t be helped that she didn’t think she would even fight at this age. Besides, she didn’t have to be an adventurer to wear armor on this continent, so you wouldn’t know if she was an adventurer just by looking at her.</p>
<p>「Don’t worry」</p>
<p>「Wha? Wait――」</p>
<p>The old man tried to hold them back even more, but Fran ignored them and headed for the wall. He probably didn’t want to spend time explaining this emergency to them.</p>
<p>With the eyes of the old man and the adventurers who realized that Fran had healed them, she used an aerial jump to jump over the city walls.</p>
<p>From there, we could see the battlefield below us.</p>
<p>「A lot of antidemons, a lot of wounded people.」</p>
<p>『We’re left behind.』</p>
<p>They already had no time to transport the injured to the walls. Dead bodies and injured were gathered in one place and laid down so that they could be abandoned.</p>
<p>「Let’s go help.」</p>
<p>『Yeah! Even the surrounding antidemons will do the trick, so let’s recover first.』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>When Fran landed in front of the city wall, she healed the injured who were unable to move and eliminated a few antidemons. The adventurers around her noticed her there.</p>
<p>In order to heal their wounds, Fran used more recovery magic. Fortunately, most adventurers were gathering in front of the gate despite the misfortune, probably because they were being pushed by antidemons.</p>
<p>That’s why we were able to heal quite a few adventurers.</p>
<p>Isario, who went to the rescue before we did, was a short distance away from the gate. He seemed to be attracted to the antidemons with his defensive style as usual.</p>
<p>Isario, who had not been attacking conspicuously while dispersing a huge amount of magic power, must have looked like a treat to the antidemons.</p>
<p>Aside from the antidemons in battle near the gate, most of the remaining antidemons were focused on Isario. This had apparently helped reduce the pressure on the adventurers significantly.</p>
<p>Now that Fran appeared more there, the adventurers had a little more leeway.</p>
<p>「I-I’m saved」</p>
<p>「I’m going to rebuild while I’m still alive」</p>
<p>「Y-yes!」</p>
<p>The adventurers seemed to know about Fran, and began to quietly follow our instructions.</p>
<p>That said, we couldn’t get any closer to Isario. The adventurers had to guard the gate, and Fran held back the antidemons in front of it.</p>
<p>If the antidemons really did look at us, we would have used a wide area attack to immediately go on the offensive, but Isario’s hate control was perfect.</p>
<p>By daring to keep releasing magic power around herself, she must have attracted the antidemons’ attention to herself until the very end. After many years of fighting on this continent, she understood exactly how much magic power they released and how much of an antidemon would recognize her.</p>
<p>「That’s all that remains is a large one」</p>
<p>『Yeah』</p>
<p>In the direction of Fran’s scowl, I saw the giant antidemon sleeping with its knees, the culprit of this situation.</p>
