</div><h1>Chapter 1121</h1><p>The valiant soldiers shivered when they saw Fran slowly raise her head after a dozen seconds of silence. They were probably terrified of what Fran, who seemed to be angry, would do. In the midst of all this, Fran first went to store the carriage. She removed all the horses and finished off the cargo. As for the horses, she handed all the reins to Mareficent. </p>
<p>「You can ride the horses, and take the rest with you」</p>
<p>「It’s okay to ride on horses, so take the rest of the horses with you」</p>
<p>「Eh?  It would be more exhausting to ride on horses though」</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>  With Mareficent, Persona nodded too. However, Fran forced her to push her bridle.  </p>
<p>「He said he’ll do chores」</p>
<p>「Is this a chore?」</p>
<p>「Nn, chores」</p>
<p>「Haah. After confirming Mareficent’s nod, Fran turned to the warriors. </p>
<p>「We won’t be bothering them if we just take you guys with us」</p>
<p>「Huh? Umm, what do you mean――?」</p>
<p>「They don’t listen to you annoyingly and it’s too late to steal your food. Even if I take you to the front lines, it would just get in your way」</p>
<p>  Fran’s straightforward words made a commotion among the warriors.  However, no one seemed to be opposed to her. Fran seemed to have remembered the anger she had for these people as she spoke, and there was a disturbing presence emanating from them.  Because of this, she probably thought that those who were being beaten for making a bad statement would be treated the same as those who were shown to her. Though she was frustrated, she remained silent. In a heavy atmosphere, Fran slowly walked in front of the soldiers and talked about the future.  </p>
<p>「You might be better off throwing them away here so they don’t get in the way」</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>  It was not because of anger, but because of fear. I guess the word “throw them away” sounded like a way for the soldiers to cut down and bury them. But it was no wonder they misunderstood Fran’s angry expression.  </p>
<p>「But they might be useful if you regenerate them」</p>
<p>「Y-You’re going to be regenerated?」</p>
<p>「Nn.  So―― running?」</p>
<p>「Huh?」</p>
<p>「First, you need to train in a formation.  I thought about beating them all here and telling them to run.  But that would make them all beat up in time, so I decided to train while running. That’s why we decided to train while running.  First, the training to be able to run without breaking the formation」</p>
<p>  Immediately after Fran said that, the valiant soldiers had formed a formation incredibly quickly without skirmishing.Immediately after Fran said that, the warriors formed a formation without any skirmishes.  It was not as distorted as it had been in the past, but rather a clean formation like a well-trained soldier.  They should be able to do it.  </p>
<p>「Now then, let’s keep the formation going and keep running at the same speed」</p>
<p>「Sure, can I ask you a question?」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>「I-How long should I run!?」</p>
<p>「Just until I say it’s okay」</p>
<p>「Th-what does that mean in the end...?」</p>
<p>  The man asked me more, but Fran just frowned. After all, Fran only thought of running on her own, and didn’t know what was the right thing to do.  However, Fran’s troubled look also seemed to be irritated for the brave soldiers. They immediately began to run after swallowing their complaints.  So, Fran’s Bootcamp began. They were led by Mareficent and the others on horses, with the valiant soldiers following behind them, and Fran stared from the tail.  That was why they were so serious at first... Even if they had high abilities, they would get exhausted if they had been running for a long time.  In the first place, there were differences in their stamina.  Those who weren’t very strong began to gradually disrupt their formation.  But Fran did not allow them to fall out.  She sent stamina heals flying and running them for a long time. However, she did not dare to curse anyone who didn’t have enough strength.  What Fran wouldn’t allow was those who didn’t know what to do or didn’t want to do. If those people were to disturb the formation even a little, her magic would mercilessly fly. Well, rather than letting them get a direct hit, she was just going to tell them that they had been a little off by letting them snatch them away.  However, the problem children were not even able to handle the guild in the first place.  When she misunderstood that Fran didn’t want to apply magic directly, she began to take a lick at her.  She was running slower to take a break or just falling. As time went by, her fear of Fran faded. But as Fran was just trying to drive them away, a man shouted out.  </p>
<p>「 captain!」</p>
<p>「What?」</p>
<p>「I’m almost hungry! I know I’m gonna die from getting hungry at this rate!」</p>
<p>  He told us that with a grin.  Did he think Fran wouldn’t get angry if he wasn’t bad at it?  However, Fran slashed at him.  </p>
<p>「No food until you’re able to run properly」</p>
<p>「Huh?」</p>
<p>「I’ve been running again for now」</p>
<p>  Being hungry was much more painful than simple violence to Fran, who was a slave. In other words, it was not surprising that Fran, who was trying to drive the warriors into battle, thought about missing her meal.  </p>
<p>「Fu-fuzaken!」</p>
<p>「I’m not joking」</p>
<p>「Shut up!  Can you fucking keep up with me now!  Oi!  You bastards!  Do you want to keep up with this shitty brat!? I’ll crush them all!」</p>
<p>「...O-ou!」</p>
<p>「Just fucking do it!」</p>
<p>  About ten people responded to the man’s voice and started walking out of the formation.  All of them seemed to be at the limit of their patience.  They were pathetic after a three-hour run.  Well, if it had been on Earth, it would have been on par with a full run. Fran had healed them, so they shouldn’t have gotten that tired.  The others were waiting to see what would happen, and they didn’t stop the men. They were secretly expecting Fran to be eliminated if it hadn’t been for a while.  Fran sensed such an atmosphere and decided to re-established the hierarchical relationship here. It would be a good idea to leave them all behind here.  She walked forward, clenching her fists.  </p>
<p>「I’ll train you a little.」</p>
<p>  She seemed to be quite annoyed by the brave warriors that stood in her way even though she wanted to go to the battlefield quickly. Don’t let your guards get any closer!  At any rate, it’s already settled that the brave soldiers will break their hearts and become obedient.Fran sensed such an atmosphere and decided to re-established the hierarchical relationship here.
