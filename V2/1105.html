</div><h1>Chapter 1105</h1><p>When we arrived at the top of the wall, the situation had undergone a sudden change. There was also the appearance of an undead on top of the wall. And several of them. Apparently, ghouls with long claws had climbed up the wall. They hadn’t noticed it because of the darkness. It was not a strong opponent, but they seemed to be different in the darkness. Moreover, there were some low-ranked adventurers and young soldiers who were dealing with the situation. </p>
<p>(Master!)</p>
<p>『Ou! Let’s take care of it first!』</p>
<p> Let’s take care of it first!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  Fran stepped in and quickly defeated the ghouls that were raging on. They didn’t seem to be special individuals as expected.  The adventurers around her froze at the appearance of the girl who had cut down the four ghouls in an instant. However, soon after, there was a great cheer.  </p>
<p>『Fran. Let’s kick the undead so flashy and raise their morale even more』</p>
<p>「Okay.」</p>
<p>『Urushi, find anyone around you.』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  But before we could do that, we just checked with the event.  </p>
<p>「What about the necromancers in here?」</p>
<p>「We’ve already lowered them! The upper and lower parts of the wall are all undead enemies!」</p>
<p>『Alright!  Then don’t worry about them being so flashy!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p> Urushi’s bottomless shadow would be very effective if he could just deal with the undead that were gathered under the wall.  He could defeat a wide area of undead without damaging the wall. After all, they were all low-ranked zombies that looked like they couldn’t be expected from magic stones.  After all, it was now nighttime.  Dark magic was the time to shine its most. Now, hundreds of them could be gathered together and swallowed into the shadows. However, there was one problem.  It was very plain. If they used a spell that made a shadow swallow an enemy at night when they had poor vision, everyone wouldn’t know what was going on.  That wouldn’t raise morale. If that was the case, then the adventurers would be more excited when a beautiful girl flicked away their enemies with a flashy attack.  </p>
<p>『First, let’s go with a huge fireworks display!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p> As Fran and I jumped out of the walls into the air, we threw magic at the undead below us.  It was a multiple activations of the Flare Explosion Fire Magic.  It was an aggressive technique that could attack a wide area.  A series of huge explosions occurred, and I could see the surrounding spirits flying in shatters. Some of them were burning like a torch, and the damage was expanding by hitting their friends. The adventurers were cheering loudly. </p>
<p>『Next is the Purification Magic!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  A pure white light then spread out at once, eroding the darkness of the night. The undead that had touched the light collapsed one after another.  The only technique that had a weak effect was to dispel the undead, but when we, who had high magic power, could change the story. It became a powerful anti-dead magic that cleansed the undead. While leaping around the walls in the air, the undead were wiped out in no time at all.While leaping around the walls in the air, the undead were wiped out in no time at all.  The darkness had now covered them, but there were probably scattered sand-like remains around the walls that had been created from the undead that had collapsed.  Should we do this tomorrow?  Should I ask the adventurers for help?  I knew that the morale I had built up would just drop.  </p>
<p>『Urushi, how’s it?』</p>
<p>(Woof woof!)</p>
<p>『Found it!  I’m going now!』</p>
<p>  To my surprise, Urushi had found a suspicious person. We headed for the spot as if he had been captured.  On a hill about a kilometer from Alessa, a man who was swallowed in darkness was being captured with a limp look on his face. He must have run out of energy and enthusiasm for escape. It was not a Bottomless Shadow, but a technique called Shadow Bind. </p>
<p>「Urushi, this guy is the one?」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「W-who is he!?」</p>
<p>  The man looked at us with a frightened expression.  </p>
<p>「That’s my line. Who are you?」</p>
<p>「O-I’m an adventurer.  This is an urgent message to let you know what’s going on in the north.  If I was heading to Alessa, all I’d do is...」</p>
<p>「Hmm」</p>
<p>「Is this wolf your servant? I’m begging you, so can you release the restraints?」</p>
<p>  He then bowed his head to Fran pleadingly. Looking at him like this, he couldn’t help but look like a pitiful adventurer who was falsely captured.  However, he was disgusting. Fran seemed to think so too. </p>
<p>「Then, I’ll take out your adventurer’s card」</p>
<p>「Eh?  No, I don’t have it with me now...」</p>
<p>「Then how did you plan to prove your identity in Alessa?」</p>
<p>「Y-You’re registered and your name and face are known by Alessa」</p>
<p>「?  I’ve never seen you though?」</p>
<p>「No, that’s not it...」</p>
<p>「Are you really Alessa’s adventurer?」</p>
<p>「Yes!」</p>
<p>「Then, why don’t you know about me?」</p>
<p>「... Kuh」</p>
<p>  She quickly fell apart!  It seems that she couldn’t disguise herself because she didn’t know much about adventurers. Anyone related to intelligence must have been investigating into the details, but this man was clearly a normal soldier. He was probably just in a hurry to be given the role of scout. However, that meant that there was a possibility that some group of people who wanted to know more about the area were hiding in this area.  So, what should we do with him?  It would be best to take him back to the town and interrogate him. However, that might help them escape to the enemy troops who might have entered the area.  If that was the case, it was faster to have him talk to us here.  Let’s do a quick check before leaving it to Urushi’sconfess poison.</p>
<p>「W-Why are you raising your sword?</p>
<p>「W-Why are you raising your sword? W-well, I’m your friend!」</p>
