</div><h1>Chapter 1050</h1><p>Fran was fighting a military-fitting girl named Marl, but her attack hand had slowed down when she saw her opponent wearing a slave collar.</p>
<p>The fact that she was a slave girl must have stimulated Fran’s trauma. Even if she was an opponent that could normally be defeated, she couldn’t win unless she attacked.</p>
<p>『He’s coming!』</p>
<p>The girl, who was running around in the sky using ice footholds and wind magic, unleashed her ice and snow magic at such a distance that even she was caught in it.</p>
<p>「Diamond Dust.」</p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>『That’s pretty powerful!』</p>
<p>Fran frowned coldly as she was blown away.</p>
<p>Being a magician must have improved the power of my magic even more. One shot probably shattered my barrier considerably.</p>
<p>The girl shot her magic even more consecutively. She must have used split thinking to keep casting multiple spells at a different time in this strategy where she kept casting her magic without pause.</p>
<p>I don’t think any real person should be able to withstand the intense pain...... But because he was being controlled, he seemed to be ignoring the pain.</p>
<p>And that’s not all.</p>
<p>「white smoke.」</p>
<p>『This is...!』</p>
<p>He seemed to have been aiming to fill the surroundings with cold air by firing a series ofdiamond dust. The white cold air restricted his field of view, and it was clearly increasing the power of his ice and snow magic.</p>
<p>『Fran! At this rate, we’re just wasting our time!』</p>
<p>(Nn......)</p>
<p>『If you can’t kill him, just stop moving. I’ll just shatter his limbs and make him unable to move!』</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>Seeing the burning town reminded her of the lack of time. Fran readied me with a pathetic expression. It would be best to paralyze me, but Marl had a resistance to abnormal conditions.</p>
<p>「Teyaaa!」</p>
<p>『I don’t have a grudge against you, but you’d better be quiet!』</p>
<p>Fran put her barrier at full power and stepped forward at once, deflecting her ice and snow magic. Even when she saw Fran jumping out of the white cold air that she could stand, her expression did not move at all.</p>
<p>He pulled out the slash at his waist with a sluggish movement and tried to catch it. But there was no way we could lose at this distance.</p>
<p>Fran flicked away Marl’s serber with her left back fist. She then slashed up her free right arm and slashed off her left leg in an arcuating trajectory, while not killing the momentum of her sword raise.</p>
<p>He didn’t seem to be feeling any pain, but as expected, he had lost his balance. He was trying to stop moving and regain his stance.</p>
<p>Fran threw a kick straight up at Marl and slammed it down toward the ship below. It was her evil left leg, imbued with the divine attribute.</p>
<p>Marl’s body plunged into the mast with tremendous force and broke. However, thanks to this, his momentum seemed to have been killed, and he was being thrown out without breaking through the deck.</p>
<p>She didn’t move, but she was unconscious?</p>
<p>『Alright, I’ll restrain you now! I wish the slave collar was at a level where I could overwrite it with my contract magic......』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>We could see a crew member running toward Marl, but they checked it with magic. However, the crew members still did not run away and were trying to get closer to him somehow.</p>
<p>「Hime-sama!」</p>
<p>「Save the Princess!」</p>
<p>She called Marl a princess. The broken mast has a snake-like emblem on it. Apparently, the small ship used to replace the damage was carried by people from the Sea of Sydran.</p>
<p>In other words, people in Seedrun had always been disposable from the start.</p>
<p>Fran’s face contorted, perhaps understanding this. She had a hunch that the Raydoss Kingdom was trying to harm them.</p>
<p>After blasting the crew members with magic, Fran landed on the deck and ran to Marl.</p>
<p>「Shit... Princess-sama...」</p>
<p>「I won’t let Princess Marl do it......!」</p>
<p>The crew members were still worried about their princesses, even though they were collapsing on deck. She must have been the daughter of a good queen if she hadn’t been controlled.</p>
<p>Maybe we could have made friends with Fran in different ways?</p>
<p>「Master, take out the collar――」</p>
<p>『Get back, Fran!』</p>
<p>As soon as she tried to restrain and release the collar, a huge amount of ice-based magic power was released from Marl. It instantly covered the deck and overflowed further into the surrounding area.</p>
<p>The surface of the sea froze, and the crew members who were worried about Marl had turned into ice statues.</p>
<p>「Guh... Ghaaaaah!」</p>
<p>『Regeneration? No, no, did you make limbs lost from the ice?』</p>
<p>Marl stood up with a high-pitched roar. His face had changed from a expressionless one from earlier to a stern one like an intimidating beast.</p>
<p>His body looked bigger not only because of his intimidation, but also because he had ice covering Marl’s body like a white ogre. It seemed that his lost arms and legs were also covered with ice.</p>
<p>They stood up, without any difficulty.</p>
<p>「Uuooourgh!」</p>
<p>My spell activation was instantaneous! Moreover, it had a wider range of effect than before.</p>
<p>Though still small, that was compared to the other ships. They were larger than those fishing boats as long as they were battle ships. In terms of size, they were about the size of a large cruiser on Earth.</p>
<p>The cold air emitted by Marl swallowed such a ship in an instant and froze the entire ship in white. She must not have been thinking about her comrades anymore.</p>
<p>Marle’s gaze was focused only on Fran.</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but be impressed by the change in the crew members who were worried about her. But maybe that was better for Marl.</p>
<p>「Grrrrr!」</p>
<p>「Teyaa!」</p>
<p>She dodged Marr’s blow as it hit me and Fran cut off his arm. Its strength was quite high due to its magical power, and my durability value was considerably reduced.</p>
<p>Even so, it was not enough to deflect Fran’s slash. Ahead of her from her right elbow, she was repelled and flew into the air. But now, Marle had completely quit being a human being.</p>
<p>「...It grew up right away」</p>
<p>『The feeling I felt now, I’m sure it sliced through my body as well. But I’m not just clad in ice. My body has also mutated』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>We’ll have no time to slow down when we get back from Gordicia!</p>
