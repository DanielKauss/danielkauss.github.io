</div><h1>Chapter 956</h1><p>「Kill this old man!」</p>
<p>「It hurts the uncle to say that he’s an old man. He’s not old enough yet」</p>
<p>「Shut up!」</p>
<p>The dragonkin who couldn’t stand Isario’s provocation attacked him at once. Even Isario, who didn’t remove Ignis, couldn’t tell he was a celebrity.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, they all attacked us. At first glance, we were in a pinch, but Isario waved his hand at Fran with an easy-going look on his face.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, okay? No, I guess, don’t overdo it.</p>
<p>『They might be under the command of the Dragon King. Let’s disable them and not kill them.』</p>
<p>(Got it.)</p>
<p>Fran nodded lightly as she held me up, but many of the dragonkin were on their way to Isario. She was probably angry at Isario for provoking them.</p>
<p>Fran restrained a few of them who had approached, and began to observe the battle from the other side. They didn’t even need to help, and they probably wanted to see Isario’s battle up close.</p>
<p>Isario continued his defense without a hitch, just like when he was fighting antidemons. His slamming smile seemed to irritate the opponent even more.</p>
<p>「Die! Dieee!」</p>
<p>「I’ll beat you up!」</p>
<p>「I’m not going to kill him, I’m just making a fuss about it. Young men would use strong words like that right away. But I’m not going to shout what I can’t do, okay?」</p>
<p>「What the hell is that?」</p>
<p>「Uwooooh!」</p>
<p>Even if he was treated as a small fry compared to Fran and Urushi, he was still a dragonkin, had high basic abilities, and was stronger than lesser antidemons. That must be why he got into a good shape.</p>
<p>Isario blocked all of these dragonkin’s onslaughts.</p>
<p>And so, the situation continued as if they were being attacked one-sidedly, but the end came in less than three minutes. One of the dragonkin suddenly lost his stance and collapsed.</p>
<p>「G-Gah......?」</p>
<p>He was breathing heavily, confused by his body because he hadn’t listened to what he had to say. It was too early for him to do so. The other dragonkin had collapsed as well, and were unable to move.</p>
<p>It was the same feeling as when I first saw him. However, this time I was able to see through his trickling immediately because I had predicted it myself.</p>
<p>Well, that’s pretty simple.</p>
<p>What she did was the same as what she had done in her antidemon battle. She increased the temperature inside her opponent’s body and inflicted damage to them.</p>
<p>However, the point was different this time. It was not so high as to burns, but rather that it was raised to a slightly lower temperature.</p>
<p>She then increased the temperature inside their bodies to deprive them of their strength. The dragonkin went on a rampage in a normally high-heated state, and in no time at all, they had exhausted their strength.</p>
<p>The dragonkin probably didn’t notice anything unusual because of their anger and excitement, and also because they had slightly increased their body heat.</p>
<p>This time, we only managed to increase the opponent’s body heat, but if we heat the air, it can burn the air in the respirator and damage the eyeballs. At first glance, this may look more simple than controlling fire, but this was a terrifying strategy.</p>
<p>「Have you noticed it by any chance?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Hahaha. That’s impressive. It’s difficult for uncles who use flames to catch them without hurting them. It was the result of trial and error」</p>
<p>Isario was the one who manipulated flames, so I guess they were created as needed. I guess I can’t escape from burns no matter how I control Ignis’ flames.</p>
<p>I bound the captured dragonkin and gathered them in one place. They had lost, but their hearts had not yet broken. Everyone was staring at us.</p>
<p>「Guess I can figure it out after trying it.」</p>
<p>「Guh...... I never talked!」</p>
<p>Seems like she has a lot of pride in herself, so she won’t talk straight enough to ask that. Fran then takes a step forward while holding me at the ready to interrogate us.</p>
<p>Isario reached out his hand lightly and stopped Fran. He must have been telling her to leave the decisions to him. Fran was clearly filled with killing intent, thinking that she was working for the Dragon King. She must have been worried that she might overdo it.</p>
<p>Fran also followed Isario’s words. She stopped and nodded lightly.</p>
<p>「Hahaha, you can’t stay that way」</p>
<p>「Shut up! Kill them!」</p>
<p>「Well, well, uncle. You must be impressed, right? No matter how many times his friends collapsed, he didn’t come towards us without fear」</p>
<p>「It’s only natural for a warrior」</p>
<p>Was they dragonkin warriors? I thought they were all missing a bunch of thugs.</p>
<p>「I’d expect as much from dragonkin, you know? Brave.」</p>
<p>「Hmph. Dragonkin are a warrior race after all.」</p>
<p>The dragonkin leader tilted his chest in confusion. Despite his bound limbs, he was still quite capable.</p>
<p>Isn’t they a bit too easy to deal with? But come to think of it, Isario was by far the most powerful. They praised him and didn’t think anything bad. I’m sure they were simple.</p>
<p>Isario must have seen the dragonkin’s attitude and decided that she could go all out. Then she persuaded them.</p>
<p>「I don’t want to kill these brave warriors if possible. Shall I just tell you one thing about me? That way, I won’t have to do anything rash as much as I need to.」</p>
<p>Isario showed no signs of hostility, rather speaking in a calm tone to the dragonkin. They were all at a loss for words after seeing Isario’s unexpected behavior.</p>
<p>「I don’t know who you’re from, but it’s not your real intention to die here, you know? But as I said before, we’re the official agents of the Adventurers Guild. If you just forgive anyone who attacked you, the guild itself will be mocked. You can’t do that. So, can you give us some information, even if it’s just for a little, okay?」</p>
<p>「......I guess you’re gonna let me tell you everything and kill her anyway!」</p>
<p>「That’s not what I do. I just don’t know what my partner is...」</p>
<p>Isario glanced at Fran. The dragonkin looked at Fran as if caught by her movements. Their faces were written what this little girl was really like. She was clearly licking her.</p>
<p>However, Isario shrugged his shoulders as if to see something terrifying, then lowered his tone of voice and spoke to the dragonkin.</p>
<p>「That young lady hates the illegal slavers, so she got a little excited after hearing that the dragonkin might be connected to the illegal slavers. That interrogation seems to be going to be a little harsh.」</p>
<p>So, Isario looked at Fran again. I could tell that she was clearly aiming for nothing and nothing. Isario was worried, and Fran was worried. So, I made Fran say a few words of threats.</p>
<p>「Illegal slavers...... I won’t forgive them.」</p>
<p>Fran muttered a line in her barrage as she swung me at him, but the killing intent released was real. The dragonkin must have sensed Fran’s seriousness.</p>
<p>His face was scrunched up.</p>
<p>「You guys too, don’t you think a child is going to mess with you like a game, right? That’s why you can’t spit out that much, right?」</p>
<p>「Minagoroshi」</p>
<p>「Urgh......」</p>
<p>「Come on, come on. I’ll make it in time for you now, okay?」</p>
<p>「First, I peel off all the scales and try to be smooth on your skin」</p>
<p>「Ahhhhh. You’re scared. So, what should we do?」</p>
<p>「Sh-she helps me if I talk to her?」</p>
<p>「Of course.」</p>
<p>Isario smirked with a disheveled look on his face. Then, the dragonkin was visibly relieved.</p>
<p>That’s how it ended up.</p>
