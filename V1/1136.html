</div><h1>Chapter 1136</h1><p>「Donad! Are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Indeed......」</p>
<p>He hurriedly used recovery magic on Donadrond, who had fallen down immediately after defeating Chardman. After all, the backlash must have been great. Even though his wounds were healed, he could not immediately stand up.</p>
<p>「The last one was amazing!」</p>
<p>「That is a technique where you return any damage you have taken so far to your opponent. If you cut my life even further, I felt that I could intuitively use it」</p>
<p>She seemed to have used the techniques she learned from mutating them in the actual battle. Moreover, it seems that she has to take more than a certain amount of damage to use them. It’s so audacious to try and kill them!</p>
<p>「I have so much to ask you, but...... Let’s help the nobles now.」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>I’m sure they were all wondering about how Fran and the others appeared here, what that ghouls were. But they were currently in a fight. So, they decided to postpone it.</p>
<p>Once again, she began to destroy the undead around her.</p>
<p>「Doraaaaaah!」</p>
<p>Donadrond’s axe easily cut the enemy undead in half. He was a decently strong opponent among the enemy’s undead.</p>
<p>At the very least, Donadrond would have had a rough time in the past. However, despite his great strain, he was now an easy win. His slashes were surprisingly bold and sharp.</p>
<p>「Donad is amazing!」</p>
<p>「Fuhahaha! It’s so full of power! I’m a little tired, but my muscles are rather strong!」</p>
<p>「Oooh―」</p>
<p>Donadrond shouted with “Hmph!” and showed us his ability to create a large amount of strength with a rough nose. His brawling biceps looked like a log.</p>
<p>Originally, they were muscular demonkin, but now that they had been further pumped up, they looked two larger. Fran was staring at Donadrond with sparkling eyes as he posed their figure looked strong.</p>
<p>He then began to pose on his own. Just like Donadrond, he was a Biseps guy. Well, Fran doesn’t have much muscle, so she looks like a punch.</p>
<p>Perhaps dissatisfied with that, Fran immediately stopped pose with a smug look on her face and slashed at the undead. She got a complete eight hits.</p>
<p>However, Donadrond and Fran’s efforts had further boosted the momentum of the surrounding adventurers, as well as the speed of their undead elimination.</p>
<p>Mareficent didn’t stand out much, but I could see how tremendous his support was. He was using provocation skills to draw enemy attention, while also putting up barriers and buffing the surrounding adventurers. In addition, he was also using debuffing to weaken their enemies, which was surprisingly all-powerful.</p>
<p>Persona did the same, using warding magic and ocean magic to support the adventurers.</p>
<p>Chardman, the enemy commander, was defeated, and the scavengers who created the undead, were all defeated by the ghouls. The enemy’s chain of command was already in tatters.</p>
<p>Even after Forrund and Urushi temporarily left, their stance was beginning to tilt toward us. The white light that Donad had already emitted had been cut off, but it was no longer a problem.</p>
<p>The number of enemies was steadily decreasing. It would be a problem if we could afford to take on more leeway.</p>
<p>「What is that undead?」</p>
<p>「I feel like I can feel the evil in it...」</p>
<p>「Seriously?!」</p>
<p>Those who felt evil were hearing more and more stories of how abnormal the Avengers were. Donadrond seemed to know too, and he seemed to be somewhat wary of Avengers.</p>
<p>It was unlikely that she could argue that it was just a undead.</p>
<p>Fran, who was using the ghouls that scattered such evil energy, was also looked at from a distance.</p>
<p>「Who are you!?」</p>
<p>It seemed that one of the surviving nobles had the ability to sense evil energy. An uneasy feeling must have exploded when a suspicious ghoul appeared where he was physically and mentally battered by the effects of the battle.</p>
<p>She pointed at her and shouted. Though she was not a nobleman who was very well-liked by others, the loud voice of her voice couldn’t be ridiculed.</p>
<p>Some of the soldiers, knights, and adventurers seemed to be starting to have doubts about Fran.</p>
<p>「I’m Fran, B-ranked adventurer」</p>
<p>「That undead! What could be that undead with an evil aura! T-You shouldn’t be an Evil Divine Adventurer!」</p>
<p>Well then, what should we do now? Mareficents and Aurel must feel completely stranger-like, and Donadrond must want to know what’s going on.</p>
<p>How do I explain it to him?</p>
<p>As I was wondering what to do, Fran moved first. For some reason, she stepped forward with a smug look on her face and held me high in the air.</p>
<p>「All of it was thanks to this sword」</p>
<p>「What? It’s indeed a very powerful magic sword, but...」</p>
<p>「This super amazing sword has the power to control and control Evil Spirits!」</p>
<p>「I-I’ve never even heard of that kind of power! Don’t lie to me!」</p>
<p>「Fufun. But it’s true. Other than that, there’s also something else, a Divine-ranked blacksmith, a super amazing sword!」</p>
<p>「Ooh! My priestess!」</p>
<p>「「「「...」」」」</p>
<p>Avengers knelt down, uttering a few words of their admiration for Fran. I guess they were trying to show that they were being manipulated...... Too much on purpose! I was just telling them to trust her now......</p>
<p>「C-could it be a Divine Sword?」</p>
<p>「No. But it was made by a divine blacksmith」</p>
<p>「Oh! What a surprise!」</p>
<p>Hmm? This nobleman believed me, wasn’t he? But he must have seen Fran’s fight before, and he should have seen that I was not just any magic sword. If that’s the case, is it surprisingly believable?</p>
<p>Besides, they might need someone to cling to whatever they want now that they had suffered a lot of damage from the enemy. Donadrond didn’t seem to think that Fran would lie, so he believed in her.</p>
<p>That’s when we got more reinforcements.</p>
<p>「I can vouch for it」</p>
<p>「Oh! Forrund-san! So, you’re safe!」</p>
<p>「Are you a Hundred Swords of Forrund?」</p>
<p>「Yeah」</p>
<p>It was Forrund who had returned with Urushi. Even if they looked down on adventurers, they would be treated differently if it was an A-ranked adventurer. Now that Forrund had assured us, the nobles and the others seemed to have calmed down somewhat like that swordsmanship.</p>
<p>My suspicions about Fran had almost disappeared. I was glad that we didn’t have to be treated as admirers of the Evil Gods in this enemy area. It was also a good thing that Avengers and Brunen didn’t fight back against adventurers when they attacked us and only defeated the undead after all.</p>
<p>(Hmm? What kind of magic!)</p>
<p>『It’s coming from a fort!』</p>
<p>It was also a brief moment when Avengers were accepted and relieved. A tremendous amount of magic power was emanating from the fort.</p>
<p>『She was the one who kept quiet after all!』</p>
