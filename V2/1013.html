</div><h1>Chapter 1013</h1><p>Immediately after Fran ran out to escape, there was a huge explosion behind her. Isario released his divine sword. </p>
<p>『In the end, you’d be counting on Isario to do this』</p>
<p>(Nn......)</p>
<p> Fran bit her lip. But she did not stop. She used all her strength to move and ran as fast as she could. She knew that getting out of here quickly would help Isario. No one chased after her. Trismegistus must have been attracted to her by Isario. Trismegistus must have been attracted to her by Isario.  However, it would have been much more difficult to talk to them anymore. Fran was probably still angry, and he said that he was going to destroy us as well. But it seems that if I were to be destroyed, the pieces of the Evil God would disappear against Fenrir-san.  At the very least, I didn’t expect them to be lies, and Trismegistus’ dragonkin power was tremendous. There was a high probability that they were right.  In other words, the part that might remain even if it was destroyed. I guess their goal was to create a system for strengthening and growth, similar to the dungeon system that the Goddess of Chaos created.  Juanaverta also said that he was jealous of the power to grow despite being a sword.  However, Fenrir-san has the power to grow me. Even if I can take it away, I don’t think it would be pointless... But is that not all she sees or has a different purpose?  While I was reflecting on Juanaverta’s words, Fran kept running and was heading out of the castle.  </p>
<p>(Just a little further to the exit!)</p>
<p>『Alright! If we just leave the castle’s territory at once――』</p>
<p>  We passed through the throne room and were just outside the castle.  Grah!  Her feet were trembling.  The ground was so strong that it looked as if the flooring had been misaligned. I thought that the impact of Isario’s battle had been conveyed to me, but it didn’t seem to be such a easy situation.  Unable to withstand the uncontrollable tremor, the floor and walls of the castle began to crack, and gradually it began to spread. The cracks on the floor, which were running through the shattered stone, were so deep that they almost took their feet off.  </p>
<p>『This is bad! It’s going to collapse!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  The crack was finally beginning to reach the ceiling, and pieces of stones of all sizes, big and small, began to rain and rain. The castle, which was protected by the power of the Gods and barely able to scratch with proper power, was about to collapse in an easy-going manner.  What I could feel from the basement of the castle was just the power of powerful antidemons.  The swelling presence was so strong that it made me wonder if my detection ability had been bugged. In terms of the size of the force, even Isario and Ashwrath when they used the Divine Sword Release were probably defeated.  Could they be the Abyss Eaters?  That’s what I thought.  Fran continued to move her feet in an attempt to chase after the rattling sound of the castle breaking. Then she jumped out.  </p>
<p>「We made it just in time!」</p>
<p>『The castle is...  Retreat!』</p>
<p>  As soon as Fran jumped back, a large amount of rubble fell on the spot.  It was just part of the stone wall that had one hand in it. And that was not the end. We could see the castle spire collapsing and falling down.  Fran moved further to avoid the rubble and distanced herself from the castle.  Looking at the whole castle, it was not the only thing that was affecting it. The entire hill where the castle stood had begun to tear and collapse.  Besides, the hill was clearly expanding.  It seemed to be being pushed up by strong forces from below. What was going on under this huge hill?  Sniff!  </p>
<p>『The ground is...!  Fran! Jump!』</p>
<p>  The slope of the hill had collapsed and major ground cracks were running in all directions. Just before she was swallowed by the deep crack, Fran jumped out of the hill at once with an aerial jump.  </p>
<p>「Something’s coming!」</p>
<p>『It’s so big!』</p>
<p>  Part of the castle exploded from the inside, creating a huge shadow. In terms of size, it would exceed the magic power of a giant-type antidemon. </p>
<p>「Red and golden... The one in the basement?」</p>
<p>『Surely, they have similar wavelengths of magic......』</p>
<p>  Not only the tone and magic, but they looked similar.  Could it be that the red-golden antidemons fighting in the basement had grown huge? The giant-type antidemons were probably experiments on creating this thing. The huge red-golden antidemons that stood up while dismantling the castle moved their shoulders and chests up and down as if they were taking a deep breath. A familiar loud laugh echoed as they stared up in dismay at the face of the antidemons far above.  </p>
<p>「Ahahahahahahahaha!  We’ve reached this far!  We can’t gather enough life force, and Overgrowth, who was supposed to be devoured, is gone too!  I never thought the plan would go this crazy, but the vessel was completed here! The birth of the strongest antidemons!」</p>
<p> The source of the explosion was the shoulders of a giant antidemon.  That’s where Mertritte was. A lorelei girl, who looked like a child of an elf, glared at us with a vicious look on her face.  It seems that antidemonization had progressed.  Some of her hands and faces have been transformed into antidemons.  </p>
<p>「I’ll always beat you up!」</p>
<p>「Mertritte!」</p>
<p>「Little girl!  Stay here and watch!  Do it all!」</p>
<p>  Immediately after Mertritte shouted so, the sun suddenly set.  A huge shadow then covered the earth. Looking up, we saw a sudden spread of purple color in the sky.  Did the barrier surrounding the castle discolored?  No, it was even higher.  The translucent purple dome covered a wide area. It’s a purple dome, not as big as the barrier covering the continent, but probably a few kilometers in diameter.  Was this Meritte’s doing? As we were puzzled, Meritte’s screeching voice rained down on us.  </p>
<p>「No one can escape anymore!  This antidemon will devour everything!」</p>
<p>「What do you mean?」</p>
<p>  Fran asked back as if to shout, but Meritte hadn’t seen Fran anymore. She was simply shouting as she glared at the earth in the distance.  </p>
<p>「Destroy them!  Ahahahaha!</p>
<p>「Destroy me! Ahahahaha! Let’s get started!」</p>
