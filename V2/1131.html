</div><h1>Chapter 1131</h1><p>The Genocide Ghouls suddenly began to revere Fran with </p>
<p>「My priestess!」</p>
<p>「...Are you going to obey me?」</p>
<p>「Of course! The Gods have ordered you to obey! I will obey any order! If you want to be destroyed, then let’s be destroyed!」</p>
<p>『I’m not lying』</p>
<p> It seemed that the revelation from the Evil God Fragment was truly oracled to these evil-minded beings. </p>
<p>「What are you?」</p>
<p>「I won’t let you die a worthless death」</p>
<p>「I do not wanna die a worthless death.」</p>
<p> Though they were a little tired to talk to, they continued their story with determination and succeeded in somehow drawing out the information.  The name of this ghoul was Avenger. He was said to be the trump card of the Black Skeleton Corps, created using Nameless the Black Skeleton Army and the special abilities of the undead known as the Saintess. It was an undead created by gathering thousands of grudges and was said to have been infused with evil spirits by the necromancy of the Evil God’s followers, the Woof throat.  The Mirenier Fort was actually not destroyed, but there was an evil research facility in its basement. The rumors had been spread to hide that fact.  However, they were attracted to the presence of Divine Power and came all the way here. Avenger’s mouth told us a story of the terrifying inner workings of the Kingdom of Raidos. I already knew that the Kingdom of Raidos had gathered illegal slaves, but their use was truly horrible.  First of all, the many illegal slaves bought by the Southern and Western Dukes were subjects of inhumane experiments.  Even if they survived afterwards, they were considered ritual sacrifices. The content of this ritual is said to range from the production of magic swords to the control of magic beasts. And death is not the end.And death was not the end.  And even that hatred of Raidos was used in the creation of undead and the generation of curses.  I could even feel a kind of obsession for the complete exhaustion of human beings.  It seemed that the source of this thought came from when Raidos was limited to adventurers. As a result of the various factors, such as war, hunger, and damage to magic beasts, the most excess resources of the Kingdom of Raidos at that time were people.  The Kingdom of Raidos assigns people who were wasteful and pushes them to exploit, develop, and increase their production.  Naturally, many people died like hot water, but the Kingdom of Raidos never stopped pouring people into the Kingdom. It was as if they were talkative, but surprisingly, there were few grief and resentment among the people.  Because it was a hegemonist country that had a national interest in external wars, many people were soldiers at the same time, and they were willing to go to the danger of death for the sake of the country.Because the country was supremacist with the goal of war against other countries, many of the people here were soldiers at the same time, and they volunteered to go to the danger zone for the sake of their country.  That was a kind of voluntary abandonment, but it was considered natural in Raydoss at that time, when brainwashing education was widespread during the war.In addition, it was only natural that soldiers who could no longer fight after losing their limbs volunteered themselves to various kinds of research experiments.  Such a tendency to consider people as inexpensive resources and excessive patriotism due to brainwashing education remained in the Raidos Kingdom for a long time, and gradually began to distort.Such a tendency to see people as inexpensive resources and the excessive patriotism created by brainwashing education remained in the Raidos Kingdom for a long time, and gradually began to distort.  What the people originally named themselves as servants to the country came to be understood as something that a nation should desire and deserve to die, and the psychological barrier to sacrificing people for the sake of the country’s interests itself has dropped considerably.And now, only the thoughts that were convenient for the Raidos Kingdom, such as allowing illegal slaves from other countries to be used for inhumane research, were left behind.  The reason why the hatred in Avenger’s tone was mixed with his hatred was probably because of the hatred in his tone.  Originally, Avengers were created with a grudge against Raidos as their base, and they had a grudge against Raidos Kingdom. However, both the saintess and the woof throat had taken control of him and made him slave without even doubting him. However, as their control was canceled by the pieces of the Evil God, their hatred for the Kingdom of Raidos seemed to have returned.  </p>
<p>「We were ordered to scatter poisons all over the Kingdom of Kranzel, but I don’t care anymore! On the contrary, let’s make sure Raydoss doesn’t rot!」</p>
<p>  Now that you mention it, these guys had the worst and best ability to use against war. They could move so quickly that ordinary adventurers could not catch up with them and splatter a large amount of super-powerful poisons. In addition, they had some dangerous poisons that could be chosen from a variety of poisons and render their plains and water sources unusable for several years.  Somehow, they were like destructive agents who could use an infinite number of deadly chemical weapons. A simple massacre could be no match for Nameless or even a Lich. It was said that it was the trump card of the counterattack that was created using almost all of the various resources that the Southern Duke had accumulated now that it was being counterattacked by the Kranzel Kingdom.  The Southern Duke’s trump card was bowing its head to Fran and was talking about its internal affairs. </p>
<p>「So, the Black Skeleton Corps doesn’t have much strength anymore?」</p>
<p>「Yes.  They still have the top brass, but they’ve allocated their forces to defend the various places」</p>
<p>「How many of their top brass are there?」</p>
<p>「First seat as the commander, Nameless as the “magician killer”, second seat </p>
<p>「Saintess」</p>
<p> ; Wickerman in the third seat </p>
<p>「Substitute」</p>
<p> ; iceman in the fourth seat </p>
<p>「Icemo」</p>
<p> ; Chardman in the fifth seat </p>
<p>「Black Burns」</p>
<p> ; and Hydman in the sixth seat </p>
<p>「Shade」</p>
<p>.  They also taught us about their abilities, but I guess the most interesting thing was about Hydman.  That infiltrating ability was troublesome. However, it seemed that it was not easy to find a suitable body, and as far as Avenger knew, there were only two more of them.  As we were asked about their inner workings, Avenger said a few words that he couldn’t miss.  </p>
<p>「If we’re going to target the top brass, we’re conducting our operations on the opposite side of that mountain.</p>
<p>「Haa!」</p>
