</div><h1>Chapter 954</h1><p>When Isario asked her why she had come to Gordisia, Fran gave an honest answer. </p>
<p>「I’m employed by the Kingdom of Belioth. But I really want to see Trismegistus. Also, visit a grave」</p>
<p>「Trismegistus? What should I do if I meet him?」</p>
<p>「Secrets. But I have to see him for sure」</p>
<p>「...I see」</p>
<p> It may sound suspicious, but he’s probably not trying to force us to ask. He shrugged his shoulders and let me go. But I will not forget the advice. But I will not forget the advice he gave me.  </p>
<p>「He is a monster.  It’s not a monster’s ability, but his spirit and existence. So, you’d better be prepared before you meet him」</p>
<p>「Your soul is a monster...?」</p>
<p>「I’ll find out when we meet him.  No, at first glance, you don’t know, right?  But that may be what it’s like to end up with someone who has been kept alive. At most, I’m going to make sure he doesn’t allow his ki to get away」</p>
<p>「Nn.  I’ll be careful」</p>
<p>  Fran replied, and Isario nodded in satisfaction. Somehow, they seemed to be taking good care of her.  </p>
<p>「You mean to visit a grave?」</p>
<p>「Visiting the graves of Mom and Dad. Both of them have died on this continent......」</p>
<p>  Fran told her about her situation.  She traveled with her parents as they were trying to evolve and settled down on this continent.  After a brief happy life, she was attacked by antidemons and enslaved. After Master saved her, she became strong and returned to this continent.  </p>
<p>「There are graves in Castel.」</p>
<p>「...... I see.」</p>
<p>  Isario muttered briefly and turned his head slightly. Then he bowed his head to Fran.  </p>
<p>「Sorry」</p>
<p>「What’s wrong?」</p>
<p>「I’ve heard something strange.  Besides, I guess you were making a foolish jealousy.」</p>
<p>「Jealousy?」</p>
<p>  Did jealousy really mean Isario?  On Fran’s side?  Fran and I couldn’t understand what was going on and put up doubts about it. I had never felt jealousy enough to need an apology from Isario.  </p>
<p>「... I’m just an ordinary person.  I don’t have any talent, and my thoughts are normal. I’m sure my 43 years of life is less than the decades or so that you’ve lived here」</p>
<p>「You’re a Rank S and you have a Divine Sword?」</p>
<p> Isario shrugged his shoulders with a self-mocking smile. </p>
<p>「A helpless man without talent is just revered by the Divine Sword」</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p> Isn’t he being too despiseful of himself? Fran didn’t seem to know what to say either.  </p>
<p>「When I first became an Adventurer, I was called without talent」</p>
<p>「A alias?」</p>
<p>「Despise. Yes, that’s exactly what it means to be a person without talent」</p>
<p> Isario was born in a remote, cold village.  It was a poor and harsh village, lacking food every day. There was no way he could use magic, and they honed their skills as swordsmen. That was all they had to do.  Besides, swords were respected in this world.  I guess it was from mythology, that the Sword God defeated the Evil God.  Weapons were, for now, swords. That was the way the people lived. Also, if that idea continued for many years, swords themselves would increase in number all over the world, and as a result, more and more people would teach them, and as a result, more and more swordsmen would follow.Also, if that thought continued for many years, swords themselves would increase all over the world, and as a result, more and more people would teach them.  As a result, there was a flow of swordsmen increasing in number.  Isario and the others at a young age did not leak out most of them, continuing their activities as low-ranking adventurers, holding a wooden sword or a rusty sword from goblins.  However, among his friends, Isario had no talent for swords. As his friends steadily increased their skill levels, only Isario’s skill level did not increase.  There was a sharp difference in talent between people. Even if they trained in the same way, there would be a difference in their skills and status.  Isario apparently didn’t have any talent for swords. However, they had no time to replace their weapons, so they had no choice but to keep on using their swords.  And when they finally had a little leeway, a moment came when adventurer ranks up.  Only Isario and his friends could rank up because of their inferior fundamentals. He was only weak because he had been forced to use weak weapons.  As a result, his friends dissolved their party with Isario.  They wanted to regroup with stronger adventurers to make more money.  Isario became angry, resented, and lamented. All he knew was how to live.  No, he would have had the option of returning to the village to help out with his field. But his small pride did not allow him to escape back to the village. He must have had some rebellious feelings as well as finding his friends.  He continued to work on low-ranked requests while continuing to hone his swordsmanship skills little by little.  His swordsmanship skills continued to rise at a slower pace than usual, but he continued to grow to 2-3, 4.  He had trained so hard that it was not surprising that he had reached the Sword Saint Skills... But he did not give up.  And Isario finally learned one part of his talent.  It was a talent for defense. His attacks were as bad as ever, but parrying and stopping using swords could sometimes show a sharpness that even exceeded his skill level.  Eventually, his skills, such as </p>
<p>『Receive』</p>
<p> , </p>
<p>「Drift」</p>
<p> , and </p>
<p>「Stop」</p>
<p> and he quickly dropped his swordsmanship level.  Perhaps he hadn’t been abandoned by his comrades if he had used it with his large shield or sword breaker. Even so, Isario loved swords.  He was so obsessed with them that he didn’t even know why he was here anymore.  When Isario finally became an E-ranker solo, I heard a rumor that his friend had become a C-ranker at a young age. Hearing the news, Isario understood.  It seemed that he was the only one without talent, and his friends were geniuses.  So, it was only natural that he couldn’t be in their party. With loneliness, frustration, and a slight feeling of blessing, I was finally convinced.  However, fate is truly mysterious and brutal.But fate is truly bizarre and brutal.  I’ve never heard of a Goddess in charge of fate, but I guess she’s definitely a prank-loving person.  One day, Isario met him in a corner of the flea market selling junk.  And for some reason, he was able to equip a mysterious magic sword, which no one had been able to equip, and was dusting it.  That was his encounter with the Divine Sword, Ignis.  Even Isario himself did not know why he was chosen. However, he was able to equip a Divine Sword and use its power.  Isario was the one without the talent, and Isario with the red lotus blade became an Isario, and so his adventurer rank went up to S at once.  Favor towards the wielder of the Divine Sword was apparently allowed by the Adventurers Guild’s rules. I guess it meant that they couldn’t just make a Divine Sword wielder a normal adventurer.  Suddenly, their positions rose, their eyes changed, and people returned their hands. At the same time, high-ranking requests came rushing in. Most of the requests were to exterminate high-ranking magic beasts that were unthinkable to fight, but they did not have much difficulty in accomplishing them.  Originally, they had a high defense technique that did not suit their rank.  What if the attack power of the Divine Sword was added to that?  No, in the first place, no defense was needed as long as we had a Divine Sword. People’s reactions were the same.  No one had seen Isario. They only wanted a Divine Sword user instead of an Isario. </p>
<p>「I was shocked to see my former friends again」</p>
<p>  Her eyes filled with dissatisfaction, jealousy, and desire, as well as her hostility towards him. The geniuses she once hated turned into mere small objects in front of the Divine Sword, and she could become a King just because she possessed a Divine Sword.  Realizing this ridiculousness, Isario stopped calling himself the name of the Red lotus Blade.  </p>
<p>『He’s without talent』</p>
<p>  That was the true form that he shouldn’t forget. That was why he continued to call himself stubborn.  </p>
<p>「I’m an Isario of no talent. It’s just that an ordinary person who’s only a little skilled at defense just happens to have a Divine Sword」</p>
<p>  That was why he was jealous of Fran, who seemed to have a natural talent that he didn’t have. He was a genius who had confidence in his abilities and was enjoying the present time when it was colored by the glorious past and future.  </p>
<p>「You see, I really don’t have a small vessel.  It’s just that I’m useless.  I can’t help but be jealous of myself and apologize to myself... Aah, I don’t like you anymore」</p>
<p>Isario looked up to the sky to ridicul her.</p>
