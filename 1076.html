</div><h1>Chapter 1076</h1><p>Satia let go of her hand holding Fran and wiped her eyes as she spoke about the future. </p>
<p>「Don’t you want us to be captured?」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p> I hesitated as well. To be honest, even if we gave Fran this and let her go, the villagers were still watching us for a lot. If the country were to check things out seriously, they would find out. But Fran shook her head as she said, </p>
<p>「We won’t catch them」</p>
<p>. If she wanted to catch them, she must have already moved on to action. </p>
<p>「I won’t catch you」</p>
<p>  That was what she said.  If she wanted to catch you, she must have already taken action.  </p>
<p>「I’ll come with you. In exchange, can I have your big brother take them back with me?」</p>
<p>「But that’s not going to end well for both Fran and Satia......」</p>
<p>「We can’t let our debtors go like this. Don’t worry, we’ll have to follow her from behind so that the people in the village won’t notice us.」</p>
<p>「...... Are you sure?  Don’t hide it?」</p>
<p>  Oops!  Fran, were you planning to hide it completely?  That was indeed nasty.  I have to report to her to some extent! You could be a national treason! </p>
<p>「Now that I think about it, I think it was Raidos’ aim」</p>
<p>「Raydoss’s aim?」</p>
<p>「Yes」</p>
<p>  Satia told me about her own plan, but it was similar to my one. I had been wondering about that for a long time, when she went all the way to capture a village in the Kranzel Kingdom and performed a large-scale ritual.  If someone told me that it was the only place where that was due to her dragon’s pulse, it would have been until then.  However, the Kingdom of Philias was surrounded by Raidos. Would it be enough to use a stronger curse on the Raidos Kingdom’s side? I didn’t know the specifics, but I felt that there was something other than the use of the curse.  </p>
<p>「I think Raidos’ aim is not just the completion of the curse」</p>
<p>「Do you mean it?」</p>
<p>  As long as the curse is completed, that’s fine. It will surely hit the Kingdom of Philias.  However, the Kingdom of Raidos was planning to have it stopped by the Kingdom of Philias, right?  In order to activate the curse, they could sacrifice the villagers, adventurers, and bandits gathered in the square to kill them. Satia felt as if the Kingdom of Raidos had purposely taken advantage of the people.In other words, the Kingdom of Philias was trying to attack a village on Kranzel’s side to stop the curse from starting.In other words, the Kingdom of Philias was trying to attack a village on Kranzel’s side to stop the curse from starting.  </p>
<p>「Our demon knights are a little too loyal to the country...」</p>
<p>  Some of them might even kill people from other countries without hesitation in order to save the people of the Kingdom of Philias.  Their original high loyalty could be distorted by the influence of the demons they possessed.  Demons have properties on the level of the Seven Dead, but Philias puts a heavy emphasis on demons of lust and arrogance. It was because they were easy to use as subordinates.  So, I’m sure Pune and Ronowe were demons from the legends of the Demon Lord... But are there even the Seven Dead?  Well, it was said that this world was created by the Gods based on Earth, so it might be a mixture of various legends. </p>
<p>「Arrogance will lead to their hard work if they don’t make a mistake in their direction.  Because they have a desire to be perfect」</p>
<p>  To look down on others, you need to improve yourself.  That trait must be useful in your work. It seems that lust was also decent if the opposite sex wasn’t intertwined, and Philias seemed to have a technique to suppress that trait. Rather than laziness and anger, I guess she’s more willing to listen to what she has to say.  When I thought back, I was convinced.  Because she looked down on others, there was the danger of doing anything. This was definitely the cause of Philias’ poor diplomacy.  Even if the only people sent were the demon knights instead of Franto and the others, they would have decided to kill them.Even if the only people sent were the demon knights instead of Frut and the others, they would have decided to kill them in the first place.  Then, if we somehow told Kranzel about that fact, the two countries would be in trouble.  </p>
<p>「It was a move to tear the two countries apart.  I think so」</p>
<p>「Then, it’s better to hide it」</p>
<p>「No, we’ll lose the trust of the Kranzel Kingdom when it comes to it later. The Raidos Kingdom will definitely try to get them to know after all」</p>
<p>「I see」</p>
<p>  I don’t know if the Raidos Kingdom’s aim was really there.  However, if Satia apologizes and reports to Kranzel, there is a high possibility that even Filurias will not decide to open a battlefield. That King was the type of person who moved with reason rather than emotion.  </p>
<p>「So, take me with you too」</p>
<p>「... Okay」</p>
<p>  Fran nodded her head, even though she was wondering.  But Satia suddenly braced herself.  She sensed the presence of someone approaching her at a tremendous speed. However, Fran smiled to reassure Satia.  </p>
<p>「Don’t worry.  I’m not your enemy」</p>
<p>  Immediately after Fran said that, a huge black body appeared from across the forest.  </p>
<p>「Arf!」</p>
<p>「Urushi!  That guy from earlier?」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  It was Urushi, who had returned.  He was holding a unconscious man in his mouth.  He was ready to bite her out at any time he tried to escape. He had skillfully captured the agent.  However, Urushi was also exhausted.  His magic power was less than half, and his life force was still decreasing. On closer inspection, I saw a small knife stuck in Urushi’s right stomach.  No, it looked small because it was Urushi’s huge body, just like the knife that took Fran’s life. Even though it didn’t have the effect of killing demons, curses could also be used on Urushi.  </p>
<p>「Urushi!  Are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Woof」</p>
<p>『Wait.  I’ll make it easier for you right away』</p>
<p>  Fran slammed a knife to kill demons and let me absorb it.  Even the slow-regenerating wounds due to the curse could be healed quickly by continuing to cast recovery magic with the Divine Attribute on it. If I used the curse recovery spell, the curses in my body would also disappear.  Did the man who was taken by Urushi make a dull sound?  The vibrations from slashing the knife caused a sharp pain and seemed to have put a little force into it.  I might have broken my bones, but I’m fine with that. The man had Pain Nullification.  </p>
<p>『Is this guy’s face like this?』</p>
<p>「Arf.」</p>
<p>『Yeah.  Did he change his face while he was in the village with illusion magic and disguise?』</p>
<p>「Arf.」</p>
<p>  Urushi nodded and slammed the man down.  He had lost one of his legs, but he had already stopped his bleeding. He must have used the potions Urushi had inflicted on him to block his wounds.  </p>
<p>「Oi.  Get up.」</p>
<p>「Okay......?  This place......  Tch!」</p>
<p>『Ah!  Poison!』</p>
<p>  The man who had awakened seemed to have immediately understood his situation.  He had swallowed the poison in his teeth. However, Urushi soon used his death poison magic to nullify the poison in the man’s mouth.  When he knew that he was not going to die, the man stopped moving with his mouth shut.  Because he was immune to pain, he didn’t even react to pain. Fran tried to hurt him and heal him, but it didn’t work for the man. </p>
<p>「What about this man?」</p>
<p>「...... Frut, the guy who threw the knife at you.」</p>
<p>「!」</p>
<p>  Fran hesitated a little, but she soon told him the reason.  Immediately after, Satia’s presence changed. I never thought I could unleash such a dense and vicious killing intent in such an instant...  Fran and Urushi were frozen in place.  It was not the kind of situation that Fran was afraid of, like a half-crazed cry. No, it may even be a terrifying situation.  </p>
<p>「...This is the way it is」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>  The moment Satia said </p>
<p>「This」</p>
<p>, even I felt a chill.  </p>
<p>「Hey, Fran-san.  Can you let me interrogate you?  I’ll make sure I’m open my mouth no matter what kind of hand I use. What do you think?」</p>
<p>「I-I think it’s okay.  Right, Urushi?」</p>
<p>「W-woof woof!」</p>
<p>  That Fran and Urushi were a little frightened.  Satia was that powerful right now. The man’s face was also contorted in fear as he looked up at Satia with a thin smile.I think it’s in our best interest for us to beat them all up as soon as possible.</p>
