</div><h1>Chapter 1104</h1><p>Fran left the mansion and immediately searched around for any intruders. </p>
<p>「......There’s a lot of people over there.」</p>
<p>『Those adventurers are said to be chasing after the undead.』</p>
<p> There was a presence of a large number of people moving around on the west side of the town. It wasn’t as if they were chasing after someone. They were probably still searching for them. As I was pondering how to move in front of the lord’s mansion, Fran and Urushi suddenly braced themselves. As I was pondering how to move in front of the lord’s mansion, Fran and Urushi suddenly braced themselves.  </p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>「Grrrr!」</p>
<p> I also immediately switched my thoughts so that my magic could shoot. </p>
<p>『 Someone was watching us just now』</p>
<p>(Nn, it’s the same way I felt outside of town)</p>
<p>『That gaze, huh...?』</p>
<p>  When I entered Alessa, I felt that gaze for a brief moment.  I was sure that it was the same person who was looking at us right now.  At first, I thought it was Klimut’s spirit, but it seems to be different. My spirit detection and Fran’s intuition are both different. </p>
<p>『But how are you going?』</p>
<p> The first gaze I felt was clearly from outside the town. If this belonged to an intruder, that would be strange.  After all, there must have been a commotion at that time that the undead had already entered the city. There were at least two enemies, the observer and the intruder, right?  But was it possible to monitor us from outside the town? No, I’m sure some of them could just watch, but wouldn’t it be impossible for us to not be identified where we were? We even failed to keep an eye on the spirits.  Anyway, we decided to move in the direction where we felt our gaze for a moment.  Leaving Urushi to move, Fran and I concentrated on our presence detection. We would focus on wide area detection while fully utilizing our magic and skills.  That was how we should have been looking for them, but we didn’t get any results.  From time to time, we would find suspicious presences, but they could be fire thieves or failed adventurers.  I’d put sanctions on them and tied them up and rolled them over. All we had to do was to catch them when the incident was over.  After a few more times, we sensed their gazes and moved toward the source of it, but as expected, our enemies were nowhere to be found. They would move right after they felt that we were being discovered.  </p>
<p>(Just like Esmeralda)</p>
<p>『What?  No, certainly』</p>
<p>  Fran was right.  If it was Esmeralda’s sand, they might be able to do the same. In other words, the enemy may be in a state where they manipulate something to keep an eye on it, and their main body is hidden. </p>
<p>(I feel like I’m being led in a different direction by letting them see me.)</p>
<p>『I-I see.』</p>
<p>  If they were an opponent with the same abilities as Esmeralda, then the point where there was nothing at the source of their gaze would go. That means that Fran was right.  Her eyes were bluffed and she was probably being led in the wrong direction.  </p>
<p>『Tch.  It might be more troublesome than expected.』</p>
<p>(Nn.  Do you want to do it?)</p>
<p>『Just wait a second.』</p>
<p>  I reconsidered my movements as I was led.  It seemed that we were walking on the east and south sides.  And on the west side, adventurers of Rank C and higher were gathered. They were probably being led by their gazes as well.  The rest was the north.  The northern part of the city, which was close to Raydoss, was heavily attacked by the undead, and many adventurers were gathered for defense. It was a place where adventurers tended to come and go outside of the walls to transfer supplies and injured people.  I unconsciously thought there was no such thing as that...  It might be able to hide right in the middle of a low-ranked adventurer’s head.  </p>
<p>『Looking for the north. </p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  We ignored our annoying gaze and started moving north at once.  There were so many people that it was quite difficult to find any sign of them.  If we wanted to hide the trees, we might have to go into the forest.  However, Fran and Urushi both had excellent senses.  They had sensed the suspicious presence in no time at all. In fact, since they had already experienced it, they seemed to have been able to find the suspicious place smoothly. As we headed to a place where Fran and Urushi felt suspicious, I understood too.  </p>
<p>『Fine...  It’s like we’re with Hydeman.』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p>(Woof!)</p>
<p>  It’s a feeling similar to that of Hydeman, the leader of the Black Skeleton Corps that we defeated at the royal capital, who specializes in stealth. I know they’re there, but I can’t find the source.  </p>
<p>『This is the warehouse.  Let’s shoot the purification magic first.』</p>
<p>「Okay!」</p>
<p>  And the same scene as the Royal Capital was repeated. This time, the only thing that happened was the Area Undead Return.  </p>
<p>「Nghuaaah!」</p>
<p>「Yes.」</p>
<p>『Haidman...?』</p>
<p>  Appraisal showed Hydman’s appearance, but he looked nothing like him.  He was a zombie much smaller than the Royal Capital, Hydman. His skills and status were a little different.  </p>
<p>「Little girl!  Another one, damn!」</p>
<p>『Another explosion!?』</p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>  The explosion device must have been triggered to prevent us from getting any information about him. Fran and I, like the royal capital, attacked Hydeman and prevented his explosion, but...  </p>
<p>「I didn’t get any information.」</p>
<p>『No, now I understand one thing.  It’s obvious that he knew Fran, so it’s not the information we were talking about. Apparently, it’s the same as the one in the Royal Capital, Hydeman.』</p>
<p>「I see.」</p>
<p>  Maybe they’re multiple and share their memories, or can they just swap their appearances and resurrect it? Anyway, I’m sure that Hydeman hasn’t been destroyed yet.  The stealth in that class is immortal, and it’s much more terrifying than a bad enemy...... Is the Royal Capital okay in the first place?  I’ll just have to look into Hydman’s body after he’s lost his head.  After all, robes are magic tools that give him stealth abilities.  Maybe he can mass-produce them. And there was also an item bag.  After all, the number of wielders was limited. We were not sure if we could open it out of exhaustion, but Fran seemed to want to go to the wall first.  </p>
<p>「Let’s go to everyone!」</p>
<p>『Yeah, let’s take care of the undead first.』</p>
