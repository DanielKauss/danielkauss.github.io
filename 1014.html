</div><h1>Chapter 1014</h1><p>Mertritte reached for the neck of the giant antidemon, with a cross-shaped magic sword stuck in it. </p>
<p>「Ahahahaha! I will take out all the yoke that binds you!」</p>
<p> I wondered if he was trying to manipulate the antidemons, but apparently not. Through the cross-shaped magic sword, I could see a magical connection between the antidemons and Mertritte. It seemed that their magic power was mixed in at once and was in sync with each other. </p>
<p>「!」</p>
<p>『Oioi...!』</p>
<p>『Oioi......!』</p>
<p>  Both Fran and I were surprised and stiff.  That was how surprised we were.  To our surprise, Meritte’s body sank into the giant antidemons.  But it was not just going to get inside the antidemons. He was clearly assimilating them. He was still laughing, even though his body was mixed in with the blood and flesh of the antidemons.  </p>
<p>「If only I could be happy! That’s not the value of being in a world like this!」</p>
<p>  The cries of Meritte as he spit out blood gave me despair and anger that cursed everything in the world. He said he was going to destroy the dragonkin, but his hatred now seemed to be much more than that.  </p>
<p>「I’ll take care of the restrictions that lock you up!  For that, I’ll give you everything I have!  Body, soul, and heart!  All of them!  So――So destroy them all!」</p>
<p> Leaving the cursed words behind, Meritte and the cross-shaped magic sword disappeared completely into the body of the giant antidemon.  Immediately afterward, the antidemons, who had originally been radiating tremendous power, began to show even more vicious presence.  It seems that magic power was coming from somewhere.  Where was the source of their magic power? It looked as if magic power was gushing out of nowhere and was poured into the giant antidemons.  </p>
<p>『I see! The Abyss Eater, huh!?』</p>
<p>  It seems that the Abyss Eater, which was filled within the barrier of this continent, was sending magic power to that giant antidemon. Doesn’t that mean it already has infinite magic power...?  When it appeared, I certainly thought it was strong, but it didn’t feel like it was the strongest. However, I realized that I was wrong when I saw it grow stronger by accumulating magic power.  It was already covered with so dense magic that it could cause a storm in the area, and the intimidation it emitted was flawless. If we were to get more magic power, we would really be unable to touch them.  What should we do?  Attack to block the supply of magic power?  But what can we do about that?  If it becomes a battle that stimulates us, we’re not the only ones who can handle it. The first thing we should do is to escape. </p>
<p>(Master, what about Isario?)</p>
<p>『To be honest, I don’t know.』</p>
<p>  The presence of antidemons was too great.  It would be difficult to find Isario alone, not to mention if he was in the Divine Sword Release state.  I didn’t think that Isario would die easily. But the fact that Meritte was doing everything she wanted to do like this means......  </p>
<p>「Uuaaaaaaaaaahhhh!」</p>
<p>「I’ve started to move.」</p>
<p>『Let’s get some distance!』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>  Immediately after Fran jumped back, a huge right fist of the antidemon was thrust into the place where she had been before. Her fist was about as big as a small house.  It was struck by the power of the giant antidemons.  The earth collapsed in a single blow, and the impact, as if a huge explosion had occurred, raged around the area. Fran, who should have been a few meters away, was even blown away by the strong wind.  Fran regrouped in the air and ran further into the sky toward the outside of the barrier.  Her remaining left arm stretched out.  Her movements were surprisingly fast. This was bad!  </p>
<p>『Fran! Behind her!』</p>
<p>「...!」</p>
<p>  Fran kicked in the air and avoided her huge palm in the nick of time. With only the slightest glare of her fingertip on the barrier, Fran was blown away by it with tremendous force.  </p>
<p>『Fran!  I’m going to heal you, so don’t stop!』</p>
<p>「I-Impossible!」</p>
<p>  She must have taken damage to the inside of the barrier due to the impact, and was spitting lightly in her blood.  Even so, Fran did not stop and used the flying momentum to escape from the giant antidemons. Fran was heading out of the barrier surrounding the castle, but she tilted her head.  </p>
<p>『Fran, what’s wrong?』</p>
<p>「...... The power may be sucked in?」</p>
<p>『What?』</p>
<p> I don’t feel anything, right?  But when I observed Fran, I was sure of it. It was really only a little, so I didn’t notice that Fran’s magic and life force was being sucked out.  From Fran’s point of view, which had high self-healing power, it was probably only a margin of error.  But it might be quite dangerous for a normal human being.  The absorber was a giant antidemon. So, they could absorb power from others even if they were already receiving it from the Abyss Eater, huh?  </p>
<p>「It getting bigger」</p>
<p>『What?  No, it certainly is...!』</p>
<p>  They seemed to be growing even more than they could have excess magic power from it. Wasn’t this really dangerous to leave it alone?  It was no longer an opponent that we could beat on our own. Realizing this, Fran ran off without even turning around.  She went down a hill and passed through the barrier of the castle.  However, an even larger antidemon was chasing after her. The tremendous breadth of their steps quickly closed the distance between them.  I mean, the antidemons in this castle are not supposed to be able to escape the barrier......?  But was she actually worried that she wouldn’t be able to leave the Sanatorium in the first place? It seems this was not just big.  </p>
<p>「Aaaaaaaaaaaahhh!」</p>
<p>『This is bad!』</p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>  The antidemon’s chest swelled for a moment, and then a tremendous loud voice rang out. In addition to the physical shockwave, the compressed magic power raged wildly and blew us away.  Thanks to the barrier, there was almost no damage, and Fran immediately recovered her stance.  However, with the slightest crap, the huge antidemon was rapidly closing in on her.  An antidemon’s huge arm was approaching in front of her. That would be difficult to avoid.  I tried to rebuild my barrier again to reduce the damage even a little.  It was not perfect since it was just right after it was destroyed, but it was better than not.  </p>
<p>『Shit!』</p>
<p>「Regression barrier!」</p>
<p> But just before the direct hit, a pale blue wall appeared between Fran and her huge arm.  Moreover, it didn’t stop the giant antidemon’s arm slightly. It was only for a moment, but it was enough for Fran to escape.  </p>
<p>「That was...」</p>
<p>I turned around to see a blonde girl standing a short distance away.</p>
