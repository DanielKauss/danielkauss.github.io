</div><h1>Chapter 1124</h1><p>Three days have passed since Fran’s Bootcamp continued, and the valiant warriors had been transformed into amazingly serious people. They moved with a tingle, worked together with their friends, and at the end of the day, they ate the curry and talked about the wonders of their work. They had already returned the carriage, but their escort was in a perfect state. Originally, there were no problems with their abilities. As their personality had improved, I didn’t feel uneasy. It may not sound like they were a little brainwashed, but it was better than being captured by Mareficent. It may not sound like she was a little brainwashed, but it’s better than being captured by Mareficent.  Actually, at the end of the second day, Mareficent had revealed the truth to us.  The beginning of the incident was that Fran had noticed the presence of a spirit.  At night, Fran suddenly looked around to see the surroundings. There was no sign of any magic beast, and her eyes were not on the soldiers or Mareficents. For some reason, she was wandering around an empty sky.  </p>
<p>『What happened?』</p>
<p>(The spirits are there)</p>
<p>『What?』</p>
<p>(There’s a lot of them)</p>
<p>  It seemed that several spirits were floating around. I couldn’t feel any sign of them, but I thought of a way to find them.  I activated my Spirit Hand and tried to expand it around me along with my telekinesis. As I did so, I felt a slight touch of something. The moment I touched it, I ran away with a surprised look, but I was sure that there was a spirit that I couldn’t see and couldn’t feel. I wonder if there were at least five or six of them. </p>
<p>(I know this presence)</p>
<p>『What?』</p>
<p>(Klimut’s water spirit and the wind spirit)</p>
<p> Before she knew it, Fran was able to sense the difference between the spirits.  When she said that it was Klimut’s spirit, does that mean that she was secretly escorted by her? Or is he a guard?  </p>
<p>『I guess this request isn’t just the transportation of supplies after all』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p>  Come to think of it, the quality of the warriors was poor.  Even though they were capable, the warriors at the time they joined up were far too bad to be true. Just as Fran thought, they were all sure that they would get in the way of their allies when they fight on the front lines.  Moreover, our guide was Rank A.  I couldn’t help but feel something was off. As I was wondering what to do while staring at the spirits, I saw Mareficent’s group approaching. </p>
<p>「Did you notice that feeling?」</p>
<p>「... There are a lot of spirits in there」</p>
<p>「Did you have the talent to see spirits!  Did you know that, Klimut-san?  You know that, don’t you?」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>「Klimut-san is already soft on children!」</p>
<p>「Is there something about this request? It’s strange that you’re coming with us on a quest like this」</p>
<p>「Did you know that?」</p>
<p> Mareficent raised his hands and lamented, with a wry smile on his mouth.  </p>
<p>「Hah. What do you think, Persona?」</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>  Persona thrust her fist out and thumbed up at Mareficent’s words.  </p>
<p>「You’re saying that, aren’t you?  I can’t blame you if you keep an eye out on us. Worst case scenario, I’ve been told that I could tell you」</p>
<p>「So, did Mareficent have a special mission?」</p>
<p>「Yes」</p>
<p>  Fran also sat down as Mareficent urged her to sit down. I guess it was a long time. </p>
<p>「The first thing that happened was that your rank-up request was from the government, wasn’t it?」</p>
<p>「From the country?  The Kranzel Kingdom?」</p>
<p>「Yes.  With Rank A, it’s easier for them to accept requests from the government, and above all, the creation of new strong people is an influence that can’t be ignored during the war. Did you complete a request for national relations?」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>「That’s why the government judged that you were worthy of Rank A. Well, the decision will be made by the guild, but it seems that the guilds in various places have gained support one after another」</p>
<p>「Is that so?」</p>
<p>It was no good before, wasn’t it?  However, the situation seemed to have changed.  Originally, she had been recommended as a rank-up. In addition, she had been a big help in the war this time.  In addition, the reports from the Gordicia and Belioth branches, which were a little behind, were raised, and the wind direction suddenly changed.  </p>
<p>「They told me that it might be a good idea to promote Black Lightning Princess-dono with such an active person. So, we have decided to conduct the rank-up exam as soon as possible...」</p>
<p> The rank-up test for Rank A adventurers was apparently about assigning them a more difficult mission and seeing how they can overcome it.  </p>
<p>「Klimut-san must have been the one who took the most out of this time」</p>
<p> For this transportation mission, Klimut was preparing 200 ordinary brave soldiers and 20 ordinary carriages.  However, the upper management of the Adventurer’s Guild interrupted us. The guild probably thought that it was just right for the rank-up test. The details have been changed and the special transport mission that Mareficent was supposed to be in charge of will be used for Fran’s test.  Klimut was still early to rank up, which was so resisting that it was a problem for the upper management of the guild. However, it seemed that he could not overturn the decision of the guild headquarters.  From Klimut’s point of view, Fran trusted him to tell them about me, but soon after, he would do the rank-up exam like a trick.  As a serious person, he must not have been able to accept it. Moreover, he was a full-fledged rank-up who wanted to use Fran, a child, for war.  So, I’ll tell him not to worry about it when he gets back.  And Mareficent would be placed as both a guide and an examiner and accompany him on the mission. In addition, Mareficent was also said to be on the original special transportation mission.  </p>
<p>「What is that mission?」</p>
<p>「It’s similar to what Black Lightning Princess-dono is doing right now. Those who find out the root of the bad behavior of the volunteer soldiers and decide that they have a problem using it as it is are supposed to be separated and re-educated by me and Persona」</p>
<p> In other words, they are conducting both Fran’s rank-up test and the bad behavior adventurer’s test at the same time.  </p>
<p>「Klimut-san insisted.  It’s too tough for a solo adventurer to be able to suddenly force the leader of the bad behavior without even knowing the true contents. She said that she would bring the spirit with her just in case」</p>
<p>  Mareficent stared into the void.  He seemed to be able to see spirits as well.  </p>
<p>「I never thought I’d send so many spirits, but...  I’m sure they’re also there to warn Black Lightning Princess-dono.  It’s fine for the guild to not offend Klimut-san though. It’s not enough for me to be in between them」</p>
<p>  Mareficent smiled wearily.  </p>
<p>「Klimut-san, aren’t you going to be able to regain your old strength and become a Rank S anymore?Mareficent stared into the void. He seemed to be able to see spirits as well. </p>
<p>「I never thought I’d send so many spirits, but... I guess it’s also my goal to warn Black Lightning Princess-dono. The guild can do whatever it takes to get Klimut-san angry though. It’s not enough for me to be in between them」</p>
<p> Mareficent smiled wearily. </p>
<p>「Klimut-san, aren’t you going to be able to regain your old strength and become a Rank S anymore? I’m the one who’s at the brunt of it all...」</p>
