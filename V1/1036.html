</div><h1>Chapter 1036</h1><p>『It’s not just me that has changed, you know? Fran and Urushi, you’ve both leveled up too』</p>
<p>(Oooh!)</p>
<p>(Woof!)</p>
<p>So many fierce battles, so many strong opponents. I wondered if only one of them ever got up, but after fighting in large numbers, Fran’s level rose to over 70%.</p>
<p>In fact, an ordinary low-level, medium-level antidemon would have tens of thousands――no, maybe even hundreds of thousands of experience value.</p>
<p>In fact, when we heard about the adventurers around us, we found that many of them had leveled up more than 10.</p>
<p>It would take a terrifying amount of experience for Fran to level up in the future. Besides, the quality of her enemies might be important too.</p>
<p>With a mere goblin, I didn’t know how much I had to defeat. There was even a possibility that I wouldn’t get any experience.</p>
<p>In the future, it might be more important for her to hone her skills than her level. In fact, it was not only the level that Fran gained this time.</p>
<p>Not to mention the blessings of the Beast and Insect Gods. I have acquired several skills that are difficult to obtain in a short period of time, such as fear resistance, patience, sleep resistance, regeneration, and perseverance, that require me to put myself in an extraordinary situation.</p>
<p>Of course, the battle on this continent was not the only reason. The various fierce battles that had occurred since Fran met me had given her these skills.</p>
<p>Also, skills such as distance learning, kicking skills, morale boost, and equilibria were skills that I have lived up to. My blinking skills had reached the max level, and now I have developed a higher-level skill called ‘Sudden Movement’. My agility has been sharpened.</p>
<p>The increase in stats was probably not as huge as it was when she increased her stats from 69 to 70%. I guess that was the result of the combination of the effects of the Divine Beast Transformation and the bonus at a good level of kiri.</p>
<p>Still, HP and MP stats increased by more than 100, and agility increased by about 70%. Thanks to that, our stats exceeded 1,000.</p>
<p>All of our other stats had grown by about 30~40.</p>
<p>Like I thought, after all, the increase in status from the level of ‘70 increased without a hitch, and she seems to be able to become stronger rapidly. It would be quite difficult to raise the level though.</p>
<p>She also received a title, “Substantial Beasts of the Divine Beast”.</p>
<p>It is said to be a title given to those who were able to sense the blood of a Divine Beast flowing through their body. Was it manifested by manipulating the Divine Attribute with the help of the Beast and Insect God’s blessings?</p>
<p>The effect was rather vague, as it strengthened her instinct as a Divine Beast. I didn’t quite understand what it was, but it might be a trigger for her to become a Divine Beast.</p>
<p>「At any rate, we need to take her to a place where she can rest. What do you think?」</p>
<p>That means that the various people we’ve seen in the past may not actually have some of the most important skills or titles. Can they be seen now?</p>
<p>Urushi was also at the level of 61, and his stats had increased to more than Fran. I guess this was probably because he was a magic beast. His HP had increased by 250 now.</p>
<p>Compared to her stats, her skills weren’t much improved. Unlike normal humans, she probably didn’t learn many skills.</p>
<p>If we lose to a magic beast in terms of skills and status, humans will perish in no time at all.</p>
<p>However, she still had the skills for hauling and fortitude. Maybe it was because she transported so many people? The reason for her indomitableness was probably because she had experienced a tough battle like Fran’s.</p>
<p>『But I guess both of you are at level 61』</p>
<p>This would be on the same level as the Beast King we had appraised when we first met. In Fran’s case, her stats were evenly matched. On the contrary, Amanda’s stats completely exceeded hers. Is it a race difference?</p>
<p>Well, considering that we didn’t see any titles, I don’t know how reliable that level or status is.</p>
<p>Still, there was no doubt that Fran had approached the world of the strongest forces one step closer.</p>
<p>It was thanks to Fran’s efforts that I was able to reach this level in such a short time. I would admit that my power was great. But no matter how strong I was, it was Fran who wielded it.</p>
<p>The current result was only possible because of Fran’s hard work.</p>
<p>But there was one more thing I was concerned about. It was her skill.</p>
<p>Even though he was physically lined up against Beast King Rigdis (probably), that was only a matter of numbers.</p>
<p>The only problem was that he was inferior in terms of skills and had completely lost in terms of experience.</p>
<p>Rigdis was the King of the Spears, a skilled magician, and a experienced hero. Both Fran and I have not gone that far yet. If we fought head-on, we would easily lose.</p>
<p>Would it be in Fran’s best interest to praise him for standing in line with the Beast King now? Or would it be in Fran’s best interest to warn him that he was not done yet?</p>
<p>(Master?)</p>
<p>『Yeah. I also thought that Fran’s level was on par with the Beast King’s.』</p>
<p>(Hmm?)</p>
<p>When I said that, Fran frowned.</p>
<p>『What’s wrong?』</p>
<p>(Even if they are at the same level, they will lose at all. They won’t be happy)</p>
<p>(Woof.)</p>
<p>『No no no, I’m just equal in stats, right?』</p>
<p>(That’s not good. I could fight with Master. But I can’t win on my own. I’ve lost both my skills and experience)</p>
<p>Fran seemed to share the same sentiment as me. She had an expression of frustration on her face.</p>
<p>(Even if the level of their skill rises, they don’t. They’re just like nobles raising their power level)</p>
<p>The Beast King has been fighting for decades, so it’s no wonder he’s losing. He said one day that he’ll be able to catch up with him.</p>
<p>(Nn. I’ll do my best.)</p>
<p>(Woof!)</p>
<p>(I’ll do my best!)</p>
<p>(Woof woof!)</p>
<p>There was no way Fran and Urushi could become a Tengu just by getting a little stronger. Rather, they were so strong that I had to worry about not pushing themselves too hard.</p>
