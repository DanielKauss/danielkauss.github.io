</div><h1>Chapter 962</h1><p>We, in coordination with the adventurers, succeeded in destroying the antidemons that were swarming around Brutori. However, there was still a big one left. They called out a blurry voice to Fran as she landed next to Isario, who had removed the flames.But there was still a big one left.  Isario shrugged lightly as Fran landed next to the Isario who had put out the flames, and he whispered to her.Isario shrugged lightly.  </p>
<p>「Well, uncle is not complaining if he can enjoy it.  Besides, he’s still too close to town.  You want to go, right? </p>
<p>「Nn!  Then please do your best!」</p>
<p>  It would be quite risky for Isario to use the Divine Sword Release twice in one day.  Not only would it lower his level, but the backlash must be considerable.  Besides, Isario was right close to the town too. It would be a bit troublesome for Isario to control it so as not to cause any damage.  It’s fine as long as Fran can defeat it. If she had inflicted any damage, Isario might be able to put a stop to it without using the Divine Sword Release.  At the very least, I decided that I would not let it go bad if I left it to Fran.At the very least, I decided that I would leave the rest to Fran.  </p>
<p>(Master, I’ll do it!)</p>
<p>『Yeah, you’re right.  We can’t just rely on Isario for everything we’ve done.  </p>
<p>(Nn!  If I’ve used the Divine Sword many times, I’m sure Isario will be in danger)</p>
<p>  Fran knew that Isario was not at full power.  I was hiding it well, but there was definitely a backlash.  It’s not like we’ve healed the exhaustion from the fierce battles we’ve fought on this continent.  But it was much better than Isario now. It healed considerably while Fran was asleep.  </p>
<p>『Weak attacks might be blocked by that sheepish water back.  It still contains a lot of magic power.</p>
<p>「Nn.  Okay.  Fran nodded with a look of determination and carried me on her shoulder.  Then, she glanced back at the adventurers and Isario who were standing in line to watch over Fran.  But Fran was not the only one who was worried about her.  </p>
<p>『Fran, what’s wrong?』</p>
<p>(A lot of them were dead)</p>
<p>『...  Well, that’s why... Umm?)</p>
<p>  What Fran was watching was the adventurers who were sleeping at the city gate and beyond.  The adventurers who will never get up again.  In the past, Fran only thought of many other adventurers as her peer. She probably didn’t have a strong feeling about them as a friend. However, as a result of fighting, singing, and enjoying the party with the adventurers, she seemed to have developed a sense of camaraderie for adventurers.However, as a result of fighting, singing, and enjoying the party with the adventurers, they seemed to have developed a sense of camaraderie toward adventurers.  And the death of many of these adventurers seemed to have created a strange feeling about them in Fran.  Fran herself didn’t seem to know why she felt that way herself.  She tilted her head because she couldn’t put her feelings into words. But she didn’t seem to feel uncomfortable.  After staring at the huge antidemons again, she seemed to have regained her courage.  </p>
<p>(...I’ll protect this town!)</p>
<p>『Yeah, let’s see.』</p>
<p>  Fran slowly kneaded the magic power as she walked towards the huge antidemon. It was not that she had enough time, but it was not that she was in a hurry to doom in a few minutes.  She had enough time to slowly build up her power and prepare for a serious blow.  I also focus my magic power on it, just like Fran.  Antidemons spring up from time to time around Fran, who walked slowly. However, the antidemons that appeared were instantly killed by the flames that launched from behind immediately after they showed up.  It was the strongest support I had ever received.  No rear guard would be so relieved.  </p>
<p>「Phew......  Haa......」</p>
<p>  Fran continued to walk in the same pace without disrupting the antidemon’s presence. Her breathing became deeper and deeper, and each time her magic power increased unusually inside.  Yet, there was no magic leaking out of her mouth. It was a sign that she was able to concentrate her magic power completely without wasting any time.  When the distance from the giant antidemon was close to 100 meters, I teleported Fran. It was because I wanted Fran to do that.  Fran began to fall as soon as she teleported. With the orange sun starting to lower its altitude slightly, she was looking at the huge antidemons directly below her with sharp eyes.  </p>
<p>「Awakening, Brilliant Lightning Rush...  Urushi!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「You’re still tired?」</p>
<p>「Woof!  Then lend me your strength!  Urushi was feeling fatigue all over his body, but he seemed to have recovered to the extent that he could swing his paw. Fran and Urushi jumped up in the air and synchronize their timing with Aun’s breathing.  Gulluh!  Haaah!」</p>
<p>  Urushi’s paw knocked Fran down. Wolf-Style Sword Drawing Technique.  Fran accelerated from the cold air into the giant antidemons. For a moment, my blade was covered with black lightning.  It was black lightning, imbued with a faint Divine Power.  It wasn’t just given to me.  I could see that the focused black lightning was mixed with my magic power to increase my offensive power. </p>
<p>「Black Lightning God’s Claw!」</p>
<p> It’s one of the most difficult techniques of the Black Lightning God’s Claws!  It’s one of the most powerful attacks that Fran uses, combining a Wolf-Style Sword Drawing Technique and a Black Lightning God’s Claw. If it was successful.  Haaah!  With a sharp exhalation and a slash―― Don!  At the same time, the huge amount of black lightning that was released burned my entire body.  The tremendous heat of the amniot that had enveloped the giant antidemons evaporated in an instant. The white mist that drifted around it.  Is it okay to inhale this? I’ll just cover the area with a wind barrier. The impact of the black lightning knocked the body of the giant antidemon in half, falling to the left and right. Fran, who had landed a little farther away from me, moaned frustratedly at the fact that she fell on one knee.  I could still feel a slight amount of magic power in the giant antidemon’s body. The cut section slowly rose.  Even our best attack had not been able to defeat the giant antidemons. No, we might have defeated them if it was as powerful as we had expected.  However, the control of the Black Lightning God’s Claws had become slightly sweeter at the moment it was unleashed, and the power of the slash had decreased. We had worn down the giant antidemons quite a bit, but they were still trying to regenerate it.  However, Fran and I were still sad, not worried about it.  Clang!  I could see countless flames pouring down on the giant antidemons in front of us. We did not manage to achieve our goal of defeating them, but we had completed our minimal role of reducing Isario’s burden.  The divine sword showed no sign of life.  We must have decided that we could no longer release it.But Fran and I were both sad, not worried about it. Clang! In front of us, we saw countless flames raining down on the giant antidemons.

We must have decided that we could no longer release it. As a result, the red flames burned down the huge antidemons that had been cut down and turned into ashes.</p>
