</div><h1>Chapter 1097</h1><p>When Fran was hired by Esmeralda, she immediately set out for a nobleman’s mansion on the list. We were going with about 30 soldiers, Count Bailleys, and a maid. They had already changed to the same equipment as the other soldiers, so they were no longer maids.</p>
<p>She was one of the main players in the dark, her name was Blue. Well, it seems she was a pseudonym, but it seemed she was something like a code name.</p>
<p>Fran was also wearing a mask and was ready. Esmeralda said that she couldn’t remember her face anymore, but to be more precise, she felt that it didn’t leave a lasting impression on her. She said that even if the other party tried to remember her later, they would only remember that she was a beastman woman.</p>
<p>It was said to be a high-level magic tool that Esmeralda had found in the dungeon. She lent it to us briefly, but it was quite a valuable item.</p>
<p>Esmeralda was not there. She was waiting for her at the royal castle, probably because she was also in charge of the other execution troops.</p>
<p>I don’t think it was a coincidence that Count Bailleys came with Fran. He was chosen to accompany her as her support because he was an acquaintance. But it was also convenient for us.</p>
<p>She wanted to somehow tell them about the situation with Velmeria and Tilanaria. In the castle, it didn’t go well because of the eyes of others.</p>
<p>I’ll make it successful this time!</p>
<p>Well, what we did was simple though.</p>
<p>「Hey, are you a knight now? A soldier?」</p>
<p>「Hmm? Oh, that’s it. He was a guard knight now, but he was pretending to be a soldier this time. That’s because it won’t stand out. This is pretty common for our guard knights since they can do various jobs other than guarding the king」</p>
<p>「Hee―」</p>
<p>Kin of Swords, Kin of the Wolf God, The Lonely Beast, The Predator of the Evil, The One and Only. But this is the first time I’ve seen something like this in the world.</p>
<p>「I was on the continent of Gordicia.」</p>
<p>「Oh! Is that so?」</p>
<p>Obviously, Count Bailleys looked interested. But we didn’t miss out on the momentary concern for Blue.</p>
<p>Like I thought, they somehow knew where Velmeria was. But I couldn’t say exactly where she was.</p>
<p>「We met Tilanaria」</p>
<p>「I see. Aah, I’m just on a mission now. It’s better not to talk too privately」</p>
<p>She thought that Fran might be able to talk about Velmeria with the same momentum as before. Well, I guess Fran would be able to talk straight to her though.</p>
<p>You don’t have to worry, she’s just following my instructions.</p>
<p>「Tilanaria, you’ve been through a lot, but now she’s living a happy life」</p>
<p>「Is that so?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Just like any other dragonkin or his younger brother.」</p>
<p>「!! I see!」</p>
<p>Thank goodness, even Fran’s super-bold line of reading had conveyed it to me. Frederick, who was also Velmeria’s education staff under the Count’s command. The Count knew that her love was directed at Velmeria and that she should be with her now.</p>
<p>And he was actually his big sis with Tilanaria, the Count’s beloved miance, and uncle to Velmeria. Since he became an evil dragonkin, he must have refrained from talking openly.</p>
<p>But there was no way the Count himself did not know. In other words, the fact that Tilanaria was with her younger brother meant that Velmeria, who was accompanying her, should be with her.</p>
<p>That was what I should have felt.</p>
<p>The only problem was that Blue was clearly suspicious of him. After all, Fran was looking for him, and the count was suspicious of his behavior. Since he was in the dark, he was probably looking for Velmeria’s whereabouts, so I wonder?</p>
<p>「Blue, what’s wrong?」</p>
<p>「No, it’s nothing. I’ve been told to leave the private part of Countess aside. I’ll just do what I didn’t ask for」</p>
<p>She didn’t lie. Apparently, the King had told her not to follow Velmeria anymore.</p>
<p>Ostensibly, they were putting in a bounty, but I guess they can’t put in the effort to track it down.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we arrived at our destination.</p>
<p>「I see it」</p>
<p>「Is that Viscount Ozelo’s mansion?」</p>
<p>「Yes. If you don’t want to go in first, you can use force.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Blue looked somewhat complicated. I guess she was also opposed to going for a hardline assault. However, it reminded her of the killing intent that Esmeralda had unleashed, and she didn’t seem to voice her disagreement.</p>
<p>「Tell me what you know about your slaves. Everything. There is no other way for you to survive.」</p>
<p>「Thank you very much for your cooperation.」</p>
<p>「Okay! Come on, let’s go!」</p>
<p>「Yes!」</p>
<p>Counts and soldiers responded to Blue’s voice. These were grown men who looked as if they were ready to take orders from a woman and a little girl under normal circumstances.</p>
<p>However, they seemed to be well aware of the dark side of things, and followed Blue’s words.</p>
<p>From this point on, Fran and Blue acted like subordinates to the Chief Soldier disguised as Count Bailleys. The sole reason they acted was to make sure that the soldiers were the main ones.</p>
<p>If they were willing to obey the order to the very end, then they should think of it as white. We have a good search order too. Since we were soldiers, we tried to put up an order properly or showed signs of eliminating them, but it was Fran and Blue’s turn.</p>
<p>Count Hilt then asked the gatekeeper of the Viscount Ozelo’s mansion to take care of the miscellaneous tasks. But those people here were way too dang low to have the right to refuse us.</p>
<p>The only problem would be after this.</p>
<p>After waiting for a few minutes, we saw a large number of soldiers running toward the gate from inside the mansion. It was clearly in a battle-ready position. Then, the most important person shouted in a pompous manner.</p>
<p>「Where are you thinking about this? Viscount Ozeloss-sama’s mansion! Was this a soldier’s on-campus investigation? Don’t make him laugh!」</p>
<p>「But we have an official writ of war here」</p>
<p>「Don’t talk like you! Bring someone higher up!」</p>
<p>The count still pretended to be a soldier. He probably didn’t want anyone to know that his guards were active as much as possible.</p>
<p>However, the soldier over there was completely underestimating us. No, I’d say he was at least acting half the time. He seemed to be ordered to buy some time.</p>
<p>A large number of people suddenly started to move around in the mansion. I didn’t know if there were any spies from Raidos, but I was sure that they were suspicious of us.</p>
<p>「Understood」</p>
<p>「All I have to do is know! Go home!」</p>
<p>「No, it was just that I told you I didn’t want to obey」</p>
<p>The count then drew his sword and held it at the ready.</p>
<p>「I-Impossible! T-You bastards! Do you know what will happen if you go against the nobility!?」</p>
<p>「Are you idiots too? Are you going to rebel against the country and see what happens?」</p>
<p>「Wha...! Why would a mere soldier have that much authority...!?」</p>
<p>「Judging from the fact that Viscount Ozelos has a will to rebel against the country, we will now move on to the forced investigation!」</p>
<p>Immediately after the count declared so, Fran and Blue moved.</p>
<p>He slammed the twenty soldiers instantly. They hadn’t killed him, but they wouldn’t wake up for a while. The soldiers were a little surprised by the lightning magic that Fran and I unleashed, but the damage to us was about that.</p>
<p>「Stop interrogation. Capture or kill anyone in the mansion!」</p>
<p>「「「Yeah!」」」</p>
<p>「The two of you can move freely」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Please block the entrance.」</p>
<p>After separating from the soldiers, Blue and Fran started to move. They rushed through the small yard in front of the gate at once, and the sound of Fran kicking at the door of the mansion echoed through it.</p>
