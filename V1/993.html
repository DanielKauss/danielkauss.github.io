</div><h1>Chapter 993</h1><p>「Today is the time for atonement. Come on, Juanaverta.」</p>
<p>Juanaverta! No doubt about it! It was the name of an Intelligence Weapon that Trismegistus had!</p>
<p>Fran seemed to have noticed too.</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>I stared at the silver-white Falcion――Juanaverta, held by Trismegistus.</p>
<p>「That is...」</p>
<p>Trismegistus class would have noticed Fran’s gaze too. However, the golden dragonkin didn’t seem to care about Fran’s shards and started walking away defenseless.</p>
<p>It was not that he was ignoring Fran, but that he was not interested in her. It was probably because he had no hostility towards her, but he was not so interested in her as to call out to her here.</p>
<p>With Fran’s intense gaze on his back, Trismegistus walked leisurely. With each step he took, the tails that were sticking out of the robe swayed from side to side.</p>
<p>She even looked gracefully in front of us.</p>
<p>「H-Hurry up!」</p>
<p>「If you want to hurry, just hurry. I will not stop you, disciple of the priestess.」</p>
<p>「I’m Frederick.」</p>
<p>「If you want me to remember, then I’ll make you stronger」</p>
<p>Trismegistus didn’t laugh at all and said so with a straight face. Maybe we only remember him if he was serious and strong.</p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>Frederick’s face contorted. I could feel his groaning again.</p>
<p>「......You want to go further?」</p>
<p>「No, that’s too dangerous.」</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>「The basement of this castle is the place where the most antidemons spring up in the world. I’ll just rush in there on my own and you’ll die in vain」</p>
<p>Frederick was in panic, but did not try to get ahead of himself. On his way to a room called the Numerae, a surprisingly powerful antidemon horde appeared in droves.</p>
<p>Even Frederick was absolutely unable to break through it, even as he was now.</p>
<p>Apparently, her parents had taken her to a place where she couldn’t yet identify any attributes when she was a child.</p>
<p>The dragon warriors seemed to all follow the same ritual of passage, aiming to incite the greatest fear in their infants so that they could remain a little unfazed and unfrightened.</p>
<p>The safest way to break through these places is to go to Trismegistus. All we have to do is follow them and not strain ourselves.</p>
<p>Trismegistus, who was not interested in others, was not asking us to fight together. He was willing to do whatever it took to get along with him.</p>
<p>The invitation to come with us was a terrible irregularity. Thanks to Isario, one of the few people recognized by Trismegistus.</p>
<p>After listening to the underground explanation, Trismegistus arrived at a large hall at the back of the castle. It was a huge dome made of gray huge stones with almost no decoration. It was probably over 100 meters in diameter.</p>
<p>『Yeah, and that toughness... I don’t think it was just because of her high status』</p>
<p>Immediately after entering the dome, Fran and Urushi shivered and stopped. But that was no surprise.</p>
<p>From the center of the room, a huge, gray creature pierced through the floor and stuck out. There was no doubt about it. It was the body of the Abyss Eater, as seen from the outside of the castle.</p>
<p>Half of the dome was probably occupied by the Abyss Eater. To someone this close, it looked like a huge tree.</p>
<p>However, it did tell me that the extraordinary magic power released was no normal being. I should have made the presence of antidemons hundreds of times denser than normal, and this kind of magic power would have been useful if I had tried to attack them.</p>
<p>Or rather, it was more like they were in an aggressive state, or rather, in a state of hunger. I had been told that they couldn’t move, but I could tell that they were still trying to devour us even in this state.</p>
<p>I was very convinced that his doppelganger was an antidemon. He was worthy of the source of all greedy antidemons.</p>
<p>While Fran paused to stare at the Abyss Eater, Trismegistus went to the stairs beside the room. From there, he seemed to be able to go to the basement of the dome.</p>
<p>「Hey young miss, are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Don’t worry」</p>
<p>「From here on out, there’s hell. Get going again.」</p>
<p>「...Okay」</p>
<p>Was this a place that Isario called hell? I couldn’t even imagine. However, I didn’t think it was a good place to go if we were not careful.</p>
<p>『Fran, let’s go』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Fran and I will follow Trismegistus.</p>
<p>The stairs were just any normal down stairs we found. But when we stood in front of them, we were convinced that the other side was hell.</p>
<p>「A presence of an antidemon.」</p>
<p>『Yeah. Even in the presence of the Abyss Eater, I can sense a smug antidemon scurrying about......』</p>
<p>If all the antidemons ahead were released, the continent would be annihilated in no time. I could feel the magic of those antidemons so strong that I could think of it like that.</p>
<p>「Don’t worry. I said this castle was protected by the Gods, right? I heard the underground antidemons will never come out.」</p>
<p>It looked like the Gods were locked the Abyss Eaters and antidemons in the basement of the castle. Trismegistus went down the stairs, the entrance to what Isario said about hell, without hesitation.</p>
<p>It must be normal for that dragonkin. As we hurried after him, a change came immediately.</p>
<p>「Let’s get started.」</p>
<p>Trismegistus began to build up an enormous amount of magic power as we climbed down the stairs. Even before it was unleashed, his body was already golden, and the surrounding air was trembling.</p>
<p>And yet, he was not violent. It was nothing short of normal. He was not the one who was on the rampage in front of the battle.</p>
<p>Kin!</p>
<p>As if to make a warrior tremble in the face of the battle, Falcion’s blade of white silver trembled and ringed high above us.</p>
