</div><h1>Chapter 996</h1><p>Trismegistus continued fighting for about half an hour, and the antidemons in the underground space were destroyed. </p>
<p>「Phew.........」</p>
<p>When Trismegistus canceled his Divine Dragon Form, there was not a single antidemon left. The only trace of the antidemons was the wound on the ground drilled by the fierce battle. It had already been repaired. This was also part of the castle, and it seemed to have an auto-repair feature provided by the Gods. In a few hours, the wounds would be completely erased. And tomorrow, the battle between Trismegistus and the antidemons would only tatter them. And tomorrow, the battle between Trismegistus and the antidemons would wear them off again.  Trismegistus, who had meditated his wounds and regenerated them, soon started walking away before the wounds healed. He must have had a lot of invisible exhaustion, but his steps were as elegant as ever.  I was used to not looking back at us anymore, but I was surprised that he didn’t feel any damage at all. Was it because of his familiarity?  Anyways, it seemed that the bottom of that dragonkin was still unknown.  </p>
<p>「We’re coming too!」</p>
<p>  Frederick began to move, chasing after Trismegistus. He started to move in a hurry, but he didn’t run at full speed. He was walking behind Trismegistus with a somewhat irritated look on his face.  It seems there will be more battles yet to come. Therefore, they couldn’t leave Trismegistus behind yet.  The group continued to walk quietly through the dark underground space. Once the light of magic emitted by Trismegistus and the antidemons was gone, it was a world dominated by darkness.  But it was not normal for everyone here. Fran and the others continued to walk forward without any fear.  After about ten minutes of walking forward, we finally saw the end of this huge underground space. The scale of the passage was unbelievable, and there was a small door on the wall.  However, the strange presence emanating from the other side of the door was so strong that it made me think that we were in the front.  I see. There is no doubt that there is a nucleus of the Abyss Eater up ahead.  But still, there was something bothering me on the way. There were no signs of battle left, so it was not Trismegistus.  It was the traces of the Dragon King and his party that were supposed to be in the lead. If they were sure that they went underground, they should be passing through here. Since it wouldn’t be instantly repaired, the ground and other parts of the wall that had been destroyed by the battle should have remained intact. However, there were no signs of them.  </p>
<p>『Urushi, do you feel any Velmeria scent?』</p>
<p>(Woof!)</p>
<p>『Yeah, it’s not him?』</p>
<p>(Woof!)</p>
<p>  He nodded many times as if Urushi was certain. The scent of Velmeria remained strong here. Frederick’s seeker was sure to be there.  Then how did he get through the passage?  Did he disappear with his stealth abilities?  But can he deceive all the eyes of such high-ranking antidemons? Not only would he be a specialist in stealth, but he was in a group.  One possible possibility was that he could hide the entire group. So, it would be understandable if they thought they had just slipped through the entire group without fighting at all. Fran’s ability similar to the title of “Valkyrie” was quite possible.  The second one was teleportation.  We’ll pass through it all at once with continuous teleportation. I don’t think there’s anything we couldn’t do with it.  However, this place was enveloped in the magic of the Abyss Eater.  To be honest, I wouldn’t be able to use a decent teleportation. It would be impossible to activate it continuously, even if it only happens once.  If the opponent could do that, they would have a considerable advantage in the battle.  The third is the possibility of manipulating antidemons. If he could have completely manipulated the giantoids, he would have been able to manipulate the high-ranking antidemons here. Trismegistus muttered the first story about the lack of antidemons before thinking that they had been defeated by the Dragon Kings.  They have troublesome abilities in both ways, and I can’t let their guard down even if it’s different. While I was pondering this, Trismegistus pushed open the door.  A warm and fresh air surged through the air, ruffling the golden dragonkin’s bangs. I shouldn’t be able to sense any scent, but I felt a bloody smell.  The air was really moist.  Trismegistus’ indifference was grateful to us right now.  Everyone moved forward, continuing with Trismegistus through the stast and door. We followed them from the tail.  It was a strange passageway that was tall but narrow. Maybe it was made to resemble a dragonkin?  The two continued to walk in a vertical line through the aisle, without any ornamentation as usual. Isario and the others should have been blinded, so they couldn’t see ahead, but I could see the tension increasing. They were completely ready for battle.  They must have sensed the killing intent emanating from the other side of the passage.  It was not the killing intent of the Abyss Eaters that was mixed with their appetites. </p>
<p>『Fran, you’re giving off the presence of Velmeria』</p>
<p>(Nn...  But, it’s weird.)</p>
<p>Many were the culprits, and one of them was definitely a blue-haired dragonkin girl.</p>
