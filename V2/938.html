</div><h1>Chapter 938</h1><p>Fran was refused the mock battle by Isario and was out in town to heal her wounds. She was there to eat at the cafe where she met Sophie. Along the way, I suddenly heard the commotion of people. Apparently, something was going on at the north gate. I thought it was an antidemon attack, but it didn’t look like that. It was more of a cheer than a scream. I wondered why they were so excited when we arrived at the gate. Apparently, a famous army had arrived. Apparently, a famous army had arrived. The people running beside Fran were talking about what kind of person had come this time.  Nocta was a popular destination for many people, and famous adventurers parties, knights, and mercenaries were probably frequent here. It seemed that onlookers here had become a kind of entertainment to the town’s people.  After walking for a while, there was a group of people walking toward us on the main street. They were surrounded by onlookers, so I’m sure they were the center of the ruckus. As we stopped and looked at them, we saw a group of passersby.  All the leaders wore matching armor, which proved to be a knight order.  Including the knights and their retainers, it was probably a group of about 300 people.As we paused to look in the same direction, we saw a group of about 300 people, including the knights and their retainers.  They looked familiar with the knight’s white silver armor.  </p>
<p>(The holy knights?)</p>
<p>『Yeah, these are the knights of Silard.』</p>
<p>  I had just seen the emblems of crossed swords and horses on white silver armor reflecting the sunlight.  I couldn’t be mistaken. They were the holy knights of the Holy Nation of Silard.  Could it be that there were also divine sword knights among them?  Because of the guards of honor walking while raising their flags, I couldn’t see the center of the group. But I couldn’t sense any sign of them.  But isn’t this quite bad? What would happen if the holy knights fleeing Sendia reported to their main forces in a convenient way?  Fran could have been viewed as enemies by the holy knights. If they were all that kind of people, they wouldn’t listen to us.  </p>
<p>『Fran, let’s leave for now.』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p>  Just as Fran was about to leave the scene because she became an onlooker, another commotion broke out from the gate. It seemed that a famous group had arrived again.  While leaving the holy knights, we headed toward the gate. There, we found a group of strange-looking men, dressed in matching equipment.  There were a total of more than a thousand people, just like a group of soldiers rather than a knight. Moreover, they were all composed of old men.  A group of old spearmen appeared through the gate, dressed in plain jet-black light equipment.  Furthermore, we saw a carriage in the center.  It was a very sumptuous white carriage, unlike the equipment of the plain old men. It was pulled by eight legs of horses.  It was the rank C monster, Slape Neil. That was enough to stand out enough, but a strange magical power was leaking out from inside.  It seemed that even powerful magicians were riding on it.  Was the commander also inside that carriage?  The flag was a black sword on a red background and a large white flower that crossed with it. It was a flag that looked terrifying and noble that could not be forgotten at first glance.  </p>
<p>「That flag is the flag of the Militant Nation of Hagane」</p>
<p>「Hagane is the north? You mean Silard and his dog apes, right?」</p>
<p>「Hey, hey, don’t skirmish in Nocta, okay?」</p>
<p>  Along with Fran, she listened to the people’s conversations.  It seemed that this army belonged to the Militant Nation of Hagane. They were supposed to be a military power that divided the northern continent from the Holy Nation of Silard.  We have a strong impression of them as countries that possessed the divine sword Berserk. So, they came to Nocta from both military powers.  </p>
<p>(Are they there any Divine Swords?)</p>
<p>『Hmmm, in a carriage? I don’t know it’s in a place we couldn’t see though』</p>
<p>(Unfortunately.)</p>
<p>  Fran probably wanted to see Berserk at first sight.  </p>
<p>『Let’s go to the Adventurers Guild later.  We might find something.』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p>  For the time being, we went to a cafe, which was our original goal. But we met some faces we had met along the way.  </p>
<p>「Oh? It’s not Fran!」</p>
<p>「Oh, you’re back!」</p>
<p>「Jayne, Orfalve.」</p>
<p> There is a pair of queens who had helped us at Castel. They were Jayne Dovey, the Queen of the Demons, and Orfalve Falnius, the Dwarf Queen. They seemed to be getting along as well, and they were accompanying their escorts five at a time.  </p>
<p>「Long time no see!」</p>
<p>「You seem to be doing great, aren’t you?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Thank you for staying still.」</p>
<p>「I only made a promise, so that’s not surprising!」</p>
<p>「I’ll stay out with you until the antidemon season is over or I wake up.」</p>
<p>  They remained in this city as Nadia’s guards too.  They had been staying here at a regular pace.  </p>
<p>「You’ve gotten stronger again, huh? The aura you unleash is different!」</p>
<p>「Indeed.  The battle in Sendia seems to have been tremendous. If it’s okay, can you tell me the details?」</p>
<p>「Okay.」</p>
<p>「Yeah, I did!  Well then, there’s a restaurant I recommend. Let’s go there」</p>
<p>「There’s even a private room over there」</p>
<p>  The two were taken to a hideout-like restaurant on a back alley. However, it was quite spacious inside, and the Queen’s guards would be able to eat there.  There were even private rooms in the back.  Apparently, it was a high-class restaurant. The price of the dishes was quite high, but they were not the kind of people who would care. They sat at the table with a proper meal and the most expensive liquor.  </p>
<p>「Then, meet up with your friends again!」</p>
<p>「Hmm!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  The meal and briefing began, in a friendly atmosphere, to talk about how they had been divided.  Fran’s report was always a surprise to them though. But we were also taken aback by her surprise.  To our surprise, Jayne knew about the Divine Beast Form. Well, it was only a little bit though.  </p>
<p>「The Demon Lord of long ago must have made undead beastmen with Divine Beast Form skills his kindred. He was said to be a friend of the King and left telling his body to be used more effectively after his death.」</p>
<p>「Do you know how to learn to become a Divine Beastman?」</p>
<p>「Hmmm, no detailed information has been passed on to him. However, the legends should have told me that he was approved by the Gods and was a White Wolf」</p>
<p>「To be approved by the Gods...」</p>
<p>  In other words, should I have achieved enough achievement to be recognized by the Gods?</p>
<p>「The Demon Lord in ancient times must have had undead Beastmen with Divine Beast Form skills as his kin. He was said to be a friend of the King and told his body to use his body more effectively after his death」</p>
<p>「Do you know how to learn to become a Divine Beast?」</p>
<p>「Hmm, no detailed information has been passed on to me. However, the legends should have told me that he was approved by the Gods and was a White Wolf」</p>
<p>「To be approved by the Gods...」</p>
<p> In other words, should I have achieved enough achievement to be recognized by the Gods? At the very least, it didn’t seem like I just have to increase my status.</p>
