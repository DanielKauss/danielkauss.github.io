</div><h1>Chapter 982</h1><p>「Ruoooourgh!」</p>
<p>「Haaah!」</p>
<p> The battle between Fran and Rezalua was seemingly even. Although Fran outmatched Rezalua in terms of sword skills and speed, Rezalua swung violently at us, showing no signs of taking any hits. Moreover, the sword coming out of her hard arms was tremendously powerful. </p>
<p>『How tough!』</p>
<p>(Nn. The scales look just like armor.)</p>
<p> Maybe it was because Rezalua’s red scales were strengthened by the Dragon God’s Sacrament, but they were very tough. They couldn’t even get a scratch with a light poke. With a light feint, she won’t get a scratch. Even if she was slashed open by a strong attack, her regeneration skills would soon return to normal.  That made them very troublesome.  Another troublesome thing was their ability to recover.  Not only the scales, but also the wounds that pierced below them were instantly closed. We used life magic to slow down the healing of our wounds, but it didn’t seem to work.  The black lightning that pierced his body many times didn’t seem to care, and paralysis didn’t work.  In fact, he even dared to attack us at an unexpected time. The way she missed the timing showed her experience in combat.  However, Resalva was quite irritated for not matching her age.  It seemed that being equal with a girl like Fran damaged her pride. The negative effects of his mental manipulation might not be able to control his emotions.  Besides, Fran knew this too.  She was not even in her current state. Fran was not serious yet, and Resalva was gradually losing her magic power. That was how much Resalva was using regeneration and physical enhancement to push herself further.  Even though the elder herself was pushing herself too hard, Fran was fighting with less exhaustion thinking about what would happen after this. It must be the opposite of Resalva’s feelings.  She attacked even more violently, but Fran handled it with all her might. In the meantime, my magic unleashed and accumulated damage to Resalva.  Was it because I had watched Isario’s battle before? Fran’s parrying technique was even sharper than before, and she was able to perfectly defend against Resalva’s greatsword.Maybe it was because she had seen Isario’s fight before, Fran’s parrying technique was even sharper than before, and she was now able to defend against Resalva’s greatsword perfectly.  Even if the attacks that could cause damage to her comrades were to fall, she would lose the power and escape the impact into the sky.  As we fought, I could see that Fran was growing.  However, our opponent this time was an experienced old warrior. Even though his thoughts were dulled by the mental manipulation, he soon realized that Fran was fighting to avoid causing any damage to his comrades.  </p>
<p>「Can you prevent this?」</p>
<p>「Muh!」</p>
<p>「Gwooorgh!」</p>
<p>  Resalva unleashed a large amount of flames from his mouth. It wasn’t very powerful, but a direct hit from the soldiers and adventurers was no ordinary attack. Moreover, the range of the attack was wide.  </p>
<p>「Haaaah!」</p>
<p>  Fran unleashed magic and slashes on the spur of the moment to extinguish the flames.  But this was Rezzar’s aim.  She had set aside some time to pause Fran’s movement and unleash a larger technique. Her back bent greatly, and her chest plate swelled almost twice.  </p>
<p>「Gaaaaaaaaaahhh!」</p>
<p>  From there, a red flash of light was emitted. The exhalation of flames, enough to ignite the air, rushed in a straight line toward Fran, who had finished intercepting the flames. I could dodge, but if Fran didn’t catch them, the people behind her would surely suffer a great deal of damage.  </p>
<p>「Haaaaah!」</p>
<p>「Gaaaaaaaaahhh!」</p>
<p> Fran’s barrier and Resalva’s flames collided, and the red light then dyed the surroundings.  </p>
<p>『Fran! Just withstand two more seconds!』</p>
<p>「Daaaaaaah!」</p>
<p>  Fran used her magic release to scatter the red flash of light.  This was probably the result of her watching Isario’s battle. Not only was she parrying it with her sword, but her entire defensive action had grown.  But it was not even close to Isario’s. It was just right after Fran’s hand, which was thrust forward, began to glow with a fever and smoke.  </p>
<p>『We won’t waste Fran’s hard work!』</p>
<p>  I activated my Dimensional Magic.  What I did was the same as when I blocked the giant-type stones. I used the Dimension Gate to shoot back its fire.  But I couldn’t just release it properly in this state of disorderly battle. So, I opened the gate directly above it.  </p>
<p>「Gargh!  What!」</p>
<p>  It had a high flame resistance, so the damage was not that bad.  However, she must have been upset by the sudden attack from the complete lack of enemy presence. He stopped attacking and turned his head upwards involuntarily.  That was a big gap. Fran didn’t miss that moment and went all in on the offensive.  Even without Fran saying anything, it was telling me what she wanted to do. I gathered the divine and magical energy and put it on my blade. By accelerating with magic and skills, Fran was able to leave only the afterimage of black lightning and thinning it into the old dragon warrior’s warrior at a brisk pace of instant movement. Resalva soon noticed too, but by that time, Fran had already swung me down from above.  </p>
<p>「Impossible...!」</p>
<p>「...... Fuh」</p>
<p>  Resalva fell to the ground with her shoulders to the groin cut in half. The fight was overly quiet.  </p>
<p>「Gah...  Gughah... Why are you here......?」</p>
<p>  It was impressive that she didn’t die instantly, but divine energy attacks were difficult to regenerate.  As one would expect from a high-level antidemon, she probably didn’t have the same regenerative abilities as ordinary antidemons. She soon stopped moving.  </p>
<p>『We were able to defeat a strong opponent with minimal magic consumption.』</p>
<p>(I’m sure they would have been in a pinch if their opponent had been much wiser.)</p>
<p>『You’re right.  I’m sure we had to use our strongest move.』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p>  Fran looked a little disappointed in a place like this.</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
