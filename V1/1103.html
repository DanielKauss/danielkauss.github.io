</div><h1>Chapter 1103</h1><p>Fran and Urushi ran through the town of Alessa, where no one was outside. People were low in the house, and all of their stores were closed.</p>
<p>In Gordicia, people were surprisingly coming and going even if the town was being attacked. Maybe they were used to attacking antidemons, so they had little sense of urgency. So, this must mean that they were going to war with the real antidemons.</p>
<p>Soldiers were still patrolling the town, but no one was doing anything about Fran. They were just too fast, and no matter how I thought about it, they were not undead enemies. They must have thought that this was just an order from an adventurer.</p>
<p>As expected, she was stopped in front of the feudal lord’s building, but she could just take out her adventurer’s card and get through. As I thought, Fran’s name seemed to be more recognized in Alessa than I had imagined.</p>
<p>She was not suspected and did not expect to be understood as soon as she presented her card.</p>
<p>Notes: I got an issue with my editor, he hasn’t done anything on his part for these past ten days, and this is the last chapter he has edited. He’s miraculously back! XD</p>
<p>Apparently, this man was Alessa’s feudal lord. I couldn’t feel any aggression, nor was he sharp. He seemed to be a well- dressed uncle who seemed to be anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>He looks unreliable, but is he okay? Or is he something like an Isario, a pretty good type of guy when the time comes?</p>
<p>「Fran-san...... I have to welcome you.」</p>
<p>「Nn. I’m back」</p>
<p>「The Black Lightning Princess, huh!? She had become famous all along!」</p>
<p>Klimt looked a little annoyed, but Urushi was more than happy with it. Klimt must hate Fran―or rather, a child that might be involved in a war.</p>
<p>But now that we don’t know what our enemy is capable of, we should welcome the strong reinforcements. There are times when the interests of Alessa and the Kingdom of Kranzel should take precedence over Klimt’s personal feelings.</p>
<p>Therefore, even if Klimt himself was not welcome, the Guild Master could not help but welcome Fran.</p>
<p>「Klimt, I’ll talk about it later」</p>
<p>「You want to talk?」</p>
<p>「Nn. I want to know about Spirit Magic」</p>
<p>「I-I’m fine...... But what should I do after this commotion is over?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran knew that this was not the case right now.</p>
<p>「Are you the Black Lightning Princess? I’m Zenos Amkranse. I’m supposed to be the feudal lord of this town, though」</p>
<p>「Maybe?」</p>
<p>「Don’t worry about it, I’ll just stay here」</p>
<p>He seemed to be a very easy-going nobleman. Is he really the feudal lord? Well, it was still small as a town, so maybe it was a low-ranking nobleman.</p>
<p>That’s what I thought, but I was wrong.</p>
<p>「Fran, this man looks like he’s royalty. You shouldn’t treat him too mischievously just because he doesn’t have dignity」</p>
<p>「Urushi, you’re saying the worse, right?」</p>
<p>「Oh? Is that so?」</p>
<p>No, wait. What did you just say?</p>
<p>「Royal?」</p>
<p>「Bye bye. They only have enough power to shove the feudal lord of a town close to the front line.」</p>
<p>「Hmm」</p>
<p>「Of course. Where there are adventurers, there will be adventurers guilds.」</p>
<p>「You really don’t have to worry about it. They’re just people who are not allowed to identify themselves as Kranzel. So, those who can fight now are much more important than those who are capable of fighting」</p>
<p>It seems that she really was the feudal lord of the ornamentation.</p>
<p>The friendly relations between Klimt and Urushi also showed that he was not a bad person.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t seem to be a very talented person, since he hadn’t been able to completely stop Count Augist and Count Ormez from doing this. To put it bluntly, he may be the type to leave it to others.</p>
<p>「The town’s defenses are left to the knights and the Adventurers Guild. Fran-san would appreciate it if you could help me too, right?」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「Well, for now, let’s deal with the undead that are currently attacking us」</p>
<p>「Indeed. It would be difficult for the knights to deal with the undead.」</p>
<p>「Is that so?」</p>
<p>「It won’t be able to do much if I don’t use magic」</p>
<p>Since the undead continued to move no matter how hard they cut or pierced, it would be difficult for a knight order to deal with this issue with few magicians.</p>
<p>However, because the main forces of adventurers were lacking, they were not able to take care of the adventurers well enough.</p>
<p>「It would be a pity to rely on children, but please defeat the undead. Can you do it?」</p>
<p>「I’d have plenty of leeway with just that」</p>
<p>「Phew. Now that we have the report from Gordicia, we’re still in a hurry.」</p>
<p>「Hehe.」</p>
<p>「I’m not praising you」</p>
<p>Klimt smiled bitterly at us. I guess he was trying to tell us not to hurry, but it had saved us this time. I guess he can’t be strong.</p>
<p>As for me, I’d like her to tell more about it, because it would be precious for me to be able to worry about Fran in this way.</p>
<p>I can’t say “Don’t do your best” to the adventurers who were about to go to the battlefield.</p>
<p>「But first, I’d like you to deal with the undead that have entered the town」</p>
<p>「That was awesome!」</p>
<p>「Yes, it’s like I haven’t defeated it yet. Moreover, it has a high level of stealth, and it hasn’t caught up with my spirits yet. It was a miracle that I was able to detect it when we invaded」</p>
<p>It would be a tricky opponent to even scatter spirits around. It could even be much more troublesome than the undead outside.</p>
<p>「Okay」</p>
<p>「I’m counting on you all not to cause any damage to the town.」</p>
<p>Klimt nailed this! I know Fran!</p>
<p>「After that, if at all possible, please head to the walls to cover for them.」</p>
<p>「Is there any adventurer outside?」</p>
<p>「I don’t think any of them are out of this town, since they are giving orders to lure them and strike them with long-range attacks!」</p>
<p>「Then, are you okay with doing something flashy?」</p>
<p>「No problem」</p>
<p>If we were outside this, we would be a violator of the order and I wouldn’t be responsible for Fran even if she gets caught in it. Well, Fran might be worried if we killed her, so why don’t Urushi and I be careful?</p>
<p>『Urushi, let me know if you see any people outside the city walls』</p>
<p>(Woof!)</p>
<p>So they ignored orders and went outside, or was it Raidos’ scouting force? It was unlikely that they were an outside adventurer who came to Alessa’s rescue and became involved in an undead fight.</p>
<p>Well, we’ll have to deal with the situation in the town first.</p>
<p>「Let’s go then!」</p>
<p>「I leave it to you」</p>
<p>「If you need anything, you can use the knights! Come on, take this with you!」</p>
<p>「Thanks」</p>
<p>Urushi threw over the emblem of the knight order. This must be a substitute for the power of command.</p>
<p>「Black Lightning Princess, please take care of Alessa」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Seeing as Zenos bowed his head and Klimut looked as austere as ever, Fran ran out of the room.</p>
