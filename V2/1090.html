</div><h1>Chapter 1090</h1><p>「T-That’s really bad!」</p>
<p> A soldier working for us jumped into the office without knocking. His face was pale, and I knew that something was going on. So, we should scold him later. </p>
<p>「What happened? Did the magicians annihilate this time?」</p>
<p> The other day, in the tower for research in our castle, there was a huge incident in which the alchemists under his command died all at once. According to the Chief Magician who did the investigation, he had been cursed to death by the turned curse. The alchemists under our command died all at once.  According to the Chief Magician who did the investigation, the curse was killed by the reversed curse.  A curse was a vicious power that, depending on how you use it, can have an effect on a wide area.  However, this was also a double-edged sword. When the curse was returned or erased, the curse returned to the user. The reason for the alchemists’ annihilation was the curse they had brought back.  It seems that the magic stone weapon they brought with them to the Kingdom of Kranzel for wide area contamination had been destroyed. Normally, the curse would have gone out of control and polluted the surroundings, but some of it had returned to the casters.  I didn’t think it would be easy to return the curse that the alchemists had put in together, but there had been actual damage.I didn’t think it would be easy to return the curse that the alchemists had put together, but the wound was actually dead.  It was either the very powerful magician who performed the curse, or he destroyed the stone with his magic formula.  The only one who hurt was Ansel’s death, who was the head of the alchemist.  He shouldn’t have been involved in the wide area contamination curse, but for some reason, he had lost his life.  How much do you think he had invested in that madman?  Did he just die so easily?  Even though he was the only one who could replicate the magic sword used to kill demons in a deteriorating manner! Thanks to that, we had to rethink our strategy against Philias.  I was really in a terrible situation. And that’s why I made a joke about how many magicians I had wiped out... </p>
<p>「D-Did you know?」</p>
<p>「What?  What do you mean?」</p>
<p>「Th-the magicians have been annihilated!」</p>
<p>「I-impossible!」</p>
<p>  We heard screams from the magician’s research tower over and over again, and when we stepped foot in, all the people inside had died and collapsed.  We rushed to the tower and found that many guards and magicians were already gathered at the entrance. They called out to the magician chief who was with them. </p>
<p>「What happened?」</p>
<p>「Reveres-sama!  I’m currently investigating, but the magicians under my command have been completely wiped out. There is a possibility that they were caused by poison, so I hope they won’t be able to approach us any further」</p>
<p>「W-What poison is it?」</p>
<p>「Haah! No magician has any injuries, and there are no signs of being attacked.」</p>
<p>「... Okay」</p>
<p>  And of course, poison research was being conducted in the research tower.  If that were really the cause, wouldn’t this place be in danger? No, is it not a problem that the soldiers are safe?  </p>
<p>「We have classified documents inside the Sanatorium, so it’s not easy to investigate......」</p>
<p>「The guards are allowed to enter the Sanatorium, so hurry to find out what’s going on. With assassination in mind――」</p>
<p>「Bryne, Duke-sama!  This time it’s tough!」</p>
<p>「This time!」</p>
<p>「T-This way......」</p>
<p>  The messenger takes me to a less popular place.  Was there an emergency that no one else could hear?  </p>
<p>「What happened?」</p>
<p>「In addition to the three water dragon ships, all the ships we sent have sunk......!」</p>
<p>「Don’t be stupid!  There are only three water dragon ships, you know? And I’m sure they had some magicians on board!」</p>
<p>「Th-that’s right, but it is true that we lost contact with them......」</p>
<p> What’s going on?  Does that really mean the fleet has sunk?  It’s a water dragonkin that we couldn’t even handle, right? As I was wondering, I saw a magician chief running toward us after running through the on-site inspection. He must have realized something.  </p>
<p>「 duke, the cause of death of his men has been found. It seems that the curse he returned has killed him」</p>
<p>「Cursed? See ya!」</p>
<p>「At Ansel-dono’s request, one of his men was sent out to curse me. It must have been a curse placed on the magic stone soldiers deployed in the Kingdom of Shallus.」</p>
<p>「Are you saying that the curse was returned?」</p>
<p>「Yes.  In other words...」</p>
<p>「So there’s something wrong with the army that was supposed to attack from the Shallus Kingdom」</p>
<p>  I don’t understand.  Or did the Kranzel Kingdom deploy a countermeasure against the curse all over their army? This requires investigation.  </p>
<p>「You need to get in touch with Dirk.  We’ll have him gather information about Kranzel as soon as possible」</p>
<p>「... That’s it」</p>
<p> The Chief Magician blurted out my words.  </p>
<p>「What’s wrong?」</p>
<p>「Derick-dono’s regular contact has been cut off. Also, the reason why Ansel-dono lost his life was thought to be the return of his curse of killing demons...」</p>
<p>「In other words, more than half of the alchemists and magicians were killed by the curse, and the fleet, including the water dragonkin, was annihilated. Do you mean that the ground forces that he had sent to Shallus were also destroyed, and that Dirk was in a situation where he could not be contacted?」</p>
<p>「...I-Is that so?」</p>
<p>「Don’t be ridiculous! How much time and money did you think you’ve spent to get things in order!」</p>
<p> We had been preparing for over a dozen years to make sure we defeated the Kingdom of Kranzel and then drop Filurias!  I finally thought that we had started the plan, but everything failed in a few days?  How much of a power did the Kingdom of Kranzel have left in the defense of the country!  I am in a position to get a lot of information about the country. I don’t want to take a one-sided look at adventurers like those idiots.  But still, I can’t say that they are so strong! After Marquis Ashtner’s plan to destroy the Royal Capital of Kranzel was half-heartedly finished, they should have been on the lookout for Kranzel to the fullest extent possible...  But is it possible that the information is leaking from somewhere?  We must consider the possibility as well.  </p>
<p>「You can use all the stealth troops.  Look for the situation in Kranzel.  Even if you are captured, Dirk will not speak. He should still be able to use his base or personnel.」</p>
<p>「U-Understood!」</p>
<p>  That would prolong our invasion of the Kingdom of Philias again! In fact, it will take years for them to regain their damage...  </p>
<p>「Shit!  Shit!」</p>
<p>  Always be calm.  As the previous generation had said when he took over the throne, he could not be calm. On the contrary, I know that it was a meaningless curse coming out of my mouth. She knew that our territory had been hit by a blow that was indescribable and that it had become a sinking ship.  She bit the claws of her thumb so hard that she could break them.  The habit of being corrected at such a young age would involuntarily appear.  She must be so upset.  It was just a stupid thing. What she was doing looked strangely objective.  </p>
<p>「Gubuh.  It seems you’re in trouble, doesn’t it?」</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>  I saw something unpleasant about it from someone I didn’t like. Thanks to that, I’ve regained some of my composure.  But before I knew it, the man standing behind us was a faceless, petite man in a black robe. This man was Hydeman, the intelligent undead under the control of the Southern Duke.  </p>
<p>「... Hydeman, huh?  He’s still showing up everywhere, right?」</p>
<p>「Since that’s me. Besides, you’re allowed to enter this place, right?」</p>
<p>「What did you need?」</p>
<p>「I thought I could help you, but what do you think? Let’s look for Duke-dono and make a connection with her?」</p>
<p>「...... You want to save me and save the Southern Duke―― No, what’s in it for the Black Skeleton Corps?」</p>
<p>「What in the world do you think those in the service of your country should help each other when they are in trouble?」</p>
<p>  White.  What kind of help is this?  Rotten undead!? In the first place, isn’t the timing too good?  That’s right, as if they knew that they would need our help. Could it be that he had information on Kranzel’s side...?  </p>
<p>「Oya?  Even if you stare at me, things won’t get any better, okay?」</p>
<p>「I know!」</p>
<p>  He’s being too suspicious, but there’s no proof. Besides, since he is a high-ranking member of the Black Skeleton Corps, there is no doubt that this undead speaking guy could be used.  </p>
<p>「Hmph. Now that Dirk is back, my mansion is already...」</p>
<p>「Gufufufu.  I have a proposal for that」</p>
<p>「... What is it?」</p>
<p>「I’d like you to lend me the western treasure...」</p>
<p>  This guy!  That’s what he’s been doing from the beginning! As expected, the Southern Duke is......!  </p>
<p>「Don’t be ridiculous!  The treasure is the family treasure given to me by the first Duke to prove his title! There is no way I can leave it to another family!」</p>
<p>「However, the southern treasure and the western treasure are originally supposed to be used in pairs.  With that in mind, it is possible to throw a stone at the current battle situation.  It is still possible to prevent a complete failure now, right? My Lord will surely be grateful.」</p>
<p>  Certainly, my failure could end the invasion at this rate. If that happens, the south and east sides will pursue my responsibility.  However, the treasure is the Duke’s secret art.</p>
<p>「Gubuh!</p>
<p>「Gubuh! We’ve accepted Hydeman, sixth seat of the Black Skeleton Corps!」</p>
