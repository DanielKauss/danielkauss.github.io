</div><h1>Chapter 939</h1><p>After separating from Jayne and Jayne, Fran was now back at the Adventurers Guild. We wanted to get some information about the Holy Nation of Silard and the Militant Nation of Hagane. The queen duo had also taught us a lot about the two countries, but I didn’t know why they came to this town. If we were going to fight around here, we might be able to see the activation of the Divine Sword. When we arrived at the Adventurers Guild, we saw no holy knights or soldiers. Maybe they have already left? I wonder if they have already left?  We went inside and tried to talk to the adventurers.  But before we could talk, the woman at the reception desk approached us first.  </p>
<p>「Black Lightning Princess-sama!  So, you have returned! I’ve heard that the guild master has a story to discuss, can I ask his office for it?」</p>
<p>「Guild master’s room?」</p>
<p>「Please do」</p>
<p>「... Okay」</p>
<p>  She was waiting for Fran.  It would be too early to talk to the guildmaster directly, so I’ll follow his orders. I guess the reason why Fran hesitated slightly was because she was not very good with that sex appealed Mun Guild Master. She walked a little heavy toward the guildmaster’s room, and found that there were a few men and women waiting for her alongside the guildmaster.  One of them was the reliable Dandysm submaster. With him, we could manage to hold Replare back from his outbursts.  Isario was also sitting on the sofa.  He was sitting on the three-person sofa in front of the guildmaster, drinking his booze.  So this is a Rank S adventurer...... No, Fran may be the same type as him when she’s starting to eat in front of an important person. Well, it was reassuring to know some of them.  The only problem was the other two.  One was sitting on the chair on the right side of the sofa where the guildmasters sat, and the other was using a chair on the left side of the opposite.  I guess the holy knight standing behind the man on his left is his escort. From the intimidation I could sense, he didn’t seem to be the wielder of the divine sword.  There was a tension between the two that could be seen at a glance from the fact that they were not getting along.There was so much tension between the two that it was easy to tell at a glance that they were not close.  They never looked at each other, yet they were very conscious of each other.  I’d never seen either of them, but I could tell which part they belonged at a glance.  If they knew they were going to meet here, they would have refused.  </p>
<p>「I was thinking of calling them later, but they just came to the right place」</p>
<p>「Come on, you’re sitting there.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>  Fran stared at the holy knight with sideways eyes and sat down next to Isario. She sat down next to Isario.  The smell of alcohol would be better than next to the others.  After confirming that Fran was sitting down, the submaster opened his mouth.  </p>
<p>「Let me introduce you first. Sitting next to Black Lightning Princess-dono is a Rank S adventurer――」</p>
<p>「Isario the without talent. </p>
<p>「You will be like that again......」</p>
<p>「I don’t know how to describe yourself, but I don’t want to hear a cool name like that.  You don’t want to be like me because I’m just a flamethrower with a red lotus blade.  Isario shrugged his shoulders and shouted back at the submaster’s damn eyes. His voice showed that he was not humble, nor was he embarrassed. Isario seemed to seriously think that the alias of “person without talent” was suitable for him.  Fran tilted her head.  I guess she thought it was strange that the alias of an S-ranked adventurer was “person without talent”. </p>
<p>「Why are you without talent?」</p>
<p>「Hahaha, I like you a lot」</p>
<p>「Hmm...」</p>
<p>  Fran didn’t ask him any more questions.  If he liked her, she probably thought it was inevitable.  After all, the submaster wanted her to give her an alias a little more extreme. After all, he’s a Rank S adventurer who is at the top of all adventurers and has always been longing for.  It was not a joke to have such a person with a strange alias, but it was related to the morale of the adventurer. But Isario was told what kind of wind she was.  </p>
<p>「Come on, you’re in the middle of introducing me now, right?」</p>
<p>「I-is that so?  I’m sorry.  The man sitting there is the Knight-dono of the Holy Nation of Silard.  He is the head of an organization called the Divine Sword Agency, which administers the Divine Swords. He’s of the highest level」</p>
<p>「Nice to meet you」</p>
<p>「And behind that is the current Divine Sword Knight-dono」</p>
<p>「Divine Sword Knight!?」</p>
<p>  Fran asked back with a surprised look on her face.  Then the guard nodded again with a smile.  </p>
<p>「Hello young miss, I’m Adoll, the Divine Sword Knight of the age. Please know him.」</p>
<p>  The man who seemed to be her escort was the Divine Sword Knight, Adoll Yaresfeim, the wielder of the Divine Sword Alpha.  At first glance, he looked like a refreshing figure. If he hadn’t made a secret agreement with Filuria, he might have believed that.  But is this man really a Divine Sword Knight?  He is strong. But considering that he was the wielder of the Divine Sword, I felt a shortage.  Besides, he doesn’t seem to be imbued with a Divine Sword. To be honest, I was really not sure if he was the wielder of the Divine Sword at this point.  Perhaps, in his current state, he was much weaker than Zefmate. It was not only because of her status as a Divine Sword Knight, but also because she was not suited for that title.  However, Fran was able to make such decisions by suppressing her expression and bowing her head. </p>
<p>「I’ve heard from Fran, a B-ranked adventurer, and Replare-dono, that she’s a great adventurer.  It’s an honor to meet her. I heard that Sendia’s defense was a fierce battle that was hard to beat.」</p>
<p>「Nn.  There were hundreds of thousands of antidemons.」</p>
<p>「That’s amazing!  It’s like the holy knights in our country fought in Sendia and lost their lives. But I can understand if there were so many antidemons.」</p>
<p>  Adoll was not lying. Apparently, the holy knights of the scum had been killed by antidemons before they returned to their main forces.  To be honest, I was greatly grateful for our help. This would prevent the worst case scenario of them being considered enemies by the holy knights.  I’d like to ask her about our relationship with Filuria, but I’d like to make a excuse for the bushes snakes. Let’s just say hello for now. </p>
<p>「And the one sitting there is Commander of the troops of the Militant Nation of Hagane.」</p>
<p>「I’m Black Lightning Princess-dono, my name is Hi.  I’m the one in charge of commanding this Expeditionary Force.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Nice to meet you.」</p>
<p>  The one bowing his head was a very neutral person. I think he was probably a woman, but at first glance, he looked like your handsome daughter.  Isn’t he stronger than Adar?  But wasn’t the commander the wielder of the Divine Sword?  The Divine Sword Berserk possessed by Militant Nation of Hagane was supposed to kill the wielder. So, it was not the type of weapon that the commander will use. </p>
<p>「I’d like to talk to you slowly eventually」</p>
<p>「Nn. I’d like to hear more from you too.」</p>
<p>「Fufufu, please do your best then.」</p>
<p>  I didn’t sense any hostility, but I couldn’t read his intentions.In fact, we might have to be most vigilant for now.</p>
