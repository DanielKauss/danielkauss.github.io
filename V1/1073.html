</div><h1>Chapter 1073</h1><p>「I’m not going to be saved anymore...」</p>
<p>Fran, lying on the ground facing to the right, spits out a lot of blood. Even though Fran’s appearance was canceled and she returned to her human form, the knife on her back was still the same.</p>
<p>「Frut! Maximum Heal!」</p>
<p>Fran uses healing magic on Fran, but the wounds were almost non-healable. The cursing that flowed from the knife into Fran seemed to be blocking her healing.</p>
<p>However, Fran did not try to stop healing him. She tried using maximal heals many times already.</p>
<p>「It’s already too late... Fran」</p>
<p>「That’s not possible!」</p>
<p>Fran looked surprisingly calm, but her life force and mana continued to dwindle at a terrifying rate.</p>
<p>Upon appraisal, I found that Fran was in a state of cursed contamination. I had never seen her before, but she was clearly not in a calm state. Just like the ability of a knife to kill a demon, it was a weapon that seemed to be aimed at Phyllius’ demon users.</p>
<p>We also tried to release the curse and detoxify it, but it didn’t work. When I put the Divine Attribute in, it works a little, but it doesn’t go completely unscathed. It only reduces the speed of the curse’s flow by half while I’m using it.</p>
<p>Fran’s life force and mana continued to dwindle.</p>
<p>He said he was going to kill a demon, so maybe that was the reason? My life was spilling from within Fran.</p>
<p>「Maximum Heal!」</p>
<p>「Fran, ask me.」</p>
<p>「Don’t talk, don’t talk!」</p>
<p>「It’s fine... I want you to listen to me」</p>
<p>「......Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran didn’t want to stop her anymore, and it seemed that she had no intention of stopping her either.</p>
<p>What I learned from that encounter was that Phyllius was also under attack from Raidos.</p>
<p>However, they did not use direct invasion by force, but cursing magic through large-scale rituals. They were said to be using the flow of magic power known as the Dragon’s Bloodline that ran through the earth, and cursing was spreading in certain areas of Phyllius that made them lose their power.</p>
<p>People were losing their vitality and the fruits of their crops were being lost. They were still in the early stages of the war, but the damage was considerable. If left unchecked, the country could turn to them.</p>
<p>「This village is where it started...」</p>
<p>「Where does it come from?」</p>
<p>「Aah...... That...」</p>
<p>Fran managed to move her trembling arms and pointed to the center of the plaza. There, she found a huge magic stone.</p>
<p>「It’s sucking power from people... It’s sustaining the curse......」</p>
<p>Wasn’t it a magic stone set up by Raidos rather than by Fran and the others?</p>
<p>In other words, the Kingdom of Raidos had taken over the area and activated its curse as a living magic cell for the villagers. However, Philias sensed this in some way, attacked them and took away their control of the village.</p>
<p>At first, he thought that it was Kranzel’s doing, but after analyzing the magic stones, he found out that it was set by Raidos. I guess that was why Raidos heard about Kranzel and attacked her. They thought that Kranzel was their enemy.</p>
<p>I also think that Fran’s participation was one of the reasons why Rayus went out of control and eliminated Fran. For whatever reason, I wanted to hide the fact that the royalty was violating the border.</p>
<p>If they wanted to protect the Kingdom of Philias’s hearings, it wouldn’t be surprising if they thought it was only for the life of an adventurer.</p>
<p>「Fran, get out of here」</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>Fran frowned and responded by raising me above her head.</p>
<p>「The curse is fully activated.」</p>
<p>「What will happen if it is fully activated?」</p>
<p>「Our country and this village are both for free...」</p>
<p>It seems that Fran and her group had tried to use demon power to destroy the magic stones in order to prevent the full activation of the curse. However, even they could not scratch the magic stones with their own power.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the villagers and the magic stones were magically connected, so magic power could not be stopped from flowing into them even when they were separated from each other.</p>
<p>Since they gathered them in the plaza and restrained them from escaping, it didn’t mean how far away they were from us. However, it seemed that there was no way they could escape from the magic stones just by leaving the village.</p>
<p>From Fran’s story, it was probably going to be activated soon. She didn’t have time to let the villagers go anymore.</p>
<p>(Master)</p>
<p>『Yeah』</p>
<p>Fran couldn’t just run away.</p>
<p>She walked toward the magic stone and held her right hand in front of it. But nothing happened.</p>
<p>「Muh?」</p>
<p>『I knew it, I couldn’t store it properly』</p>
<p>I tried to use dimensional storage to store it somewhere, but that didn’t work.</p>
<p>「Hmph!」</p>
<p>『Doryaaah!』</p>
<p>「......It’s impossible.」</p>
<p>『Yeah』</p>
<p>Fran and I then tried to lift it together, but it didn’t budge. It wasn’t that it was simply too heavy to be lifted, but it seemed to be magically fixed in this place.</p>
<p>「Then... Haaa!」</p>
<p>Fran struck a slash from above on the magic stone. It was a reasonably sharp blow. However, the magic stone did not have a scratch on it. It seemed to have a high defense not only against magic but also against physical attacks.</p>
<p>I actually remember this feeling.</p>
<p>『Do you remember the magic stone weapon that Zelyse had set up to resurrect the great magic beast in the lake?』</p>
<p>(Nn. It was tough.)</p>
<p>『I think it’s the same as that. At the very least, it seems to have been strengthened in a pretty close way』</p>
<p>The flow of magic was very similar, and the smells were the same. Well, I don’t have a nose though. I mean, I think the two processers are the same.</p>
<p>This was just my intuition, but I felt that Zelyse was also involved in this. I don’t know if the magic sword Zelyse had made it a new one or if Zelyse had made it before I died.</p>
<p>Anyway, it would be very difficult to destroy it with the usual way. Well, it would be difficult if it were not for us.</p>
<p>After all, we’ve destroyed it once.</p>
<p>(I won’t let Raydoss do what it wants)</p>
<p>『Yeah! This is where I, the natural enemy of magic stones, come in!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
