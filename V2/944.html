</div><h1>Chapter 944</h1><p>As we looked down at the square from the top of the wall, we saw a group of Hydrangeas and a group of Pine Trees in a carriage ride. As we thought, they were the ones who were in the carriage of the Militant Nation of Hagane. Who was Berserk’s wielder? Both the Hydrangea and Pine Trees? Considering that the wielder will die, it was likely that they had more people they could use. In that case, they were a sacrifice to the Divine Sword huh? I don’t want to involve Fran and these girls too much. Just because they die doesn’t mean that they won’t be able to interact with them. Just because they die doesn’t mean that they will have no point in dealing with them.  In fact, Fran and the hydrangea seemed to be in good compatibility. So, they might be able to become close friends.  But that meant that the pain when they lost their wounds only grew deeper. I didn’t want Fran to get hurt though.  It might be already too late for her to do so.  But in the short period of time that had passed earlier, Fran seemed to feel something like sympathy for the hydrangea.  As I was looking at the carriage with mixed feelings, the troops of the Militant Nation of Hagane began to move. The carriage was slowly moving around with the black spearmen surrounding it.  Apparently, they were planning to pull it up from this square.  Will they be fine if they don’t want to welcome Silard’s troops? Countries that were not on good terms with each other would probably have a fight over such small details. Well, it seems like they were not very good at greeting us, so they decided to pull them up first.  The holy knights of Silard greeted us in the square where the troops of General Hagane had disappeared and were now wider. The holy knights responded with a light wave of their hands, but the most important thing was the Divine Sword Knight Adoll’s movements were dull.  He walked without turning around, dragging his feet slightly.  It must be his last will to walk on his own. No matter how he looks at it, he seems to be exhausted. I’ve heard that it was possible to use the Divine Sword for a long time, so I had assumed on my own that there would be little backlash.  But actually, that was not the case.  It was different from what was possible. If you were willing to use it for a short time and being exhausted, why would you die if you used it for hours?  Adoru was so exhausted that it made me think that.  </p>
<p>(Adoru looks spicy)</p>
<p>『Do you think so too, Fran?』</p>
<p>(Nn.  Is it because it’s too weak to use the Divine Sword?)</p>
<p>『Aah― , I see. That might be true』</p>
<p>  Addle seemed to be prioritizing the acquisition of skills to draw out the best power of her Divine Sword. Even though he was training, there was probably a difference between him and Ashwrath and Isario.  Maybe this is why he can’t withstand the backlash of using the Divine Sword.  Does the country know? If so, is Addler being treated as a single-use magician too?  </p>
<p>『Hmm. In this big country, there might be a lot of dirty truths behind it』</p>
<p>  He might even be making some warriors like Adar to let the next one use his divine sword if he dies. </p>
<p>『I’d like to see Berserk’s activation next time though...』</p>
<p>(... Don’t worry about it)</p>
<p>『I see』</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>  The fact that Berserk was used meant that the hydrangea would die. It was not that he had become friends with them, but he thought that he didn’t want the hydrangea to die after all. As we looked at the admirals from the walls, we heard shrieks. After closer inspection, I saw that several of the civilians were being thrust into a pulpit.  Apparently, they were getting too close to the holy knights.  The holy knights seemed to have a high sense of chosen people, and if the commoners approached them, they would do whatever they wanted. However, the atmosphere here was much more deadly than I had imagined. I could even say that they were emitting killing intent. In fact, not only the holy knights who had thrust the onlookers away, but even the knights around them were putting their hands on the hilts of the sword.  If the civilians move badly, they will be cut off. The presence of the holy knights was so disturbing that they could tell that they were not threatening.  They were trying to intimidate ordinary citizens, as if their enemies were there.  </p>
<p>「W-What are you trying to do!?」</p>
<p>「Silence!  If you get any closer, I’ll cut you down! Get out of here!」</p>
<p>「W-We’re just......」</p>
<p>「We told them to disappear. Was there some purpose for which we have to get some closer?」</p>
<p>  In the end, the holy knights did not soften their attitude, and the frightened onlookers scattered as if they were running away. The holy knights continued to glare at their backs without care.  At first, I thought it was a bit much, but soon they realized the reason for their caution. They were protecting Adoru, who was worn out and dulled by the Divine Sword Release.  He was, after all, a wielder of a Divine Sword.  There was no doubt that he was aiming for his life. I’m sure he has more than a hundred of them, not just the fingers on his hands.  This was the perfect chance to target Addle. They knew this, so they were wary of him.  The reason why the Militant Nation of Hagane had left the plaza was probably to avoid causing a unnecessary commotion with Silard in this state.  It was because the Militant Nation of Hagane might be the most likely to want to save their lives. The Militant Nation of Hagane knew that they were suspected, and so the civilians who had been making a fuss left with a annoyed look on their faces.  The holy knights also had a annoyed look on their faces, but they didn’t apologize. It was because popularity was important, but Adar’s safety was the most important thing. </p>
<p>『We’d better get closer, and also tell them not to get too close to the other adventurers.』</p>
<p>「Okay.」</p>
<p>  They’re going to get into trouble if they get into a fight with a stupid adventurer or a holy knight.If anyone dies, both sides will not be able to retreat.</p>
