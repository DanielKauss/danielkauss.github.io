</div><h1>Chapter 946</h1><p>Even as the old soldiers of the Kingdom of Hagane risk their lives to destroy the antidemons, they spring up later.</p>
<p>An hour later we returned to the bar.</p>
<p>It was just when the town’s guards were starting to relax. The scout’s shouts as he jumped into the bar told me most of the circumstances. The antidemons seemed to be approaching Brutori three times already.</p>
<p>After hearing this, Isario slowly stood up from his bar chair without concealing his dal-like aura.</p>
<p>「Are you going?」</p>
<p>「It can’t be helped. I didn’t have any plans to work this time.」</p>
<p>Fran tilted her head at Isario’s bad old man statement.</p>
<p>「What do you mean?」</p>
<p>「Just because of the scale of the incident doesn’t mean that I expected a third wave. Well, a prediction won’t be foolproof...... But I think there’s a weird number of them in the antidemon season.」</p>
<p>It was difficult to perfectly predict their movements and number since they had an opponent. Still, this was the intuition of an S-Ranked adventurer who had been fighting on this continent for many years.</p>
<p>Maybe this time it really was different from usual. But for now, we’ll have to fight back first.</p>
<p>「You’re going alone?」</p>
<p>「You worry about my uncle, don’t you? Don’t bring him with you, even if he says you want to fight like that」</p>
<p>「Why?」</p>
<p>「Uncle has to do his job too. If you don’t show people how an adventurer with a divine sword can defeat antidemons by himself, you’ll be pissed at by someone important.」</p>
<p>「So fighting alone is my job?」</p>
<p>「That’s right. We have to show them that there are people on this continent who have a divine sword.」</p>
<p>Many people visit and leave the continent of Gordicia. Celebrities and tremendously powerful people, even the owners of the divine swords, famous adventurers, and royalty, come here for battle. However, they never bury their bones on this land.</p>
<p>Because there was no entertainment, no peace, and no honor in Gordicia, there was no reason for her to stay here for a long time. The only people who stayed there were criminals and problem children who could no longer stay on other continents.</p>
<p>That was the fate of Gordicia, the continent of death where the struggle continued for eternity.</p>
<p>However, there are still people living on that continent. Some of them were constantly under the threat of antidemons, but for various reasons, they could only live on this continent.</p>
<p>No matter how many people abandoned this continent, he should be fine as long as Isario was there alone among those people who had no escape. I guess his role was to show them such hope and let them know that they had not been abandoned.</p>
<p>「Okay, he’s coming a little. Aah, you can see it, but don’t get too close, okay? I’ll use a Divine Sword, so I don’t know even if I get burned, okay?」</p>
<p>Isario said all that and left with a pathetic gait.</p>
<p>「She said she wanted to use a Divine Sword」</p>
<p>『Could it be that you’re the type that should involve a lot of people in your advice?』</p>
<p>「Let’s go see it!」</p>
<p>『Yeah. But you get me too close.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>But we had to give them the bare minimum before chasing after Isario. We summoned the adventurers, who had been slacking off after seeing the antidemons defeated, and ordered them to be on guard again.</p>
<p>There were a few adventurers who looked unhappy, thinking that they would be okay now that Isario had come out. To be honest, I knew how they felt.</p>
<p>Even I don’t think Isario would leak out the antidemons either. There would be almost no chance the antidemons would reach this town either.</p>
<p>However, what the dispatched adventurers were expected to do was to show them that they were seriously working. Showing that the Adventurers Guild was doing their job was a true job.</p>
<p>Either way, we couldn’t expose him to the bartender in the middle of a fight.</p>
<p>Diggins took a step forward to counter the adventurers who complained about their drunken and red-faced state. He must have intended to punish them. But Fran decided to take charge of this by herself, with the meaning of tightening.</p>
<p>All we could do now was to intimidate her with her skills and Urushi.</p>
<p>「Grrrrr」</p>
<p>「......Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran obeyed behind the groaning Urushi and activated her intimidation silently. But isn’t she a little strong?</p>
<p>「Hyah!」</p>
<p>「......!」</p>
<p>Not only the intimidated, but even the adventurers around us were sitting on their knees, silently.</p>
<p>It seems that she was a little irritated because she wanted to get back at Isario as soon as possible. That must have put her intimidation in the air. It didn’t give her any good reason.</p>
<p>Leaving Diggins and Urushi to the adventurers who had immediately become obedient, Fran jumped out of Brutori.</p>
<p>「The battle, it’s starting!」</p>
<p>『Yeah! But I haven’t released Ignis yet!』</p>
<p>The antidemon advance party and Isario were just about to clash.</p>
<p>Isario had a distinctive crimson sword in his hand. Ignis the Flame Sword.</p>
<p>As if imitating the shape of a burning flame, the blades on either side of it had been waved, and there were several sharp blades facing the sky. It was Fran Berge.</p>
<p>It seemed that the Divine Sword Release had not yet been reached. Ignis had a dazzling aura from the loss of magic power, but it was not enough to terrify her.</p>
<p>Well, that was probably partly because they were so far away from us.</p>
<p>Isario, holding the divine sword, slowly began to fight the antidemons with his steps. But that was a strange sight.</p>
<p>「Isario, don’t you fight back so hard?」</p>
<p>『Yeah. We’ll just have to take it』</p>
<p>He skillfully used techniques such as parrying, pouring, stopping, and evading to defend against enemy attacks. He threw counters from time to time, but they were not uncommon.</p>
<p>Gradually, the number of enemies continued to increase, and they surrounded everything around us. However, Isario continued to defend against it.</p>
<p>What did she want to do? Gather them and wipe them out? As we were pondering over this, we finally saw a change on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the antidemons around Isario collapsed and disappeared. There was nothing we could do. It was really sudden.</p>
<p>「What do you mean?」</p>
<p>『......I don’t know.』</p>
<p>It was completely different from what I had imagined. It was a quiet, unknown way of fighting.</p>
