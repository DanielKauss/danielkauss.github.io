</div><h1>Chapter 1061</h1><p>Fran was determined to destroy the Raydoss fleet of Dars and jumped out after scraping the shots. </p>
<p>『This fleet doesn’t have a small ship for a sacrifice』</p>
<p> It consisted entirely of large and medium-sized ships. If that was the case, wouldn’t the damage be transferred? In the first place, that was possible because of the Water Dragon’s magic power and Mar’s ability. Wasn’t it impossible with this ordinary fleet that didn’t have either of them? That was what we thought, so we decided to first visit the flagship with a big move. That was what we thought, and decided to give a big move to the flagship first.  </p>
<p>『Fran!  That’s the biggest ship over there! Let’s do it!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  It was the same kind of Kanna Kamui that we unleashed against the water dragonkin at Barbra.  Lightning rained down from the sky on the ship that seemed to be the flagship.  However, a transparent wall suddenly appeared between Kanna Kamui and the ship.  It seemed that there was indeed a barrier.  The transparent wall that we deployed caught the lightning――but it didn’t.  </p>
<p>『Huh?』</p>
<p>「Muh?」</p>
<p>  Kanna Kamui easily smashed through the barrier and landed a direct hit on the ship. With the huge explosion, the pieces of the hull scattered in all directions.  The three masts that the large ship was proud of were disappeared by the lightning, and its hull was shattered from the center. The remaining remains were also slowly sinking into the sea.  The surviving crew members were also affected by the Kanna Kamui’s electric shocks, and they were paralyzed and unable to swim properly. They struggled and could see themselves sinking alongside the rubble.  </p>
<p>『I guess that powerful barrier was thanks to the Water Dragonkin after all』</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p> Even if they were placed on a normal ship, the barrier would not be very effective due to insufficient magic power.  </p>
<p>「... I’ll do it」</p>
<p>『Yeah!』</p>
<p>  Fran’s short words were filled with wary intent that made me laugh. As I thought, her anger for the Raidos Kingdom was probably not over yet.  </p>
<p>「Haaaa!」</p>
<p>『Let’s go!』</p>
<p>  Fran, who was carrying the giant me, jumped on a ship at hand. She held me in her anti-ship mode above her head and swung me down to the ship below us.  Surprisingly, there was almost no sound of fracturing. The sound of light rustling of the wood against each other was heard, and a large trench was drilled into the sea.  The ship was probably divided into front and rear before the opponent could understand. A split second later, the fire rose from the cut section and the hull flared.  In addition to their anti-ship mode, they also used attribute swords and flames. While the crew members’ screams began to echo, the battle ship sank into the sea with astonishment.  From there, it was time for an invasion.  Fran flew around in the air and gradually cut the ship in half. Some ships had their torso cut in half, others were divided into left and right sides.  The Raidos fleet was engulfed in flames, sinking one after another.  By the standards of this world, the Raidos naval ship was not weak. It looked like a wooden sail ship, but its strength, speed, and handling were all strengthened by magic tools.  Even if it wasn’t a modern battle ship, it was supposed to be as good as an old cruiser.  Moreover, it was loaded with several magic cannons with high accuracy. If we consider that number of thirty ships, it would be considered to be one of the strongest class fleets aside from the Water Dragon ship.  However, Fran was much more capable.  Smaller, faster, and with better evasive performance. And yet, it could fire consecutive shots with super attack power that could destroy a ship with a single blow.  I imagined it as if we were using a ship with decent modern performance against the human-type mobile weapons that appear in science fiction. There was no way she could win that.  I was wary of Marl’s secret measures against strong opponents, but there was no sign of him coming out.  After about 100 ships were sunk, Fran seemed to have realized that she couldn’t do anything.  Some ships began to run away. But they couldn’t escape.  </p>
<p>「Master! Please over there!」</p>
<p>『Okay!』</p>
<p>  Fran was ahead of herself and destroyed the ship that was running first.  </p>
<p>「Gyaaaaah!  Kiaa!」</p>
<p>「No!」</p>
<p>「Black Devil Mea!」</p>
<p> The crew members of the ship, who had been cut in half as they passed each other, screamed and fell to the sea.  Without caring about those men at all, Fran ran towards the next ship. If Fran approached the ship, the ship would be cut in half and the hull would flare up.  It was only a nightmare for the enemy. Besides, it must have been a sign of Fran’s high killing intent.  A more violent barrage began to focus on Fran. However, they could not get hit, and in just 100 minutes, another 100 ships were being sunk. It was at the same time for each ship.  However, it seemed that her bloodlust had become cold, and her obsession for slashing directly with her own hands had eased.  </p>
<p>「Let’s clear it up with magic. Master, please over there」</p>
<p>『Okay』</p>
<p>  We fired a series of magic attacks and cleaned up the remaining ships at once. After about 20 minutes from the start of the battle, all enemy ships disappeared with the debris of the sea.  To win, we won’t be able to do anything, but one question remained. The same went for Barbra, but Raidos’ ship did not try to fry the white flag at all.  I’ve heard from Brunen in Belioth that there was a white flag culture in this world. I wonder if he had the determination and pride that he doesn’t just give up on anything.  </p>
<p>「Phew.  I won.」</p>
<p>『Ou!』</p>
<p>「Those who are now trapped, I’m going to go help you!」</p>
<p>『Are you going to go quickly?  Wouldn’t it be better to take a break?』</p>
<p>  We won the battle unscathed, but both our magic and physical strength were exhausted. As expected, we had to attack it seriously to sink such a huge ship, and we were too excited to adjust our pace......  It was completely unsteady and was moving at a high pace. However, Fran wiped the sweat from her forehead and turned her gaze to the town of Dars.</p>
<p>『Well, you’re right』</p>
