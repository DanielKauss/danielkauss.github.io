</div><h1>Chapter 1021</h1><p>Ashwrath, Mea, and Fran attacked the giant antidemons, attracted their attention. Even the giant antidemons, who had been ignoring us until a little while ago, could not seem to ignore them. They attacked us as well. In the meantime, they were making steady preparations for a counterattack under Orfalve’s command. Until a moment ago, Jayne had planned to retreat by herself, but now that Ashwrath had come, things have changed. Up until a moment ago, they had planned to retreat with Jayne’s power, but things had changed with Ashwrath’s arrival.  With him in the lead, they slammed down the huge antidemons with the entire army.  That’s all part of the deal.  Now that we’ve got the purple barrier, we know that we can’t escape.  Come to think of it, most of the top forces on this continent are concentrated in this area.  The divine swordsmanship in particular is Ashwrath, Mea, Sophie, Adorr, and Hydrangea. Well, Mea’s Lind and the hydrangea’s Berserk were not allowed to enter the fray, and Adoru was not.  Even so, just having two divine swords open to the public was plenty of exceptional.Even so, just having two divine swords open to the public was plenty of exceptional.  In addition, the Seven Sages, Orfalve and Jayne, were joined by powerful individuals such as Hilt, Fran, Seliadot, Quina, Zefmate, and Chelsea.  Things are simple.  First, when Orfalve and Jayne form a formation, Ashwrath leaves the decoy group.  He releases Gaia to gain more power.  Meanwhile, Fran and Jayne gain time to die and leave at Ashwrath’s signal. We unleashed Gaia’s strongest move on the giant antidemon, and if we couldn’t defeat it, everyone else attacked with all our might.  That was our strategy, but......  </p>
<p>「Tch!  The big monsters are starting to make strange moves.」</p>
<p>「Such magic!」</p>
<p> The huge antidemons, who had been firing magic bullets around chasing Ashwrath, suddenly stopped moving.  They didn’t move at all.  However, I could see a tremendous change taking place inside them.  Both magic and evil energy were increasing in intensity and gathering in the center of their bodies. At the same time, the amount of magic power flowing out of the Abyss Eater increased.  It could be said to be doubled. However, it was compressed in the center of the sphere from the edge of the giant antidemon’s body.  It wasn’t only Ashwrath but we were also going to attack it with all our might. I would have been happy if we could interfere with the compression of our magic power...  But the outer shell was shattered and our body disappeared, but we couldn’t scratch the center of it.  It seems that the compressed super magic acted as a barrier.  Even Ashwrath’s land magic only cracked a little. He must have been able to attack it with all his might, just like the Evil God Slayer that Adoll had unleashed.  Realizing this, Ashwrath held up his Divine Sword and shouted.Realizing this, Ashwrath held up his divine sword and shouted.  </p>
<p>「Divine Sword Release!」</p>
<p>  Gaia transformed into a strange appearance, similar to a huge hammer.  After witnessing the magic power of the Earth Sword Gaia at this close range, I once again realized how great the Divine Sword was.  There was a frustrated and reliable super weapon in there.  However, the presence that the giant antidemons emitted was not as strong as that of the Divine Sword. It seemed that we couldn’t be relieved at all.  </p>
<p>「Fran, get away!  Doraaaaaah!」</p>
<p>  Ashwrath stepped forward and swung down Gaia. Even if the sword hadn’t reached them, an invisible force field attacked the giant antidemon.  Its super huge body was crushed by an invisible force from directly above and slammed into the ground. The earth sank deeply, and cracks a few meters high even ran around it.  </p>
<p>「Nrgh......」</p>
<p>「Urooourgh!」</p>
<p>  Ashwrath gritted his teeth and put more strength into his hands, gripping the sword. His hands and Gaia trembled, and I could feel that they were sometimes pushed back. The giant antidemons, on the other hand, let out a high-pitched scream as their magic power was released into the surrounding area.  The super gravity field maintained by Ashwrath distorted the scenery, and the super-high concentration of magic power that the giant antidemons released was surrounding their huge bodies like lightning bolts. The area around it had been turned into a place of death that no one could enter.  And then, a huge explosion occurred.  The power of the two opposing sides then blown away. Even Fran, who had been in a hurry, was blown away by the shockwave.  She managed to catch Fran, who was rolling on the ground, with her telekinesis and healed her wounds with magic. Fragments of antidemons that flew like scattered bullets pierced through the barrier and wounded Fran.  </p>
<p>『Are you okay!?』</p>
<p>(... I’m fine)</p>
<p>  The damage was great, but it seemed that it was not enough to knock her out. Fran stood up slowly, wiping the blood around her eyes.  Her friends, who had similar eyes to Fran’s, managed to survive. But are you okay with Ashwrath at the center of the blast zone?  </p>
<p>『Ashwrath is......  he’s stuck at all!』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>  Perhaps because he had put up a barrier, the unharmed Ashwrath stood on the ground.  He looked up to the sky and narrowed his eyes. As I followed his gaze, I saw a bean-like point far above us.  It seemed to be a giant antidemon. To my surprise, it seemed to have used the release of magic power to jump up.  A huge crater had been created in the place where the antidemons were originally. From the depth of the crater, it could be seen that it was a tremendous explosion of power.  Did they escape?  No, that’s not the case.  </p>
<p>「Guys!  Retreat!  Full throttle!」</p>
<p>  Ashwrath shouted.  Immediately afterward, the giant antidemons began to dive. Behind them, the magic power released began to shimmer.  It looked like a shooting star.  His way of thinking was probably that of the Heavenly Sword Drawing Technique Fran used.  It was a super-powerful attack that combined both falling and magic release energy. Fran used slashes, while the giant antidemons used blows to hit her with their own weight. From Ashwrath’s impatient look, the danger must be enormous.  </p>
<p>『Fran!  Let’s get out of here! You’re just holding Ashwrath back even after we get here!』</p>
<p>(......Okay.)</p>
<p>  Behind Fran, who nodded in frustration as she ran off, I could feel the magical power of the divine attribute emanating from her.  Ashwrath seemed to be planning to intercept her.  </p>
<p>『We’ll have to get some more distance!』</p>
<p>My danger detection skills continued to react in an extraordinary way.</p>
