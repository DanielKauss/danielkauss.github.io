</div><h1>Chapter 1100</h1><p>「Y-yeah...」</p>
<p>「This is a mansion...」</p>
<p>Baron Noare and the maids then glanced in astonishment.</p>
<p>It was blocked by a huge wall, so we wouldn’t be able to see in detail what was inside. But we should have seen a thunderbolt spell pouring down, and a huge thunderbolt at the end.</p>
<p>There were intense flashes of light emitted from the top of the barrier many times over.</p>
<p>However, Fran looked unhappy. I guess it was because there was still no sign of the owner of that presence. There was a hint of hiding, but I couldn’t find it.</p>
<p>『You still want to try it?』</p>
<p>「I’ll do it!」</p>
<p>Fran, who was still stubborn, fired a series of more magic attacks. She thought that thunder magic would not work, and this time she used flame magic.</p>
<p>Countless spears of flames poured down on the mansion many times. The mansion, which had been in a state of half-destruction, had been completely destroyed. The remaining parts were also burned.</p>
<p>And that was not the only technique that Fran unleashed. She was sandwiching Area Purification, a new magic she had learned from learning Holy Magic.</p>
<p>I guess they should be keeping in mind that the person they were hiding from was an undead.</p>
<p>And that made it possible for us to overcome the situation.</p>
<p>「Gyaaaaaah!」</p>
<p>「There’s something there!」</p>
<p>『Yeah. My presence suddenly started to thicken! It’s undead!』</p>
<p>Suddenly, a powerful undead appeared inside the walls, probably no longer hidden by Saintess Magic.</p>
<p>The robe I wore was tattered, but it looked like a magic tool too. My appraisal revealed that it was a very powerful concealment magic tool. However, it was half burned by Fran’s flame magic, and most of the effects were gone.</p>
<p>Flame magic seemed to have some effect too.</p>
<p>『And its combat power is lower than I thought it would be. Its name is Hydeman』</p>
<p>Does she mean how good she is at hiding? I agree that she was a specialist in stealth, possessing skills such as stealth, presence blocking, thinning, and translucent, as well as skills for hiding and shadow transfer. In addition, she even had a unique skill called Existence Cloaking.</p>
<p>In addition to his own abilities, he even had a robe to support it, which would give him tremendous stealth abilities.</p>
<p>I think Fran had spent most of her magic time diving in the shadows, but she couldn’t seem to be able to prevent the wide area purification even in the shadows. Then, she appeared after being exposed to flames when she emerged from the shadows.</p>
<p>「Guh...... You little girl! You did it for me!」</p>
<p>「Are you a spy for the Kingdom of Raidos?」</p>
<p>「......Hmph.」</p>
<p>Hydman didn’t answer Fran’s question and turned away. No, I guess he was looking for an opening to escape while making such a gesture.</p>
<p>「Urushi」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>He tried to use Shadow Migration to escape, but it was immediately stopped by Urushi. Urushi had appeared from the shadow before he could even dive into it.</p>
<p>She could not use the shadow that another person was using. If she was going to use it, it would require more magic and interference than the opponent. As a result, Hydman failed to teleport. Even though it was a high-level undead, it was no match for Urushi.</p>
<p>A Hydman can reach as high as Urushi’s headbutt from below.</p>
<p>Fran rushed over and slashed off his limbs, grabbed his head tightly and captured him. Since he was undead, I didn’t feel any pain or suffocation, but it didn’t matter.</p>
<p>「Purification.」</p>
<p>「Gyaaah!」</p>
<p>「Purification.」</p>
<p>「Gyiahh!」</p>
<p>The undead should have no pain receptor, but it must be painful to be cleansed.</p>
<p>This had unintentionally become a substitute for torture. Hydman looked exhausted as his body was weakened by cleansing magic and suffering that he had never felt before.</p>
<p>Hydman looked like a completely dry mummy, but his expression moved slightly. That allowed him to somehow read my emotions.</p>
<p>Well, it was still a bit harsh, but I had gotten some information from the Principle of Falsehoods.</p>
<p>This guy was an executives of the Black Skeleton Corps of the Raidos Kingdom and seemed to have come here in pursuit of Derick. However, the prison guards in the royal castle were so solid that he had lurked in Baron Noare’s house to see how they went.</p>
<p>Wasn’t this quite dangerous? If the transfer of delicates was a little later, we might have been taken back by Hydman.</p>
<p>We rushed to the royal capital using Urushi’s legs at once, but how did he catch up with us? I thought it was a tool for long-distance teleportation, but I was wrong.</p>
<p>He seemed to have just been able to run through while concealing his presence. That was probably possible only because he was an undead, so he didn’t feel fatigue and had very little presence.</p>
<p>After all the interrogation so far, she must have realized that a lot of things had leaked out. Hydman was moaning in frustration.</p>
<p>「I never thought I would get any information out of me...... Hydeman, Sixth seat of the Black Skeleton Corps, The Extreme of Pain......」</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>『Fran! Cut it!』</p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>A tremendous amount of magic power then gushed out from Hydman’s head. It was probably comparable to Extreme Magic. I don’t know what was about to be activated, but it was definitely not something that should be avoided.</p>
<p>We judged that and attacked Hydeman. Fran’s slash sliced the Hydeman in a cross, and my flame magic ashes at his head.</p>
<p>『So you managed to stop it......?』</p>
<p>「Nn...」</p>
<p>It seems the head had a built-in magic tool that caused a huge explosion. Maybe it was a self-determining device that allowed him to annihilate the surrounding enemies and seal his mouth.</p>
<p>In the end, she failed to keep Hydeman in her custody... Fran frowned in frustration as she stared at the remains of Hydeman who had fallen into the mansion.</p>
<p>But that didn’t mean we didn’t get anything out of it.</p>
<p>『I heard that the Southern Duke is going to make some big move. Let me tell the rest of the country about it』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Well, I’m sure Esmeralda heard about it through the sand anyway.</p>
