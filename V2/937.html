</div><h1>Chapter 937</h1><p>「Die! Yaaah!」</p>
<p>「He won’t die, you know?」</p>
<p>「Shit! Just a little bit!」</p>
<p>「Give me a shit!」</p>
<p> Even when the battle began, Isario did not draw his weapon. Instead, he did not attack them and continued to evade their attacks. Isario laughed and dodged Zelos Reed’s axe and his friend’s sword with a paper-thin margin. It was a light gesture, but it was not so surprising. Fran could do the same thing. Even Fran could do the same.  But his face was still the same.  He had a reddened face and a very irritated look on his face. I was watching him, so he must be even more irritated.  On the other hand, Zbarb continued to heat up.  Even though his head was covered with blood, his movements did not lose their sharpness. He said he was Rank C, but his combat power was close to Rank B.  </p>
<p>「Hey!  Die! Shitgaa!」</p>
<p>「Come on, I think I’ll get a hit in a little while.  Come on, do your best, young man.」</p>
<p>「Chush!」</p>
<p>  Finally, Zelos Reed used his martial arts.  An axe glistened in white with the ki he wore was sent out to the side. Then, for the first time, Isario made a move other than evasion.  He then put his hand on the divine sword at his waist.  I thought he might finally be able to see the divine sword, but his expectations were betrayed. Isario did not draw it.  He lifted up his entire sheath and caught the axe with its hilt.  As expected of a divine sword. The hilt also seemed to be of a different level of strength.  Zbarb, who had easily caught a blow with his all his might, scrunched up his face. It was hard to believe that the killing technique he had performed with confidence was blocked by the hilt.  </p>
<p>「You understand your differences in power, don’t you? </p>
<p>「A-Don’t you fucking play dumb with me! What kind of petite did you want me to use!?」</p>
<p> Well, the man came all the way here to defeat an S ranker. There was no way he could back down quietly by this.  But he was petty.  I’m not a small fry that could see what he’s capable of...  It seemed that they couldn’t make proper decisions because of the blood in their heads.  From then on, they spit out their axes like crazy.  Their friends had already stopped, looking puzzled. It seemed that their hearts had been broken by the fact that they understood the difference in abilities.  </p>
<p>「Uryah, yeah!」</p>
<p>「Yo-holy」</p>
<p>「Nugaaaaah!」</p>
<p>「Hahaha, you’ve got too much power!」</p>
<p>「Guooooh!」</p>
<p>  The two were so passionate that Zelos Reed felt a little sorry for them.  It wasn’t just me, the other adventurers also seemed to have started thinking so. They were watching over Zelos Reed with a subtle expression on their face.  Zelos Reed must have been even more irritated.  </p>
<p>「I’m the one who has to do this, Zelos Reed!  The best thing in the town of Reeduga! Don’t make fun of me!」</p>
<p>「If you don’t want to be made fun of, I’ll do even more. Come on, see you」</p>
<p>  Isario was handling his attacks in his same condition as before. He sometimes dodged, sometimes even blocked, and wouldn’t let him snatch at us.  I think he could dodge all of Isario’s attacks, but why was he even attacking us on purpose? As I observed the questioning, I finally understood the meaning of Isario’s movements. It seemed that he had evaded ordinary attacks and only took powerful martial arts that might cause damage to his surroundings, to cancel out the shockwaves.  From the residue of the flying magic power, I could tell that it was an advanced martial art that Zelyse was unleashing. If released normally, it would probably inflict serious injuries on the spectators.  Isario’s lightheartedness made it seem simple, but he was doing very advanced things.  First of all, his tremendous evasive power.  And his ability to not lose to an axe. His ability to see through the details of the techniques.  His ability to move quickly, and his ability to shock others.  All of this would have been impossible without having a high level of equipment.  </p>
<p>(Amazing.)</p>
<p>『Yeah. That’s, even Fran will be able to do it』</p>
<p>(... It’s difficult)</p>
<p> I’m not saying it’s impossible because Fran hates to lose, but it’s certainly gonna be quite difficult.  Zvalve was also doing a lot of hard work, but after five minutes, his movements began to slow down.  Then, the battle suddenly ended.  </p>
<p>「Guh, Gah...?」</p>
<p>「Yes, it’s over! You’ll get tired of being an uncle again, okay?」</p>
<p>「Wha-...?」</p>
<p>  Zelos Reed’s leg suddenly stopped, and his huge body collapsed in front of him. From the way he breathed violently, we could tell that he had run out of strength.  He was probably too focused on offense to know his condition. Perhaps Isario had done something bad, but we didn’t know what it was.  </p>
<p>「You guys, take him in, huh?  I’m glad you don’t pick a fight with him anymore, if at all possible. I’ll have him go on a bit of a pain next time, okay?」</p>
<p>「Hiii!  I-I understand!」</p>
<p>「He won’t show up in front of you anymore! So forgive me!」</p>
<p>「In the end, the intimidated children of Isario dragged Zelos Reed into the middle of it and left. Those guys were lucky enough to have such an entire army of Rank S adventurers.  </p>
<p>「Hey!  I’m having a mock battle with you!」</p>
<p>「Noo!」</p>
<p>「Why?  Why? I fought him!」</p>
<p>「You’ll get tired if you fight a girl as strong as Miss Hilt, right?」</p>
<p> I guess Hilt could defeat the guy without getting tired.  </p>
<p>「Muh」</p>
<p>「Then Uncle will have a meeting with the guildmaster, so I’ll be going now.  See ya」</p>
<p>「Nn...」</p>
<p>  In the end, the only thing we could do was to let Isario go while waving her hands. One of the adventurers called out to Fran as if to comfort her. </p>
<p>「Having your Red lotus-edged husband say that much is amazing meat girl!」</p>
<p>「Guh?」</p>
<p>「You don’t know him, huh? </p>
<p>「Isn’t he a genius?」</p>
<p>「Aah, that one」</p>
<p>  The adventurer smiled bitterly as he told us about Isario. Apparently, when he first became an adventurer, he was ridiculed for not having the talent of the sword and was called as a genius. Even though he got stronger and ascended to S rank, for some reason, he called his nickname as an alias.  </p>
<p>「That person looks decent and is a high-ranking adventurer.  Well, it’s normal. He’s not a bad person, you know?」</p>
<p>「Hmm」</p>
