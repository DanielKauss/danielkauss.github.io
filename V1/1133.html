</div><h1>Chapter 1133</h1><p>The battlefield was chaotic.</p>
<p>The Kranzel Knights, adventurers, and nobles were all engaged in a fierce exchange with the undead and red armored knights.</p>
<p>So, this was the battlefield, huh?</p>
<p>This was the first time I had seen a large-scale battlefield where people were fighting against each other.</p>
<p>Even in this world, where one-sided slaughter by the strong is possible, there are clashes between soldiers. In the first place, not many soldiers are strong enough to control the battlefield by themselves.</p>
<p>Kranzel and Raidos were big powers that were very active in recruiting people for the martial arts tournament. That was why they were so special.</p>
<p>Besides, it’s not something we could just beat up and win against.</p>
<p>War is designed to take over an enemy’s territory. Even if they successfully cut down an enemy’s territory, it would be difficult for a single strong person to control multiple villages and towns.</p>
<p>That would require a lot of soldiers. In order to get rid of the soldiers from the enemy countries, we had to prepare a lot of soldiers as well.</p>
<p>There were also the faces of nobles and those in power. War was also a stage for them to reap achievements.</p>
<p>If the only forces left to the strongest were the warriors, the nobles would not be able to make any achievements. As a result, although they were pitiful to the soldiers, they were dragged onto the battlefield as forces that the nobles could use.</p>
<p>There were quite a few mercenaries among the soldiers brought in by the nobles, but they were being pushed by the undead. There were also many poison users and regeneration users, so they must be having a hard time here.</p>
<p>Inside it were undead specialized in the production of undead known as the “Scavengers” created by the Black Skeleton Army, and they were continuing to create an army like Jean.</p>
<p>But the worse one would be the red knight in front of us.</p>
<p>But as usual, they were strong without any fancy tricks. Adventurers were being pushed back, causing considerable damage. If Forrund hadn’t attracted the enemy’s main forces, they would have already been annihilated.</p>
<p>After all, the magician who acted as the enemy commander was so strong that he could clash head-on with the Forrund of the Hundred Swords.</p>
<p>We would channel the volunteer soldiers to support the adventurers, and Urushi, Fran, and I would work with Forrund to defeat that commander. Maybe we could then move on to eliminating the undead?</p>
<p>When we were discussing with Fran, there was a significant change in the battlefield. A white light radiated from Donadrond, the demonkin leading the adventurers.</p>
<p>The light that enveloped the adventurers’ bodies seemed to have the power to heal and protect them. They suddenly seemed to have gotten stronger.</p>
<p>『This is our chance!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>We then started to move.</p>
<p>「Hey, he’s not going to die」</p>
<p>「Huh! What is it, my priestess!?」</p>
<p>「But what if I told you there was a way to defeat those scavengers?」</p>
<p>「Understood! That’s really a pathetic display!」</p>
<p>「We’re gonna help the adventurers!」</p>
<p>「「「Yeah!」」」</p>
<p>The warriors rushed into the battlefield in unison and attacked the red knights at once. Fran led the way and launched an attack at their commander.</p>
<p>Fran’s black lightning struck the commander and succeeded in astonishing him. He didn’t seem to have taken any damage, but it certainly slowed his movements. In addition, Urushi’s shadow magic surrounded the surrounding red knights and blocked their movements.</p>
<p>「That’s a surprise attack!」</p>
<p>In the meantime, Fran approached Forrund and healed her wounds.</p>
<p>「Forrund! Are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Y-yeah」</p>
<p>「My priestess! Leave the undead to me!」</p>
<p>「Nn. Please」</p>
<p>They seemed agitated to see the Genoside Ghouls that Fran was accompanying, but I won’t give them a briefing later!</p>
<p>「Forrund! Bring it all together!」</p>
<p>「Yeah」</p>
<p>「What the hell! You!」</p>
<p>The young man, who exclaimed in hatred as he unleashed flame magic, was the vice-commander of the Crimson Flame Knights, one of the six Red Knight Orders. Yes, he was their vice-commander.</p>
<p>The leader of the group said that they remained in the fort to control the treasure from which the name of the Crimson Flame Knights came. The effect of the treasure was simple: increase the power of flame magic under him and his subordinates, increase the resistance to flame, and enhance his physical strength. In addition, it was also possible to greatly enhance the effect by narrowing down the target.</p>
<p>『First up is the vice-commander!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「Die! Die! Why don’t you die!」</p>
<p>I used magic to create a barrier to block the flames and canceled them out.</p>
<p>Drulay was the vice-commander of the group, and despite his personality, he was a very skilled flame magic user. Even though he has been enhanced, there are not many people who can activate such magic multiple times already.</p>
<p>But I’m also confident that it can activate magic at the same time.</p>
<p>Fran, Forrund, and Urushi closed the distance while I was blocking the vice-commander’s flame magic. The red knights tried to protect the vice-commander, but the stepfathers were in their way.</p>
<p>「Leave it to me!」</p>
<p>「I won’t let the captain get in my way!」</p>
<p>「Nice job.」</p>
<p>When Fran called out to them, the warriors nodded happily. They had been looking back at her for a long time.</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Hmph, you got me!」</p>
<p>『Oi oi, what do you want to do today?』</p>
<p>It reminded me that I could now control the evil energy of my opponent with Evil Spirit Conquest. I wonder if my Great Magician skill could interfere with their magic?</p>
<p>Then the effect was immediately apparent.</p>
<p>「Wha......! My body!」</p>
<p>Like I thought, it was more difficult to control than powerful magic. If it got in the way, it would be difficult to keep using it.</p>
<p>『Now!』</p>
<p>「Yes!」</p>
<p>「Teyaa!」</p>
<p>As if to respond to my words, Forrund and Fran slashed at her at once.</p>
<p>「Kuh――argh......!」</p>
<p>There was no way the two super masters could evade their slashes without magic, and the vice-commander was sliced open his head and head, falling to the ground splattering blood everywhere.</p>
