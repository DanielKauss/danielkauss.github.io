</div><h1>Chapter 919</h1><p>Sophie and Urushi appeared alongside a group of people.</p>
<p>Her song――or rather, their song covered the entire battlefield. It was an adventurer’s song sung by thousands of people.</p>
<p>Space? The air? Anyway, the entire battlefield slowly healed Fran and Mea’s wounds, emitting a faint golden light as if in response to the song.</p>
<p>I ignored the effects of the divine attribute as well, and me, Fran, and Mea were beginning to recover. I guess it was due to this magical power that possessed the divine attribute.</p>
<p>It seemed that the backlash of using the divine attribute was being healed by the divine attribute.</p>
<p>The antidemons, on the other hand, stopped moving in confusion. With their entire body enveloped in powerful magic power, they seemed to have no idea what to do next.</p>
<p>It must be the same as when the artificial intelligence was bugging in an unexpected situation and stopping its movement. That was happening all over the battlefield. The range of effects was terrifying.</p>
<p>「Sophie! Urushi!」</p>
<p>「I’m sorry for being late! But I’ve brought you a strong reinforcement!」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>Many people were standing behind Sophie and Charon as they smiled. What they were wearing was normal clothes. Some of them were wearing armor on top of it, but most of them were just wearing pots.</p>
<p>They had a wide variety of weapons, including rusted spears and swords, as well as pans and horned materials. Moreover, they were not wearing them at all.</p>
<p>They were ordinary citizens by any stretch of the imagination.</p>
<p>But he had a brave expression on his face as he lined up behind Sophie. I couldn’t help but feel a strange sense of confidence just by looking at him.</p>
<p>There were so many people willing to stand on the battlefield with us. That fact was important.</p>
<p>『Well done, Urushi! I’ll reward you later!』</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>But it was not the only one who caught my attention. Fran looked around Sophie and tilted her head.</p>
<p>「Sophie, what’s that?」</p>
<p>「My...... partner, I guess?」</p>
<p>Countless instruments were floating around Sophie as she smiled at her. Some were key instruments, string instruments, and percussion instruments. Some of them looked unclear, so I’d say there were probably almost thirty in total.</p>
<p>The ability to control instruments? However, all the instruments were emitting tremendous magic power. combined with all of them, they would far exceed me.</p>
<p>It wasn’t an ordinary magic tool. Could it be the Earth Sword Gaia that released the closest magic power I’ve ever seen? However, there was no intimidating atmosphere to it.</p>
<p>No, wait a second. Isn’t this instrument emitting a slight divine attribute? Immediately after I realized that, Sophie mentioned the true identity of the instrument.</p>
<p>「It’s called the Oracle. The Divine Sword...... The Saintess Sword.」</p>
<p>『Huh?! A-A Divine Sword?』</p>
<p>I quickly appraised the dragonkin, and it definitely said “Oratrio”.</p>
<p>Name: Saintess Sword, Oracle</p>
<p>ATK: 1000</p>
<p>Mana Conductivity: SS</p>
<p>[Skill]</p>
<p>Super Effect Boost, Instability to Summon instruments, Super-strengthening of choir effects, Super-expansion of effect, Steel Thread Strengthening, Steel Thread Manipulation, Divine Finger, Super Awakening, Simultaneous Performance, Unknown.</p>
<p>I couldn’t see everything in its body. But I could tell that it was an exceptional sword. It had less offensive power than the Earth Sword Gaia I had seen before, but I would have to say that it was an instrument.</p>
<p>Rather, it had a thousand of them, and how would they attack me? How would they be treated as a dull vessel? Also, its magic conductivity would be a magnitude lower than that.</p>
<p>As a Divine Sword, it had low attack power and magic conductivity, but it also possessed 10,000 higher magic power than Gaia.</p>
<p>The versatility of her skills combined with her strength made her a Divine Sword, just like Gaia’s. This was certainly a Divine Sword.</p>
<p>「Divine sword?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. I had forgotten about it a while ago, but I remembered」</p>
<p>The time I checked Sophie’s stats before.■■■■ There was a part called “■”, that says “Divine Sword Release” skill was in it.</p>
<p>What we couldn’t see was not her hiding it, but Sophie herself losing her memory.</p>
<p>「I’m sure there’s a lot I want to ask you, but for now, let’s fight the antidemons!」</p>
<p>「Nn. Okay」</p>
<p>「Fuhahaha! I never thought you would have a divine sword! I’m counting on you!」</p>
<p>「Saintess-sama, she had a divine sword...... Amazing.」</p>
<p>Now we had enough time to talk to Mea and Velmeria too. Sophie spoke to these girls with serious looks on her face.</p>
<p>「The antidemons have stopped moving, but I’m going to get used to it and start moving right away. So, I’d like to use my strongest move yet...」</p>
<p>「She’s not an oratorio?」</p>
<p>「Maybe it’s Oratrio’s power that amplified the power of my magic song?」</p>
<p>It seems Sophie had the ability to write her own music and create new magic songs. She could also manipulate the music of existing ordinary songs and turn it into magic songs.</p>
<p>In that case, the emotions contained in the song could affect the song, an effect not even Sophie could imagine.</p>
<p>「I transformed an adventurer’s song into a magical song」</p>
<p>「That song was healing me a while ago, you know?」</p>
<p>「It doesn’t matter if there are different songs in the same song, right? Besides, the song was designed to heal me a little while ago, but that’s not the true power of that song」</p>
<p>Sophie was going to write a new magic song that was the same song but with a different effect.</p>
<p>「The thoughts contained in the adventurer’s song are support and encouragement」</p>
<p>「Yeah. My newly created magic song has the power to awaken and awaken the power that lies in the blood and souls of my comrades」</p>
<p>It seems this was going to be a song that would give someone Potential Release.</p>
<p>「But the intensity of the people’s thoughts contained in this song was beyond my imagination. I don’t know how much power it will exert」</p>
<p>I’m sure that Fran and Urushi will be greatly strengthened. However, I couldn’t even imagine how much of a burden that would be placed on them.</p>
<p>「You may not need to sleep for a few days. Is that all right?」</p>
<p>To be honest, I was a bit worried, but everyone knew that we would have to rely on that song to fight the antidemons right now.</p>
<p>「Nn. Okay」</p>
<p>「Don’t worry!」</p>
<p>「Understood」</p>
<p>「If you want a young lady...」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>All of them nodded immediately.</p>
<p>「......Then I’ll go. I’ll leave this city to you――No, that’s not it. Let’s all protect it!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Sophie took out a harp from the oratorio and started playing it. The song was the adventurer’s song from earlier. I guess the magic power contained in it was more important than the song itself.</p>
<p>「We are adventurers~...♪ The golden adventurers~...♪」</p>
<p>「No foe shall make us falter!」</p>
<p>In response to Sophie’s song, the people sang a song again. They were getting used to it, and soon everyone raised their voices.</p>
<p>Singing voices seemed to seep into us as well.</p>
<p>『Somehow, I’m starting to love this song』</p>
<p>(Me too.)</p>
<p>I felt better. But that was not all.</p>
<p>「I can feel your power!」</p>
<p>So, this was the power of Oracle’s skill!</p>
<p>I could feel that the aura emanating from Fran had suddenly increased. Such pressure...... I was reminded of Ashwrath and Weena Rhyn.</p>
<p>Moreover, wouldn’t the power of the Divine Attribute have increased little by little?</p>
<p>「Ugh......!」</p>
<p>『Fran! Are you okay!?』</p>
<p>Fran grunted bitterly. In the midst of it, I could see that the mana was raging like crazy. Now that it’s with the song! Thanks to Sophie, my strength and mana have recovered, but is this still a heavy burden?</p>
<p>「So, this is what makes power......?」</p>
<p>『Fran?』</p>
<p>「Master, I understand......! I can get a word out of my mouth!」</p>
<p>Fran muttered to me as if she was being heated.</p>
<p>「O raging power of the Divine Beast that lies in my blood...」</p>
<p>I had never heard a word like that before, but it came out of Fran’s mouth.</p>
<p>「Awaken! Divine Beast Form!」</p>
<p>With Fran’s firm words, an enormous amount of Divine Attribute-based magic power then erupted from her body.</p>
