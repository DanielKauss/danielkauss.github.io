</div><h1>Chapter 918</h1><p>「Saintess-sama, let’s go with you! Your friends are doing their best, aren’t they? I’ll save you!」</p>
<p>「Yes...... Yes!」</p>
<p> This city wasn’t just a mess. Along with the people gathered, we ran off. It wasn’t just the warmth of Urushi standing beside us, I could feel a lot of breathing on his back. He was no longer heartless or desperate. So many people had stood up for Sendia and Fran’s sake. But so many people, who shouldn’t have the power to fight, stood up for Sendia and Fran’s sake. When I thought about it, I was about to cry differently than before.  When I looked back, they all looked prepared.  They knew that they might die. Still, they were trying to fight.  I wouldn’t let them do anything rash.  I’ll give it my all. I will use all my strength to do anything.  But it was just right after I decided that.  The magic string Lauda, who was sitting at her waist, trembled. It was as if it had taken my life.  I couldn’t help but pick up Lauda and――.  </p>
<p>「Aah―」</p>
<p>  I remembered.  Why had I forgotten about it.  Spicy, painful, the memories of that day.  No, that was why I had forgotten about it? Or was it because this girl had made me forget?  But I remembered.  The power of the magic string Lauda that killed my foster father. </p>
<p>「Urushi, let’s run」</p>
<p>「Woof?」</p>
<p>「Don’t worry.  I won’t leave everyone behind.」</p>
<p>  Was it because she remembered Lauda’s true power?  The sound emitted from the lightly played strings was more clear than ever. This sound gave me more power than ever before.  Naturally, my fingers played the song. I could feel that the people behind me had gained strength from the magic song.  </p>
<p>「S-Saintess-sama?  This is......?」</p>
<p>「Let’s run! Now you guys can run!」</p>
<p>  I jumped on Urushi’s back.  Then Urushi took my will and ran off with great force. Of course, no normal person would be able to keep up with the speed of his legs.  But everyone was strengthened by me now. His legs, which were running out as if they were attached to Urushi, created a speed that was far faster than they had imagined. As we looked back from Urushi’s back, I saw that they were all following closely.  At that moment, I discovered the antidemons running from the front.  As I thought, even Fran and Urushi could not completely block them. There were probably not many of them yet, but they were sure that the antidemons had entered.  But don’t worry.  </p>
<p>「Grrrr!  Woof!」</p>
<p>  Urushi’s magic shattered the antidemons.  But it wasn’t just Urushi. </p>
<p>「You look a little slower, aren’t you!?」</p>
<p>「You look weak!」</p>
<p>「Yeah!」</p>
<p>  Anna and the others struck them down with their spears and pans.  With just one blow, the antidemons were defeated. No matter how low-ranked antidemons are, this wouldn’t be possible under normal circumstances.  </p>
<p>「Y-You’re the power of Saintess-sama?」</p>
<p>「Thanks to everyone’s courage! I’m just helping you with that!」</p>
<p>「As expected of Saintess-sama! </p>
<p>「This way, you can fight!」</p>
<p> They were initially surprised, but soon changed to serious.  By gaining more power, they must have understood once again that they were on their way to the battlefield.  However, no one escaped. I wonder how reliable their comrades were. Their determination and thoughts were conveyed to me.  </p>
<p>「Urushi, something a little surprising might happen. </p>
<p>「Woof? Woof woof!」</p>
<p>「Ufufu, thank you」</p>
<p> I patted Urushi’s neck as he barked vigorously, and I said those words.  </p>
<p>「Lauda, lend me your strength again!」</p>
<p>  As I put my finger on the harp, a loud vibration echoed as if to respond to it.  Right now, I could use his power correctly.  It was different from then.  That’s why I’m fine. I took a deep breath, then shouted.  </p>
<p>「Sing a holy verse, oratorio! Divine Sword Release!」</p>
<p>  My </p>
<p>『Divine Sword Release!』</p>
<p>  gave off a strong light. Lauda transformed into a shimmering, glowing in her hand, as if she was made of brick or something.  </p>
<p>「W-woof!?」</p>
<p>「That’s right.  So, this is the true form of the magic string Lauda.  The Holy Sword, Oratorio. A Divine Sword」</p>
<p>  The first time I released this power was the day I killed my foster father.  With anger and curse, I used Lauda’s power. And that was the first and last moment I heard Oratrio’s sound.  anger and guilt.  fear and regret. My various negative emotions have corroded my mind and robbed me of my painful memories.  Since I was a child, I had the power to sense emotions of others. I didn’t expect anything strange, but it seemed to be a rare ability for a person.  My foster father said that he had good sympathy for others.  It was a wonderful ability that everyone could enjoy the sound.  But that was not all.  The day when he cursed his foster father using Lauda, a gift from his foster father. I caught the negative emotions of others and was crushed by their pure black feelings.  Then, I sealed away some of my memories and emotions from the Divine Sword.  No, I guess Oratrio had sealed me away to protect me. Now I can understand.  If my memories remained, I would have been broken by the fear of overly great power, my guilt, and regret. At that time, I too would have been the symbol of doom and despair.  But the tone of the oratorio must not only sound like despair. An instrument named after the Divine Sword could also play a song of hope that made many people happy.  I was convinced of that. He played a silver harp in my hand, which was almost as big as a hand.  Then, a number of instruments appeared around me.  A drum, an organ, a Filuria, a Castannet. And all the other instruments that I could play had also appeared.  They were lined up in a semicircular shape that surrounded me, as if they were all part of a single instrument.  All of them were oratorios.  All I wanted was for them to sound like this. With this, I would be able to play complex songs by myself. The ultimate instrument for magic song users.  That was the Saintess Sword, Oratorio.  </p>
<p>「Guys!  Everyone, lend me your strength!」</p>
<p>「T-How do I get my help?」</p>
<p> Anna-san was bewildered after seeing the oratorio, but she soon reacted to my words. Everyone was listening to my voice. I told them that.  </p>
<p>「I’m going to sing!」</p>
<p>「Eh?  No, now?」</p>
<p>  She looked puzzled. Of course, that was only natural.  But that was what would save Fran and Urushi.  </p>
<p>「Yes!  Don’t worry. </p>
<p>「U-Understood!  It’s what Saintess-sama says! I’ll believe it!」</p>
<p>「Thank you very much」</p>
<p> Everyone seemed to agree with her words. She straightens up her body to sing.  I’m playing a song that everyone in this city has sung before. It was a song similar to a lullaby.  </p>
<p>「The truth of the score...  The composition, </p>
<p>『An adventurer’s song』</p>
<p>  I drew a score to form the thoughts and power contained in this song. I wondered how long ago I had been so excited.  </p>
<p>「Well then, let’s go」</p>
<p> I exhaled lightly and I weaved hope into it.  </p>
<p>「I’ve come at risk of my life huh...?  It’s the dangerous golden continent huh... ♪ Getting a kid! A dream adventure huh?」</p>
<p>「T-This song...」</p>
<p>「You can sing it now, you know?」</p>
<p>「But how did you get this song?」</p>
<p>  It seemed that she immediately understood what song was after she heard my song. Perhaps it’s not a song to be sung on the battlefield. The melody was cheerful and the lyrics were quite bad.  But it was an adventure and bond song that had been sung for many years. This was the only song I could think of.  I turned around singing and stared at everyone with the thought of </p>
<p>「Come together!」</p>
<p>. I guess they understood that feeling.  And so, Announcer-san and the others started singing it together.  At first, it was a little. But gradually, the number of sounds added more and more emotion to the lyrics.  </p>
<p>「We are adventurers~... ♪ The golden adventurers~... ♪」</p>
<p>「No foe shall make us falter!」</p>
<p>「Dragons, demons, bring anything on!」</p>
<p>「The hordes of antidemons will be a piece of cake!」</p>
<p>「For booze, for friends, for gold!  The adventurers fight on!」</p>
<p>「Don’t lose... ♪ Let’s move forward― ♪ Show me your pride♪」</p>
<p>「Get up! Now, from here is the chance!」</p>
<p>「Show me your full strength!」</p>
<p>「We’re adventurers~... ♪」</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Golden adventurers~...♪」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p> I bunched up the thoughts of the people and added them to the sound of the oratory.  I could feel the song becoming a power and spreading it. Now I can deliver sound to the entire city.  I’m rare, Fran and Urushi’s safety.  Victory in the battle of antidemons. I added this song, created by Oratorio and the others.  </p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  I see it!  It’s Fran and Urushi! They were still fighting!  I was screaming. I wanted to show them that we’re here too.  </p>
<p>「Fran!</p>
<p>「Fran!</p>
<p>「Fran! I’ve brought reinforcements with me!」</p>
