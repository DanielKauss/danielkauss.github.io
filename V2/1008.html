</div><h1>Chapter 1008</h1><p>「Black Lightning God’s Claw!」</p>
<p> The black lightning on Fran’s body then converged on my blade and covered the whole blade. </p>
<p>『The control of this technique is complete!』</p>
<p> It was a flowing manipulation of black lightning. I guess this was also thanks to the blessings of the Beast Bug God. After all, the control of the techniques related to the Divine Attribute was surprisingly smooth. Moreover, I was using the Black Lightning God’s Claw while still maintaining my Sword God Transformation. It was a fusion of my trump card and my trump card. As I’d expected, she was really exhausted after coming this far. My durability value was starting to decrease rapidly. It was not a technique that could be used many times. It was not a technique that could be used many times. </p>
<p>「Really!?」</p>
<p>「Kuh...!」</p>
<p>  Fran swung me out in disbelief.  Meritte, who was lacking calm, easily caught sight of her movements.  He quickly held up his cross-shaped magic sword above his head and tried to take Fran’s attack. However, he quickly backed down his sword.  He didn’t want to take it with his sword. Seeing me clad in black lightning, she must have thought that the cross-shaped magic sword was dangerous. And yet, Fran’s front kick was stuck in Merritte’s open abdomen.  </p>
<p>「Ghaaah!」</p>
<p>  With a cracking sound in her hard chest, her body jumped backwards. Fran followed her and jumped, holding me above her head. Meritte, who couldn’t fully control her movements in a cone state, and Fran, who could freely move in the air with an aerial jump, will surely hit her next blow.  </p>
<p>『I can push myself now, but I don’t know if I can defeat the antidemon Meritte. But more importantly――』</p>
<p>(Sword!)</p>
<p> Meltritte seemed to find it dangerous, and I was confident in it. I know almost everything the hardness of the other side from our previous clashes. With the power of the Sword God Transformation and the Black Lightning God’s Claw, I can definitely cut through the cross-shaped magic sword. </p>
<p>(If we destroy it, it might interfere with Meritte’s plan.)</p>
<p>『That’s how it works.』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  Fran, who had aimed for it, exhaled lightly and exhaled. That showed that she was ready.  </p>
<p>「You’ve gone quite far!」</p>
<p>  Fran must have realized that her aim was not her, but the cross-shaped magic sword in her hand. Meritte exclaimed with a desperate look on her face. Her face looked like that of a normal human being, not a warrior, not a strong one, not an antidemon.  She was just a woman who only hated and lamented the world. I’m sure if she didn’t have any revenge, her life would have ended peacefully.  Fran looked sad for a moment. But she soon returned to her prepared face and swung down the blade of black lightning.  </p>
<p>「Raaaaaah!  Heavenly Judgment!」</p>
<p>  The Sword God Transformation, the Black Lightning God’s Claw, and Heavenly Judgment. This was the strongest blow that Fran could unleash right now.  </p>
<p>「Stop!」</p>
<p>  Meritte tries to protect her by holding the cross-shaped magic sword with her own body. In the first place, the cross-shaped magic sword was so big that a small Meritte’s body couldn’t hide it. The black blade held the cross-shaped magic sword――. Grrrr!  </p>
<p>「!」</p>
<p> With an explosion that was so intense that it was hard to believe the swords were hitting each other, the black lightning and golden magic power scattered violently.  </p>
<p>「Nrgh!」</p>
<p>「...!」</p>
<p>  It wasn’t the cross-shaped magic sword that I clashed. For a moment, I was convinced that my blade, which was swung at a godspeed, would cut through the cross-shaped magic sword, and platinum Falcion interrupted us.  It was a golden dragonkin who interrupted us. The man who had caught the attack in an impossible position was blown away by it with tremendous force. Seeing the man intervened between them, Fran and Meritte mentioned his name at the same time. </p>
<p>「Trismegistus...!」</p>
<p>「Trismegistus!」</p>
<p>  Both of them had bitter looks on their faces. Aside from Fran, who was in their way, why was he even staring at Trismegistus until Meritte was saved?  It seems that the black lightning delivered to Falcion caused them to burn, and the blade was deeply slashed from their shoulders by an attack that could not be completely canceled out.  They stood up, holding the wound with their burned hands.  However, the golden dragonkin seemed to be more curious about his beloved sword than he was. He nodded many times, stroking his blade with his red-blooded hands.  </p>
<p>「If I hadn’t covered his blade with magic power, it might have been in danger.  I see.」</p>
<p> Fran was caught by a lethal blow and backstepped away from Trismegistus to release the Sword God Transformation.  instincts must have understood that it would be more dangerous.  In fact, my durability loss was beginning to accelerate.  It seemed that she could now discern dangerous areas.  </p>
<p>(It got stopped...)</p>
<p>『Yeah.  It looks like Trismegistus’ enormous magical power was being channeled into the sword. That sword now could be as strong as a Divine Sword』</p>
<p>(Nn...)</p>
<p>  Fran exhaled and frustrated. After all, her all-out attack had been blocked by that level of damage.  Well, it couldn’t be helped. It would be amazing if she succeeded in hurting a monster that was using Divine Dragon Form quite a bit, and even more so, if she managed to blow it up.  But while Fran was breathing, Meritte was still taking a bite out of Trismegistus.</p>
<p>「That’s because my beloved sword, Juanaverta, told me that it’s better to do that」</p>
