</div><h1>Chapter 986</h1><p>Finally, Fran and Isario stopped and stared at the battlefield from the top of the low hill. Well, the only people who could see clearly were Fran and Isario, but a few others with teleportation skills. Fran and Isario were standing side by side, a little further away from the exhausted adventurers. </p>
<p>「Sh-she’s not out of control, huh?」</p>
<p>「Woof」</p>
<p> She turned around her long white hair and black skirt, and while thrusting her left hand into the ground, she jumped around in a forward stance. The white long hair and the long black skirt are reversed, and the Pine Snow was jumping around with its left hand thrust into the ground in a forward stance.  It looked like a beast. By grabbing the ground with his left hand, he was able to perform a sudden stop, which would be difficult for a normal human.  His arms seemed to be tremendous, and as if he had rushed at super high speed, his left arm was even able to jump around and turn at a right angle. It was a movement away from humans. However, it seemed that he still had a firm will in his eyes.  </p>
<p>「That sheath effect」</p>
<p>「Sheath?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. It has been the same in the past」</p>
<p> Isario, who had been fighting on this continent for a long time, had seen Berserk being released several times in the past.  </p>
<p>「It seems that General Hagane has strict restrictions on the use of Berserk.  They always follow those restrictions at all times」</p>
<p> It seemed that General Hagane had always brought about a thousand old soldiers with him, and that Berserk could only be opened when the damage reached a certain number. Just like the previous time, the number of old soldiers had been reduced by half, and soon after, Berserk was released. According to Isario’s point of view, that sheath was usually used to seal Berserk, and the white magic power emitted was a signal that it could be released. </p>
<p>「And I don’t think that sheath’s ability is just used to seal Berserk.」</p>
<p>「Is the fact that you aren’t out of control another effect?」</p>
<p>「Probably.」</p>
<p>  Even now, he was slashing off a single antidemon dragonkin while standing still to avoid being surrounded. In the midst of such a super-fast battle that could only be seen from a distance, I could only imagine that they were able to move so precisely because they still had reason.  When I looked closely, I saw that magic power was flowing from the scabbard to both Maste‍ and Berserk. It wasn’t just a sealant, I guess. No, was it in the same direction as from the point of view of suppressing Berserk’s power?  Isario’s guess tells me that Berserk’s wielder could maintain his reasoning as long as the sheath was emitting white magic power.  </p>
<p>「But it’s not always the case.  It can take up to two minutes at most」</p>
<p>「Two minutes...Short.  What if it’s too long?」</p>
<p>「Well, Berserk took them down and started rampaging.  There were some who pushed themselves too hard before and went out of control. Certainly, he had destroyed the troops of other countries.」</p>
<p> I wondered if there was a way to manipulate Berserk without going out of control, but it was not that easy.  </p>
<p>「... Is the ability of a young lady like Mastelier to be killed by itself? Maybe she didn’t need to escape this far.」</p>
<p>「What do you mean?」</p>
<p>「It seems that Berserk’s abilities are greatly affected by the user.  The first thing I saw was the ability to attack very large areas.  He had stoned tens of thousands of antidemons on the battlefield in no time at all. He and his friend got caught up in it」</p>
<p> The next Berserk user to see was said to have exploded the person he slashed, and the next user had used ice and snow-type abilities.  Depending on the user, he could develop a wide variety of abilities.The next Berserk wielder to see them exploded the person they cut, and the next wielder to see them used ice and snow-type abilities.  That was the power of Berserk.  Isario’s rush to tell them to escape was probably because his abilities were not known.  He had distanced himself from them, just in case he had the ability to kill indiscriminately over a wide area. Even if he still had reason thanks to his scabbard, he wouldn’t be able to control his abilities.  </p>
<p>「Those antidemons or dragonkin I don’t know.  It would be difficult even for me to defeat them with a single blow.  I don’t understand the reason, but I guess it’s an ability to destroy every single one of them. I’m concentrating on the potential of Berserk」</p>
<p>「I see」</p>
<p>  So it was a killing skill, huh?  It was not suited for a large group of people, but against a small number of people, it may be an ability that was close to invincible combined with Berserk’s physical abilities. In our current situation, they were very reliable.  </p>
<p>「I’ve defeated them again!」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>  The magic released by Berserk enveloped the antid the antidemon dragonkin, causing them to lose their power and collapse.  As expected, they could be defeated one by one.  </p>
<p>「I knew it, you must defeat them one by one.  That’s amazing. This is a power I don’t want to make enemies with.」</p>
<p>  I’m grateful for that sheath too.  </p>
<p>「What is that sheath?  It’s a part of Berserk?」</p>
<p>  I thought so too.  I’d rarely heard anything about it when I listened to Berserk. Would it be better if it was more famous?  </p>
<p>「I don’t know.  But I think it was created originally with Berserk」</p>
<p>「Is that so?」</p>
<p>「Ask, in all likelihood, the sheath is of a lower rank. It would be even stronger if it was made to pair with Berserk」</p>
<p> That’s for sure. Besides, I think it doesn’t fit the concept of the Divine Sword.  I think Berserk is like a bunch of people when they die, and doesn’t think about the wielder or their surroundings. I don’t think a sheath to keep the wielder’s rational mind doesn’t fit for him.  Perhaps it was made in later generations to control Berserk.Maybe they were created in later generations to control Berserk.  At any age, the method of safely using the divine sword Berserk must have been researched, and it was not surprising that magical tools existed to do so.  </p>
<p>「...... We took him down again.  Amazing.」</p>
<p>「Arf......」</p>
<p>「Yeah, one-on-one, I might be in trouble.」</p>
<p>  So far, six antidemon dragonkin had already fallen. The collapsed antidemon dragonkin were steadily moving and began to disappear without regeneration.  </p>
<p>「Ah!  We got out of here!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Tch!  We’re after them!」</p>
<p> The antidemon dragonkin turned his back to attack us, probably realizing that we couldn’t beat the dragonkin.  The reason they didn’t attack the approaching old soldiers was probably because they were aiming for Isario. He was clearly aiming for the divine sword.  The distance from the dragonkin widened in no time at all.  Was the reason why he was unable to move because he was not sure who to target?  Certainly, the power of the dragonkin was to kill each of them for sure. And at the same time, the four of them were――  </p>
<p>「Uooooooooooooaaahh!」</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p> The antidemon dragonkin heard the roar of the dragonkin, and his body shivered and stiffened.  The antidemons, who didn’t even need to be frightened, but also capable of eliminating individual egos. The antidemons inherited this trait by easily bombarding themselves with suicide bombs.  However, no matter how I looked at them, they looked terrified. Even if they were not supposed to be frightened by nature, they had a presence that terrified them, I wonder.</p>
<p>「You should die.」</p>
