</div><h1>Chapter 1064</h1><p>「Brilliant Lightning Rush...... Sword God Transformation.」</p>
<p> Fran’s whole body is enveloped in black lightning and Divine Power. A man of Valusa’s caliber would surely understand how strong Fran was now. However, Valusa’s face had an expression that seemed more fun than ever. </p>
<p>「You’ve reached the king!」</p>
<p>「Let’s go!」</p>
<p>「Come ‘ere!」</p>
<p> Fran, who had taken down the Sword God, jumped. As usual, she quietly closed the distance between her and Valusa, acting as if she didn’t feel any signs. As usual, she quietly closed the distance between her and Valusa, acting as if she didn’t feel any signs.  The flash that was fired was a blow with a godspeed that pushed sharpness into it.  However, Valusa was reacting. He managed to take that blow when he interrupted his magic sword into my slash. Not only me but even Fran was surprised.  It was the first time that she hadn’t decided on a killing blow during her Sword God Transformation, wasn’t it? I had never been able to defeat it completely, and I had been regenerated, but this was the first time I had taken it with a sword.  However, the Sword God was calm and brutal. He had fired a slash again that Valusa had caught with all his might.  Valusa already had no time to take it. I managed to react, but this time he had been slashed down with his entire sword.  My blade cleaves Valusa’s torso, and the red blood soaks his blade.  Fran, on the other hand, only grazed the tip of her broken blade and her cheek was slightly slashed.  Without regenerating the wounds of the divine attribute, Valusa’s tall body fell to the ground. Valusa looked up at Fran, staining her gray hair with his own blood.  </p>
<p>「I thank you.  In the end, I found out that my path was wrong」</p>
<p>「... Yeah.」</p>
<p>「That’s what surprised the Sword God. He never gave up, even when his talent had peaked......」</p>
<p>  For someone crazy about swords, the level of Sword Saintship must have been considered low. Apparently, his skill level hadn’t improved any further, and he had reached the limit. Still, he may be satisfied that he was able to compete with the Sword King as a result of his continued training.  </p>
<p>「... The Raydoss army is always single-use, such as the invasion army outside...The guardians are veritable spirits.  Its leader is a monster......」</p>
<p>「Oh......  You knew him, right?  Yes, at most, you should be careful......」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>「Hahaha......  That’s a good one to die from.」</p>
<p> Valusa said so and ended up dead with a satisfied look on his face.  Looking down at such a man, Fran’s face was somewhat somber. She nodded her head as if she had been staring at him for a few seconds.  </p>
<p>「I learned a lot」</p>
<p>『Yeah, you’re right』</p>
<p>「You can’t just rely on your skills」</p>
<p> It seemed that she had renewed her determination that she needed to train her sword more.  </p>
<p>「... Master, let’s go」</p>
<p>『Ou!』</p>
<p> She buried Valusa’s body with her shattered magic sword into the ground and Fran turned her back from the spot.  She rushed back to the plaza, but there was no one left behind anymore. It seems that Urushi had let her escape well.  She followed Urushi’s lead and was able to catch up with everyone at the main gate.  Many of them were armed, but this was the weapon that she had handed to Urushi beforehand, from the Raydoss soldiers. It seemed that they gave it to us.  </p>
<p>「Fran-san!」</p>
<p>「 Charlotte! Are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Yes, it’s fine now.  Is Fran-san okay?」</p>
<p>「Nn!  I’m fine」</p>
<p>  Charlotte rushed over to us with a worried look on her face. She seemed to have sensed Valusa’s strength up close and was worried about Fran.  She checked Fran’s safety and stroked her chest.  Naturally, there were Raidos soldiers at the town gate, but they ended up kicking Fran and Urushi away. The reason for the increase was probably because some soldiers had escaped from the harbor.  For the time being, they had escaped to the place where their friends were supposed to be. They screamed when they saw Fran.  They used magic to blow off the closed gate and escaped from Dars. However, some of them had stopped.  They must have run out of energy when they heard that they were going to move to a neighboring town on a walk. Even though Fran’s magic would heal their wounds, they still remained physically and mentally drained, and some complained about hunger and thirst. With Fran here, Raydoss’s soldiers could be defeated, and some even wanted to take a break and regain some of their strength.  To be more precise, some of them didn’t want to leave Dars.  I don’t know how much they had been plundered, but they had their houses and properties here. Escaping a town they were born into must mean they had the courage. Some of them argued that with Fran and Urushi, they might be able to capture Dars.  But that was a tall order. They didn’t want to rely on Fran’s fighting prowess, but they couldn’t stay in Darss and take care of them forever, and they had no obligation to do so.  Besides, Fran’s main goal was to rescue Charlotte from Dars. It’s not a good idea to say it, but the other residents follow.  </p>
<p>「You can do whatever you want, but I won’t stay here」</p>
<p>  Some residents were making a fuss about her words, but others immediately fell silent. Well, the vast majority of people probably knew that they had no choice but to escape.  Still, some of them complained in an pompous manner.  There were idiots everywhere who just didn’t have a sense of sociality, like “I’m not in the majority, and I’m so cool”.  The ones riding on those assholes were probably the wealthy. They wanted to somehow regain their properties.  However, Fran was not really interested in those people.  </p>
<p>「Let’s go」</p>
<p>「No, but...」</p>
<p>「Just leave it like that. I don’t really want to help them」</p>
<p>「I-is that so?」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>  Fran was dry, and everyone was surprised.  And it seemed that they, who were only along with Charlotte, understood from the bottom of their hearts that if they offended Fran, they would be abandoned.  After that, they decided to follow Fran quietly, except for a few idiots who insisted that they couldn’t listen to Fran’s words.However, Fran was not really interested in those people. </p>

Some of them wanted to stay in the town like a port town, but this time they were all persuaded by their relatives.</p>
