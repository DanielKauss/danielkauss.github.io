</div><h1>Chapter 1054</h1><p>『What is spirit magic...?』</p>
<p>《...》</p>
<p>I asked back, but Announcer-san had no answer. All I did earlier was do some work with the auto-announcer feature.</p>
<p>『Umm, Fran. What’s wrong?』</p>
<p>「Dunno.」</p>
<p>『I see...』</p>
<p>What should we do next? We should reveal ourselves to Marl and ask her what happened?</p>
<p>It was just right, Marl, but her appearance was completely human. What was strange was that she could still fly without using magic.</p>
<p>What happened to Marl? When I appraised her, I found out what had happened to her.</p>
<p>Her race had changed from a demonkin demon to a spirit. Apparently, as a result of me stabilized her magic power, she became a spirit. Is that possible?</p>
<p>In terms of ability, it had become quite weak. Its magic power was also very weak, and its fighting power was on par with that of a D-ranked adventurer. In a sense, it could be said that it had abandoned so much useless magic power that it went out of control.</p>
<p>「Mar?」</p>
<p>「Thank you, so...」</p>
<p>「Mar!」</p>
<p>「I’ll take care of the water dragon... I’ll take care of Wishkall...」</p>
<p>I could see through Marl’s figure rapidly and he was losing his substance. His presence then faded at once.</p>
<p>Then Marl reached for Fran. Fran watched over her without doing anything.</p>
<p>The moment Marl’s fingertip gently touched Fran’s chest――.</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>To my surprise, Marl’s body was sucked in and disappeared into Fran. Was it assimilated into Fran? I looked in the presence inside Fran, but I couldn’t find any trace of Marl’s origin. However, Marl’s evidence was definitely there.</p>
<p>《The individual named Fran’s spirit magic has been leveled up》</p>
<p>My Spirit Magic level increased from 1 to 2, huh? Does that mean it was a Spirit Blessing? Fran put her fists on her chest and closed her eyes.</p>
<p>「Mahl, he’s here.」</p>
<p>『Can you get it?』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>I couldn’t sense it at all. However, perhaps it was the effect of Spirit Magic, Fran seemed to be able to clearly feel the power of Marl inside herself.</p>
<p>『No problem, right?』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>『Are you sure you want to use spirit magic?』</p>
<p>「That’s impossible. Mar is asleep.」</p>
<p>He’s asleep, isn’t he? I tried to use more various skills to look inside Fran, but I still couldn’t see it. It was as if Marl’s existence was just an illusion. But it was not an illusion at all.</p>
<p>In Fran’s hand, she was holding an iron collar that had fallen as soon as Marl had lost his substance.</p>
<p>「...Raidos, Kingdom of Raidos」</p>
<p>Fran muttered in a dark voice. I don’t know if I saved her, or if I couldn’t. But it seemed that Fran’s anger towards the Kingdom of Raidos had definitely been ingrained into her mind.</p>
<p>They killed each other and exchanged a few words for a moment. Even though that was all it was, the two certainly understood each other. Perhaps they had something similar to each other in character.</p>
<p>As far as I’m concerned, I’d like to leave it like that for now, but that can’t be said.</p>
<p>『Fran, let’s free the water dragon』</p>
<p>「Yeah」</p>
<p>Fran raised her head at once and looked down at the water dragon below us again.</p>
<p>There stood a purpleish-blue-scaled water dragon, standing quietly above the surface of the sea. Just as Marl had said, it did not seem to go on a rampage.</p>
<p>Fran carefully descended in front of the water dragon. She had been prepared to avoid any attack, but...</p>
<p>「Kullur......」</p>
<p>The water dragon didn’t attack us at all.</p>
<p>She stared at Fran with eyes that seemed to even be intelligent.</p>
<p>His throat was trembling thinly. His voice sounded sad and as if he was crying.</p>
<p>「She’s crying?」</p>
<p>『I’m not in tears, but... Maybe you can tell what just happened to Marl’s body』</p>
<p>「Nn...」</p>
<p>Fran and the water dragon had been staring at each other for a short time, and their heads suddenly stretched out toward us.</p>
<p>I braced myself but Fran didn’t move at all. Sure, I don’t feel any hostility, but they were water dragons, right?</p>
<p>The mouth of a huge carnivore beast that I could swallow approached me, but I couldn’t help but be calm. As expected of Fran.</p>
<p>It seems the water dragon’s interest was not in Fran but in the collar in its hand. It was sniffing the collar while making a huge hole in its nose.</p>
<p>Fran had a hard time because of the moisture in her nose!</p>
<p>I observe the movements of the water dragons as they try to purify themselves. That’s when the water dragon skillfully opened its mouth just a little and sucked its collar.</p>
<p>「Woof...」</p>
<p>「...I’m sorry」</p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>The water dragon shook its head lightly in response to Fran’s apology. The dragonkin were already intelligent, and this water dragon had lived for over a thousand years. I guess it was brainless than Fran in the worst way possible...</p>
<p>Well, it seems we’ll still be able to fulfill our promise now.</p>
<p>『Fran, chain.』</p>
<p>「Nn. I’ll be free to do as I please」</p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>When Fran raised me upwards, the water dragon showed no sign of caution. It seemed that it understood her words.</p>
<p>「Yes!」</p>
<p>Fran was aiming for the metal torso attached to the water dragon’s torso. It would be difficult for the water dragon to remove it on its own, and the chain for connecting it to the ship was now extended.</p>
<p>The blow that Fran unleashed did not damage the body of the water dragon, yet it only sliced through its armor perfectly. I could tell that the water dragon was surprised.</p>
<p>Even if he can’t use his sword, I can understand how awesome it is.</p>
<p>The face of the water dragon approached us again. magic power was concentrated on its forehead, and it seemed to be glowing... But then, a soft light emitted from the water dragon’s forehead and covered Fran. There was no sign of aggression, but what was it?</p>
<p>As I watched in amazement, the light was sucked into Fran’s chest, very similar to when Marl was assimilated into Fran.</p>
<p>「......Water dragons, thanks.」</p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>For some reason, Fran thanked him, and the water dragon swung itself and dived into the sea. I could feel its presence slowly leaving.</p>
<p>『Fran, what happened?』</p>
<p>「The water dragon gave Marl power. I can feel Marl’s presence more than before」</p>
<p>Ehhh? I have no idea. Anyway, I was glad it wasn’t a bad thing.</p>
<p>Fran muttered sadly as she saw off the presence of the water dragon away.</p>
<p>「I’ve gone.」</p>
<p>『Yeah』</p>
<p>But it wasn’t the end of the match.</p>
<p>『The enemy ship is still alive. Urushi is disturbing them, but the battle isn’t over yet』</p>
<p>「......Nn!」</p>
<p>『I’ll take that shit out of you guys then.』</p>
<p>「Okay」</p>
<p>The surviving ship from the Raidos Kingdom would be able to relieve Fran’s stress.</p>
<p>「Let’s go!」</p>
<p>I looked out the window, noticing that a part of the outer wall had collapsed.</p>
<p>Since the main body of the water dragonkin was still intact, I thought a ward might be created to prevent that from happening...... But the thunderbolt magic didn’t get blocked, causing the hull of the direct hit to explode.</p>
<p>I don’t know what kind of system this was, but it seemed that the barrier was just like a water dragon. With the release of the water dragon, the barrier stopped working. For some reason, the damage transfer that had been silent in the middle of the battle didn’t even occur.</p>
<p>In this case, the ship was nothing but a big mess. It had a backlash, but because of the chaos and damage, it was only a sporadic mess.</p>
<p>「Master! Get bigger!」</p>
<p>『Yeah!』</p>
<p>「Teyaaaaaah!」</p>
<p>I transformed into a huge one, slashing through the battle ships and shredding them into pieces with lightning magic. Some soldiers managed to escape to the sea, but the dark wolves created by Urushi’s magic only attacked them and made the sea red with dirt.</p>
<p>In addition, Fran boarded the water dragonkin directly. She thought that this was the commander of the Kingdom of Raidos.</p>
<p>Sure enough, there was a man who looked important, dressed in a luxurious admiral uniform, unlike the others. He was staring at Fran as she landed on the deck, trembling with an orc-like huge body. There were also magicians and knights around him.</p>
<p>「W-Who are you!?」</p>
<p>「Adventurers.」</p>
<p>「Kuh! There’s no way that lowly people like adventurers are that strong! The adventurers, of course, should kneel down in front of us! Crawl!」</p>
<p>Ooh, it’s been a long time since I’ve been to the Adventurers Guild. They seem to be from the Raidos Kingdom. But I can’t say for sure what’s going on.</p>
<p>「What’s wrong with the alchemist! Where has the little girl gone after the sheer impudence of defeating any opponent!?」</p>
<p>I guess he didn’t see Marl’s disappearance. It was like he came out after that and saw Fran go berserk.</p>
<p>Unlike summoning admirals, knights seemed to have a bit more decent judgment.</p>
<p>「Kuh... What strength......」</p>
<p>「I-is that so?」</p>
<p>「I can’t defeat one hundred of them.」</p>
<p>「I-That’s enough...」</p>
<p>「I’m sure this girl was the reason for the anomaly that came earlier...」</p>
<p>Knights and magicians were sneaking around at such a story. It seems the knights were strong enough to sense Fran’s strength.</p>
<p>「...So we should have had a closer look at the information coming from the Prime Minister...」</p>
<p>「Instead of securing a bridgehead, we will surely be annihilated at this rate......」</p>
<p>The negotiations might be better against the knights and magicians than against the pig admirals, who didn’t know what was going on.</p>
