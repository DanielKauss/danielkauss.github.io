</div><h1>Chapter 941</h1><p>Nothing really happened on the way to Brutori. Even if a few antidemons appeared, the adventurers had no work to do, as the holy knights of Silard and the black foot soldiers of Hagane would clash with each other.</p>
<p>Moreover, the speed of their march was extraordinary. The holy knights and black foot soldiers were both quite skilled, having the strength and healing potions to keep them on their feet.</p>
<p>Adventurers are following behind these two great powers.</p>
<p>Isario was sent flying alone, and the adventurers were able to run faster than the holy knights thanks to Fran’s title of “March of the Valkyrie”.</p>
<p>Thanks to that, we arrived in Brutori in about half of the time we had planned. It probably took us less than four hours.</p>
<p>The holy knights were looking at us with astonishment.</p>
<p>Apparently, the people of the two great powers had estimated the speed of their adventurers’ march much slower. For the holy knights and black foot soldiers, it must have been a clumsy, unreliable, and low-ranking force.</p>
<p>They neglected adventurers because they had to match up with those they had no hope of fighting.</p>
<p>But we ended up in a stalemate when we opened the lid. Naturally, there were subtle changes in the way we looked at adventurers.</p>
<p>Well, that doesn’t mean they will be friendly. The changes were from “Tch! Those weaklings in my way!” to “Fu-fun. Well, it seems you can use it, okay? I’m sure it won’t get in my way!”</p>
<p>The group had entered the town of Brutori and unloaded supplies at the large plaza in front of the gate. They had also started sending scouting soldiers to counter the antidemons, and were steadily preparing for it.</p>
<p>And then, Fran and the other commanders were currently discussing with the guildmaster of Brutori.</p>
<p>「Y-yes, welcome to our guild!」</p>
<p>But the Guild Master of Brutori was in a very low posture. Or rather, he was on the verge of getting down on his knees?</p>
<p>In the first place, the Adventurers Guild of Brutori was apparently small in scale and treated as a branch of the Guild of Nocta. Therefore, the Guild Master was still young, and had little experience in dealing with high-ranking adventurers.</p>
<p>Certainly, the Adventurers Guild of Brutori was quite small for a town of this size. It was probably because many adventurers would rush to the neighboring Nocta.</p>
<p>There were not many adventurers, so no large guilds were needed. Also, the guild was not big, so the adventurers did not need to come to the guild anymore.</p>
<p>We started our meeting in the small conference room of the small guild, but it was completely at the pace of the two great powers. It was just a ritual for them to say their requests from above and for the guild master to accept them.</p>
<p>In other words, they would deal with the antidemons themselves if they showed up, while the adventurers would back down. That was all they wanted to say.</p>
<p>Since they used the divine swords, they had little idea of cooperating with people from other countries or organizations. After all, even the knights and soldiers accompanying them would be a hindrance when they used the divine swords.</p>
<p>As for the two great powers that have yet to regain their hostility, I wondered whether we should fight first or not, but that didn’t seem to be the case.</p>
<p>Apparently, there has been a pact between the two countries for a long time now, changing the country to prioritize deployments every time.</p>
<p>It seems that it is their turn to give priority to Silard this time. Without any serious argumentation, Silard was naturally decided to fight first. They would not talk to Fran and Isario.</p>
<p>As Fran tilted her head, the guildmaster quietly told us many things about the situation. He was probably afraid that Fran would say something unnecessary and buy the two countries a ruckus.</p>
<p>The guildmaster here apparently thought that Fran was sent to select a subtle person. He knew her abilities, so he wasn’t looking down on her. However, she was a child and the rumors were quite extreme. He didn’t seem to be worried that she might cause a conflict with the two great powers.</p>
<p>Fran twitched her head a little and looked at me an annoyed look.</p>
<p>As for Isario, she had been drinking ever since. Apparently, she didn’t work if she didn’t have to work. Still, the reason why she came to this city was to reassure the people of this town by seeing Isario, a famous person.</p>
<p>This old man was still a drinker, but he seemed to understand the subtleties of what’s going on.</p>
<p>In the end, Silard was the first one to attack, followed by Hagane if anything else comes up. If there was a next one, Isario would deploy, and the other adventurers were the gatekeepers.</p>
<p>Fran may want to deploy, but it would be dangerous to go against the two great powers, and we should watch over them here. Fran knows that, so she nodded reluctantly.</p>
<p>After the meeting, we somehow headed for the bar with Isario. Since the guildmaster was ready to give all the instructions to the adventurers, we decided to leave it to him.</p>
<p>He wanted to make a bit of a presence, and was also worried about leaving it to Fran. He said that he would split the adventurers into groups and let them watch over the gate in turns.</p>
<p>Fran only asked later for a breakdown of the rotation and followed that to the gatekeeper.</p>
<p>Isario put up a snack, Fran asked for a large amount of food, and we sat down in the corner of the bar. Perhaps because both of them were hiding their presence, no one was trying to pick a fight with them.</p>
<p>Both Fran and Isario continued to eat in silence. I didn’t think they would get along well, but I didn’t feel uncomfortable even if they kept quiet.</p>
<p>Maybe it was because they were both high-ranked adventurers? Or maybe it was because they were so different in age and personality that some of them collided with each other?</p>
<p>They were surprisingly compatible. When they had less food to eat to a certain extent, Isario finally opened his mouth.</p>
<p>「Young miss, I don’t trust you at all.」</p>
<p>「Master said you were the right person in the right place. If you want to, I’ll let you do it」</p>
<p>「Kuhahaha, that Master-san is fine. That’s right. You can do whatever you want to do at work」</p>
<p>「But I’ll leave when it comes to fighting.」</p>
<p>『Is that so?』</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>「Likes to fight.」</p>
<p>「We have to fight to be stronger.」</p>
<p>「You have those straight eyes, huh? Uncle, I’m jealous when I see those eyes」</p>
<p>Isario muttered something like that and gulped down the wine. His tone was as easy-going as ever, but I could hear his words in a serious tone.</p>
