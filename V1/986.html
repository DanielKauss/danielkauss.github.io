</div><h1>Chapter 986</h1><p>Finally, Fran and Urushi paused and stared at the battlefield from the top of a small hill.</p>
<p>Well, Fran and Isario were the only ones who could clearly see it, but only a few others with vision skills.</p>
<p>Fran and Isario stood in line, a short distance from the exhausted adventurers.</p>
<p>「Sh-she’s out of control, isn’t she?」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>He turned around with his white long hair and a black long skirt, and leaned forward while putting his left hand on the ground.</p>
<p>She took them like beasts. She must have grasped the ground with her left hand to allow for rapid braking, which would be difficult for a normal person to do.</p>
<p>Her strength must have been tremendous, as if she had rushed forward at super high speed, but her left arm alone was enough to jump up and turn at right angles.</p>
<p>However, her eyes seemed to still have a firm will of theirs.</p>
<p>「That’s the effect of that sheath」</p>
<p>「Sheath?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. I’ve been through this before」</p>
<p>Isario had been fighting on this continent for a long time, and had seen Berserk being liberated several times before.</p>
<p>「I heard that the Militant Nation of Hagane has strict restrictions on the use of Berserk. They are always obeying those restrictions.」</p>
<p>It seems that General Hagane has always brought about a thousand old soldiers, and Berserk can only be opened when the damage reaches a certain number.</p>
<p>Just like the last time we saw him, the number of old soldiers had been reduced by half, and Berserk was opened immediately after that.</p>
<p>According to Isario’s story, that sheath was usually used to seal Berserk, and the white magic power emitted was a signal that he could be released.</p>
<p>「Moreover, I don’t think the sheath’s ability is just to seal Berserk」</p>
<p>「Is that one other effect?」</p>
<p>「Probably」</p>
<p>Even now, he was still slashing away at one of them, standing still not to be surrounded by antidemon dragonkin. I could only imagine that he was able to move so precisely in such a super-high-speed battle that could only be seen from a distance.</p>
<p>When I looked closely, I saw that magic was flowing from the sheath to both Pine Snow and Berserk. It was probably not just a sealing tool.</p>
<p>No, maybe they’re in the same direction as us in terms of suppressing Berserk’s power?</p>
<p>Isario’s guess was that Berserk’s wielder could maintain his sanity while the sheath was emitting white magic power.</p>
<p>「But it’s not like we’ve been here all the time. It could be up to two minutes」</p>
<p>「Two minutes...... Short. What if it’s too long?」</p>
<p>「Well Berserk then swallowed them and went on a rampage. There was someone who pushed themselves too hard before and started to go out of control. I’m sure they had destroyed the troops of other countries」</p>
<p>I wondered if there was a way to manipulate Berserk without needing to go out of control, but it was not that easy.</p>
<p>「......So your ability as a young lady is something like a killer by itself? Maybe you didn’t need to run away until now.」</p>
<p>「What do you mean?」</p>
<p>「It seems that Berserk is a wielder that has a great influence over his abilities. The first thing I saw was the ability to attack extremely wide areas. He was able to petrify tens of thousands of antidemons on the battlefield in no time at all. All of them were involved.」</p>
<p>It seems that Berserk’s next wielder exploded the person he slashed, and the next wielder used ice and snow-type abilities.</p>
<p>It was Berserk’s ability to express a wide variety of abilities depending on who used it.</p>
<p>Isario hurriedly instructed her to run away, probably because she hadn’t known what kind of ability this tree was. She had distanced herself from it, just in case it had a wide range of indiscriminate killing abilities.</p>
<p>Even if he still maintained his rationality thanks to his scabbard, he wouldn’t be able to control his abilities well.</p>
<p>「Those guys I don’t know if they’re antidemons or dragonkin. It would be difficult for me to take them down with a single blow. I don’t understand the logic, but I guess it’s a skill that ensures that each one of them is buried. So, I’m concentrating Berserk’s potential on that」</p>
<p>「I see」</p>
<p>That’s why he’s a killer on his own, huh? He’s not good enough to deal with a horde, but against a small number of opponents, combined with Berserk’s physical ability, he may be close to invincible. I could say that he was very reliable in our current situation.</p>
<p>「I’ve beat them again!」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>When the magic released from Berserk enveloped the antidemon dragonkin, they lost their power and collapsed. Like I thought, each blow was enough to kill them.</p>
<p>「Like I thought, I’d always defeated it with one shot. That was amazing. It was a power I didn’t want to turn into an enemy of」</p>
<p>It was me too. I was grateful for that sheath.</p>
<p>「What is that scabbard? It’s part of Berserk?」</p>
<p>I thought so too. I’ve rarely heard that story when I listened to Berserk. Wouldn’t it be better if he was more famous?</p>
<p>「I don’t know. But I don’t think it was originally created with Berserk」</p>
<p>「Is that so?」</p>
<p>「The scabbard is always lower in rank. If it was made to pair with Berserk, the effect would be much stronger.」</p>
<p>That’s certainly true. Besides, I think it doesn’t match the concept of the Divine Sword.</p>
<p>Berserk was like everyone else when he died, so I feel like he doesn’t think about the wielder or his surroundings. I don’t think a scabbard used to keep the wielder’s rationality would be a good idea.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was created later to control Berserk. In all ages, the method of safely using the divine sword Berserk had been researched, and it was not surprising that there was a magic tool for that.</p>
<p>「......I beat them again. Amazing.」</p>
<p>「Arf......」</p>
<p>「Yeah, I might not be able to win in a one-on-one fight」</p>
<p>So far, there were already six antidemon dragonkin lying on the ground. The collapsed antidemon dragonkin were motionless and began to disappear without being regenerated.</p>
<p>「Oh! I got out of here!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Tsk! You’re after us!」</p>
<p>Perhaps realizing that we couldn’t beat the red-scaled dragonkin, the antidemon dragonkin showed his back to the red-scaled dragonkin and tried to come towards us.</p>
<p>The reason why he did not attack the approaching old soldiers was probably because he was aiming for Isario. He was clearly aiming for the Divine Sword.</p>
<p>He quickly closed the distance between himself and the tree. I wondered when he should start aiming for this because he didn’t move? Indeed, the power of the tree was to kill itself for sure. Four of them at the same time――.</p>
<p>「UWOOAAAAAAH!」</p>
<p>「「「!」」」</p>
<p>The antidemon dragonkin heard the roar of the red-scaled dragonkin. His body shivered and stiffened.</p>
<p>The antidemons shouldn’t have been afraid of it, or even less self-absorbing. The antidemon dragonkin inherited that trait from their easy self-destruction attacks.</p>
<p>But no matter how I looked at it, I could only be frightened. Could it be that even an existence that shouldn’t have been frightened by nature had a presence that terrified them?</p>
<p>Looking at the antidemons with cold eyes, who were trembling and unable to move, snowy magic slowly swung Berserk up.</p>
<p>Then he muttered a word of death sentences.</p>
<p>「Kill them.」</p>
