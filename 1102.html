</div><h1>Chapter 1102</h1><p>「I can see Alessa!」</p>
<p> Fran raised her voice happily when she saw the faint lights of the city far away from the darkness. It was probably because she finally came to Alessa, who could not come back yet. Actually, she had heard some disturbing rumors along the way and was a little worried about it. It was in a town cafeteria where she stopped to eat. </p>
<p>「Has the Raydoss army crossed the border?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, it seems so」</p>
<p>「Yeah, it seems so」</p>
<p>「There must be many strong adventurers on the northern border」</p>
<p>「I didn’t think they lost, but they were pushed back by the number of adventurers」</p>
<p>  We were told that we were the dominant force, but... But young misses should be careful if they’re heading north」</p>
<p>「Nn...」</p>
<p>  And there was another reason why Fran was so depressed. It was about the goblin dungeon we had fought with the demon.  If she ever got into that dungeon, Nadia would evolve in a straight line.  I’d love for her to hurry to release it. But it seemed that the war this time had delayed our investigation again. We didn’t get any information anywhere that a new dungeon had been released in Alessa.  But still, did Amanda and Jean break through the border even though they were supposed to be there? Could it be related to the big plot of the Southern Duke that they had obtained from Hydman?  </p>
<p>「Master, hurry!」</p>
<p>『O-ooh!  You’re right』</p>
<p>「Urushi!  Full speed!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  The food was not that good―― but Fran was flat and hurried to leave.  Eating fast was bad for her body, so it was not good for her. But I guess it’s useless now.  As a result of continuing to walk off the roads and through the plains and forests at once, we had reached Alessa that night.  However, the air was strangely noisy. Was it because it was during the war?  No, it was not. As we approached Alessa, I understood why. BOOOOOOOM!  In the darkness, the flowers of explosions of flames blooming.  They blooming.  They blooming.  Was it the soldiers of the Kingdom of Raidos who were blown away by the impact? No, it was not a normal person to see them illuminated in the darkness for a moment.  Some of them had rotten faces and spilled eyeballs.  Some had broken heads and could see the inside. Some had their flesh cut off and had exposed white bones. Yes, it was an army of necromancy that attacked Alessa. The gate had not been broken yet, and a counterattack seemed to be taking place from the top of the wall.  </p>
<p>『Hmm?』</p>
<p>「Did you see anyone now?」</p>
<p>『Fran, you feel it too?』</p>
<p>  For just a moment, I felt a gaze on her.  However, she soon disappeared. I think it wasn’t from Alessa though...  </p>
<p>「Master!」</p>
<p>『It’s over there now!  But don’t attack it all of a sudden, okay? I don’t even know if it’s just the army of undead or if Alessa’s forces are slashing through it.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p> We decided to go to Alessa for the time being.  We understood the importance of the commander in the battle in Gordicia. We need to ask for instructions instead of fighting on our own.  But how do we get in? If we suddenly get closer to the wall, we might be confused.  So, we decided to get closer while glowing ourselves with light magic. Urushi managed to get in the shadows, and Fran was the only one there.  The sight of a beautiful girl glistening in the dark night sky was unusual, but I didn’t think she would immediately become an enemy. Besides, there were many people in Alessa who remembered Fran.  They recognized her right away and greeted her.  </p>
<p>「Fran, aren’t you!? Did you come to reinforcements?」</p>
<p>「Elevent」</p>
<p>「This way!  Come down!」</p>
<p>  The first one to call out to us was the dwarven Elevent. He seemed to be in charge of the south wall.  He’s not weak, but I’m sure he’s a D-ranked adventurer, right?  Doesn’t he have a commander a little higher than him?  But there was also a reason for this.  It seemed that the intercepting troops, led by Amanda and Jean, were still fighting at the borderline. I’ve heard that the army of necromancy that had come to Alessa was only a small army that had passed through it.  And I never thought that thousands of such an army of necromancy would only be treated as a small army that had passed through the defense network... Just how fierce the battle is on the front lines?  Fran was calm when she heard that.  She had fought with more than 10,000 antidemons on the continent of Gordicia. There were probably thousands of undead, so it didn’t seem like there were many.  </p>
<p>「Who’s higher in the ranks than Elevent?」</p>
<p>「It’s because there’s an enemy going into the town. They’re chasing it.」</p>
<p>「!  That’s a lot of work!」</p>
<p>「Yeah, it looks pretty awesome.  The Rank C adventurer who was in charge of the wall is heading out for chase. So, I have no choice but to command them.」</p>
<p>「I see...」</p>
<p>「The lord’s mansion is their commander, and the guildmaster is there too.  Can you hurry up and show us your face?」</p>
<p>「What is this place?」</p>
<p>「What the hell, there’s a lot of undead, but they’re not that strong. I won’t be a problem for a while.」</p>
<p>「Thank you for coming. We can still fight just by having a high-ranking adventurer come to the rescue」</p>
<p>  In fact, the expressions on the adventurers’ faces around the event were also brighter than before.  They had deployed their main forces, so they were not sure if they would help us. Moreover, the opponent was unknown.  And then, there was the appearance of a high-ranking adventurer who made a name for themselves in Alessa.  Even though she was just a little girl, she was definitely capable. I guess it was quite uneasy now.  </p>
<p>「You want to use the techniques to defeat the undead?」</p>
<p>「Can you use the techniques to purify a large area?」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>「Hmmm.  No, wait just a moment.  There are also our fellow necromancers on top of the wall. Even the undead they are using will be defeated.」</p>
<p>  I see.</p>
<p>「Understood」</p>
