</div><h1>Chapter 994</h1><p>Trismegistus, clad in golden mana, climbed down the stairs.</p>
<p>His magic power then illuminated the surroundings.</p>
<p>「......!」</p>
<p>「Hmm. But there aren’t many of them today?」</p>
<p>Fewer? In this?</p>
<p>At the top of the stairs, we found a terrifyingly large underground room. Even we, with blindness, couldn’t see through it.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was less than 100 meters or 200 meters. It was hard to believe that such a large space existed in that hill, so the space might be distorted.</p>
<p>Since this place was related to the power of the Gods, it wouldn’t surprise me if it was a kilometer or two in size.</p>
<p>In such an underground world, there were countless antidemons that Fran would gasp for.</p>
<p>All of them were strong too. Only high level antidemons with a threat level of C or B were swarming around hundreds of them.</p>
<p>Perhaps they had noticed Trismegistus, which emitted delicious magic power, their hostility turned to us at once. That was enough to make Fran, Urushi, and even Frederick stiff. Their appetite and killing intent was so fearsome that even Frederick could not believe it.</p>
<p>However, Trismegistus, who was under the same hostility as me, was not moving. He just stared at the room with the same light steps as before, as if he were going for a walk.</p>
<p>I see, it was not a normal mind. I felt more discomfort for the unusual than a sense of being reliable.</p>
<p>This must be another part of Trismegistus’ monstrous nature.</p>
<p>「Young miss, never enter the room.」</p>
<p>「If we stay here, the antidemons won’t attack us.」</p>
<p>The stairs and the room were apparently blocked by some kind of barrier, so the antidemons couldn’t even get in.</p>
<p>In a sense, it was the best special seat in the world.</p>
<p>The antidemons found an intruder into the underground room and began to move. A large antidemon with arms, an antidemon with a horse-like lower body, and an antidemon with multiple faces. All of them were special individuals.</p>
<p>If we were to fight, we would at most be able to take on three of them. Even if we were to take seriously without thinking about exhaustion, we would not be able to take on 10 of them.</p>
<p>No matter how strong Trismegistus was, how are we going to deal with these antidemons? Are we going to break out of this by targeting a few of them?</p>
<p>However, Trismegistus’ abilities were far beyond my imagination.</p>
<p>「Divine Dragon Form」</p>
<p>Trismegistus muttered quietly as he stared at the antidemons rushing into him, and a tremendous flash of light shook Fran and the others involuntarily closing their eyes.</p>
<p>When Fran and Urushi opened their eyes, the change was already over.</p>
<p>Wings grew out of her back, covering her forehead, arms, legs, neck, and other parts of her body with golden scales. Her horns and claws were extended, and her pupils were as long as a dragon.</p>
<p>And more conspicuous was the even more radiant golden magic power. On the stairs, it used to only cover her body like a layer, but it was now gushing from her body like a raging flame.</p>
<p>『Divine Dragon Form! I knew it!』</p>
<p>「...She’s strong」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>『Yeah. To be honest, I never thought I’d do something like this...』</p>
<p>The golden dragonkin struck the sky with his wings and accelerated in an instant. Even Fran and I, who had been watching closely, were completely blinded.</p>
<p>I realized they were 100 meters away. That was the only way I could say it.</p>
<p>If we had been in a hostile situation, both Fran and Urushi would have been chopped off in the head.</p>
<p>In terms of magic power alone, it was one of the strongest forces in the history of this kind. It was no match for Weena Rhyn when she used Demigod transformation.</p>
<p>It was not as good as the super-enhanced Weena Rhyn that I had borrowed from Demigod + advance. However, Trismegistus seemed to still have some leeway. If there was any further strengthening from here, we would have to line up with the serious Weena Rhyn.</p>
<p>In other words, he was one of the strongest forces in the world.</p>
<p>「Dragon Flame Swirl」</p>
<p>When Trismegistus wielded his arms, flames swirled, turning several antidemons into ashes.</p>
<p>「Dragon Ice Chain!」</p>
<p>Now it’s ice. The white mist released from the entire body of the golden dragonkin enveloped a wide area, causing the antidemons to freeze and crumble.</p>
<p>Rather than magic, maybe it was a skill? I had the impression that dragonkin all had their strengths and specialties, but...</p>
<p>Trismegistus had mastered many different attributes. Not only fire and ice, but also wind and lightning attacks.</p>
<p>In the first place, we don’t know who they are since they are golden dragonkin. They are different from the divine attributes.</p>
<p>「How many dragonkin are Trismegistus? Money, lightning? Light?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. Golden-scaled dragonkin have a special attribute that only royalty can give birth to. They are inhabited by a higher-level dragon spirit.」</p>
<p>「Dragon ki?」</p>
<p>「It’s a higher level of magic power, known as the Royal Power or the All-powerful Attributes. It’s the proof of a King that has all attributes and is said to be compatible with the Gods. In other words, she’s a King Dragonkin or a Golden Dragonkin」</p>
<p>It seems the Golden Dragonmen were a special existence with multiple attributes. That’s why they could use so many different abilities.</p>
<p>In addition, his swordsmanship was also impressive. Trismegistus did not stop for a moment, moving at high speed, slashing down antidemons.</p>
<p>With the release of attribute attacks and swordsmanship without pause, high-ranking antidemons were buried as just small fry.</p>
<p>Fran stared at her movements with a serious expression on her face. Even a monster piercing her was trying to gain something.</p>
<p>That’s because I believe we’ll get caught up in it sooner or later. Even when we were peeking into the hell, Fran was still Fran.</p>
<p>「Amazing...」</p>
<p>『Yeah』</p>
