</div><h1>Chapter 1064</h1><p>「Brilliant Lightning Rush... Sword God Transformation」</p>
<p>Fran’s whole body was covered with black lightning and Divine Power. A man of Valusa’s caliber must have understood just how strong Fran was now.</p>
<p>However, Valusa’s face had an expression that looked more fun than ever.</p>
<p>「Amazing! You’ve reached the king, huh!?」</p>
<p>「Let’s go.」</p>
<p>「Bring it!」</p>
<p>Fran, who had lowered the Sword God, jumped.</p>
<p>She then quietly closed her distance from Valusa, her behavior being as silent as ever.</p>
<p>The single blow radiated was a divine-speed blow with extreme sharpness.</p>
<p>However, Valusa reacted. She managed to take one of his blows by interrupting his magic sword into my slash.</p>
<p>Not only me but even Fran was surprised.</p>
<p>This was the first time I hadn’t decided on the killing blow I unleashed during my Sword God Transformation. I couldn’t defeat it completely, and I had been regenerated, but this was the first time I had taken it with a sword.</p>
<p>But the God of Swords was calm and cruel.</p>
<p>She unleashed the slash that Valusa had caught with all her might again.</p>
<p>Valusa already didn’t have time to take it. He managed to react somehow, but this time his entire sword was gone.</p>
<p>My blade cleaves Valusa’s torso, and the red blood wetting her blade. Fran, on the other hand, only managed to slightly cut her cheeks with the tip of her blade broken.</p>
<p>Without regeneration, Valusa’s tall body fell to the ground. Valusa looked up at Fran, staining her gray hair with her own blood.</p>
<p>「Thank you, thank you. In the end, I realized that I was on the right track.」</p>
<p>「I think it’s time for her to get some real combat soon」</p>
<p>「I’ve been surprised by the Goddess of Swords. She never gave up, even when her talent had peaked......」</p>
<p>For someone crazy about swords, the level of Sword Saint Skill must have been low at 4. Apparently, she had reached the limit, so her skill level could not increase any further.</p>
<p>Still, he was probably satisfied with it because he had been able to compete with the Sword King as a result of his continued training.</p>
<p>「...The Raydoss army is always throwing away the invading troops outside...... The guardians are the true spirits, and the commander is a monster......」</p>
<p>「Red Knight?」</p>
<p>「Oh... So, you knew them, huh? That’s right. At best, be careful...」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Hahaha...... That’s a good death match, isn’t it?」</p>
<p>But after saying that, Valusa ended up dead with a satisfied look on her face.</p>
<p>Looking down on such a man, Fran’s face was somewhat somber. She looked at him for a few seconds, and then nodded her head.</p>
<p>「I learned a lot from it」</p>
<p>『Yeah, you’re right』</p>
<p>「You shouldn’t rely on your skills」</p>
<p>She seemed to have decided that she needed to train her sword more.</p>
<p>「...Master, come」</p>
<p>『Yeah.』</p>
<p>She buried Valusa’s body in the ground with her crushed magic sword and turned her back on the spot.</p>
<p>We rushed back to the plaza and found no one left there anymore. Urushi seemed to have let them escape smoothly.</p>
<p>They followed Urushi’s mana and caught up with everyone at the main gate. Many of them were armed, but this was the weapon I had handed to Urushi in advance. They must have handed it to us.</p>
<p>「Fran-san!」</p>
<p>「 Charlotte! Are you okay?」</p>
<p>『Fran-san, are you okay?』</p>
<p>「Nn! I’m fine」</p>
<p>Charlotte rushed over with a worried look on her face. She had sensed the strength of Valusa up close and was worried about Fran.</p>
<p>She checked Fran’s safety and stroked her chest.</p>
<p>Naturally, there were Raidos soldiers at the town gate, but they ended up being scattered by Fran and Urushi. The reason for the increase was probably because there were soldiers who had escaped from the harbor.</p>
<p>He must have been fleeing to a place where his friends were supposed to be. He screamed when he saw Fran in person.</p>
<p>I blasted the closed gate with magic to escape from Dards. However, some of them stopped.</p>
<p>I guess she had run out of energy after being told that she was going to move to a neighboring town on foot. Even though her wounds were healed by Fran’s magic, physical and mental fatigue still remained, and some of them complained of hunger and thirst.</p>
<p>With Fran here, Raidos’ soldiers would be able to fight back, and some of them would want to take a short break and regain their strength.</p>
<p>To put it more bluntly, some of them don’t want to leave Dards. I don’t know how much of them had been plundered, but they had their houses and properties here. It must be courageous for them to escape their newborn town.</p>
<p>Some of them suggested that with Fran and Urushi, they might be able to take back Dars as it was.</p>
<p>But that was a tall order. I’m not that good at counting on Fran’s fighting prowess, but I can’t and won’t stay in Dahz for long to take care of them.</p>
<p>Besides, Fran’s main goal was to rescue Charlotte from Dards. That was not what she wanted to say, but the other residents followed.</p>
<p>「Defeating antidemons is just my job. But I won’t stay here.」</p>
<p>Some residents were noisy at her words, but soon they were silenced by others. Well, the vast majority of people probably knew that they had no choice but to escape.</p>
<p>Even so, there were still people who complained about their superiority. Everywhere, there were idiots who just didn’t have a sense of sociality, like “I’m so cool that I can’t get into the majority of the army”. The wealthy were probably the ones who were riding on those assholes. They wanted to somehow regain their wealth.</p>
<p>But Fran was not really interested in those people.</p>
<p>「Let’s go.」</p>
<p>「No, but......」</p>
<p>「Just leave it to me. It’s not like I really want to help you」</p>
<p>「I-is that so?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Everyone was surprised when Fran was dry. And they too, after all, they truly understood that if they offended Fran, they would be abandoned.</p>
<p>After that, all but a few idiots who insisted that they couldn’t listen to Fran decided to follow Fran quietly, and the escape went smoothly. Some of them wanted to stay in town like a port town, but this time they were all persuaded by their relatives.</p>
