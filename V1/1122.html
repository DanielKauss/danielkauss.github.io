</div><h1>Chapter 1122</h1><p>The sanctions against the stepfathers, who had directed their weapons and killing intent at Fran, were brief. They were all sank in a blink of an eye and then beaten to a pulp until they cried by Fran. Those who did not lose their rebellious spirit at just a little beating were re-trained after they had recovered.</p>
<p>The way they almost killed ten men without any counterattacks must have completely taken them away from the valiant soldiers. This time, they showed how well they were connected by their limbs.</p>
<p>Some of them tried to escape at this opportunity, but that had been stopped by Urushi.</p>
<p>The blood drained even more from the faces of the comrades-in-law when she heard the men who had been sucked and lifted screaming so loudly.</p>
<p>There was no blood coming from the man, but his teeth seemed to have been pressing on his back a little harder. He was in a big state to give it an intimidating aura, but it seemed that he had misjudged the strength of his muscles.</p>
<p>Both Fran and Urushi just failed to adjust their strength a little, but the stepfathers must have seen them as merciless. Moreover, they couldn’t help but be afraid that their mercilessness might be directed at them.</p>
<p>He is very calm and obedient.</p>
<p>However, there was a slight change in Fran.</p>
<p>(Master)</p>
<p>『What’s wrong?』</p>
<p>(If we just keep running, it might get the same again.)</p>
<p>『Aah, well, maybe that’s true』</p>
<p>(I’ll tell you why they let you run.)</p>
<p>『Oooh! That’s a good one!』</p>
<p>Seeing the dissatisfaction of the stepfathers, he thought that we couldn’t just let them run. He decided to tell them what it meant to let the stepfathers run.</p>
<p>You’ve grown a lot to the point that you wanted to tell people about your thoughts!</p>
<p>While I was impressed, Fran overtook the men and went to the front of the line. The chase from behind was changed to Urushi.</p>
<p>「You guys don’t listen to, smell, smell, bother, steal, and think badly」</p>
<p>Did they say it twice? Well, Fran had a good nose, so I guess it was important. The bravery soldiers had indescribable expressions on their faces as Fran suddenly began to butcher them.</p>
<p>「It would be useless if we take you to the battlefield. On the contrary, it would be useless if we interfere. If things continue like this, you’ll be on par with goblins. No, goblins can get magic stones, but we can’t get magic stones from you. If it’s not, we won’t be able to get anything less than goblins」</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>That’s quite a horrible thing to say, isn’t it? But the warriors couldn’t go against Fran, so they just kept running.</p>
<p>「If I can at least run properly with this training, I’m sure I’ll be able to match up with goblins below. So, keep doing your best」</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>It was not so much that they didn’t object, but rather that they didn’t know how to react. For now, I guess they realized that their evaluation of themselves was low.</p>
<p>After that, I was cornered by Fran to the point that I felt a little sorry for her. In addition to running, Fran shouted curses at me like 「Those below goblins! I’ll do my best! If I didn’t do my best, I’ll stay below goblins!」</p>
<p>From Fran’s point of view, she was trying to incite the stepfathers, but I’d say they were rather broken. Well, I wonder if they were making progress in their initial goal of training the problem children.</p>
<p>In the end, they continued to run in silence for half a day, and the warriors eventually fell to the ground because of exhaustion.</p>
<p>Because of her mental exhaustion, no one dared to move. In contrast to these brave warriors, Fran was so kind that I couldn’t imagine she would start acting in the middle of the day.</p>
<p>「To those below goblins, you can eat this as a reward for your hard work. Well done, to those below goblins, you can even line up!」</p>
<p>What Fran gave to the surprisingly obedient warriors was curry. She handed it to each one of them.</p>
<p>I guess in Fran’s own way, she was working hard for the brave soldiers. It was a little self-made, but some of the men were in tears because of Fran’s kindness. They were in shock. Well, with this, they would accept the training quietly tomorrow.</p>
<p>But we also had to tighten our guards.</p>
<p>「If I’m gonna run away at night, Urushi will chase me as far as I can」</p>
<p>「Grr!」</p>
<p>「If Urushi doesn’t want me to eat it, I’ll go to bed peacefully」</p>
<p>「「「「Yes! I understand, captain!」」」」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>He wouldn’t be running away with this, but instead, he was exempted from all late-night watchouts. Fran and Urushi have decided to take turns.</p>
<p>Mordred and the others approached us as the stepfathers began to sleep to death, even though they had devoured the curry.</p>
<p>「Yeah. They were eating something delicious」</p>
<p>「Nn. Curry, the best food」</p>
<p>「It looks delicious」</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>Persona bowed her head deeply in time with Mareficent’s words. Seeing such a girl, Fran pulled out the curry again.</p>
<p>「You want to try it?」</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>Persona stopped in her tracks to take the curry. Then, she looked up at Mareficent. Although she couldn’t see her face due to the mask, she was clearly showing her pleading expression.</p>
<p>「It’s fine. But don’t mess with your clothes」</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>Persona nodded her head and ran forward with the curry above her head. Don’t moss!</p>
<p>「Thank you, sir.」</p>
<p>「I feel sorry for them if they are no longer friends.」</p>
<p>「Is that so?」</p>
<p>I guess the two are not going to remove the mask after all. All they want is more info on their mouths.</p>
<p>They lined up nicely and began to eat.</p>
<p>「This is delicious! Great!」</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>Persona didn’t say anything, but the speed of that spoon showed that she was sure she liked it.</p>
<p>After the meal was over, Mareficent and the others approached us again. They didn’t seem to have just returned the curry dish. They somehow had a map.</p>
<p>「I’d like to ask you something about the route we should take next.」</p>
