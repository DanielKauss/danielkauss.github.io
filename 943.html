</div><h1>Chapter 943</h1><p>After releasing the power of Alpha, the Blade of Origin, Adoru rushed into the antidemon army alone, one against one hundred thousand. But we didn’t feel uneasy watching them. The holy knights didn’t seem to be heading to support them, and they were really fighting alone. Maybe the holy knights were just like blatant blunders on the way here. Also, maybe they were going to wipe out the killing intent? Besides, if they were near that Adoru, they would be completely involved. It would be difficult for them to cover for them. It would be difficult for them to cover for them. Each time that Addle, clad in white magic, wielded its divine sword, a tsunami-like shockwave was released to engulf the antidemons.  Not only was it powerful, but it was really wide. Fran could fire a flying slash, but it’s impossible to cover it up so wide.  There was no expression on Addle’s face as she wiped out the antidemons. I could feel a strangely refreshing look on his face after the Divine Sword Release, but I don’t feel anything when he suddenly loses his expression. Addle didn’t seem to want to let out one of the antidemons at once, and she was carefully crushing them from the lower class antidemons without aiming for the commander at them at all.  There would be no disturbance.  The wielder of the divine sword wielded its power steadily, annihilating its enemies from the inside out. Such a scene only lasted until the very end.  </p>
<p>「It’s over.」</p>
<p>『Yeah...  It really was the same until the very end.』</p>
<p>  The commander who was cut in half just a few seconds ago and defeated was not weak. I’m sure Fran, who didn’t have Divine Beast Form, would have had a hard time. I wouldn’t say that she would lose, but it would take her a lot of time even if she gave her best.  It was as if she was a low-ranked antidemon.  After all, the power of the Divine Sword was outrageous. And it seemed that Ader was raised to unleash its full power. With that in mind, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that she was the strongest person in the world when the divine sword was released.  </p>
<p>(I’d like to see how they fight a stronger one.)</p>
<p>『Yeah, I’m also interested to see what happens if they’re a Unique in their class in Sendia.』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p>  Addle put her Divine Sword in her sheath. The white magic scattered around him then dissipated, and silence came to the plains.  Aside from Adoru, the holy knights didn’t cheer.  They probably thought it would be a shame if they caused a commotion. Also, if they knew the power of Adoru and Alpha, they might think it was only natural for someone like him.  </p>
<p>『I understand the horror of Alpha.』</p>
<p>(Adoru is strong too.)</p>
<p>『Yeah.』</p>
<p>  That’s a great country. Rather than letting the strong use their divine swords, it was training the strongest when they use their divine swords...  Berserk would be curious to see how strong they are as a pair with Alpha.  As I was thinking about this on the wall, I noticed someone approaching us. She doesn’t seem to be an adventurer that acted as a defense.  She is a beautiful girl with reddish-purple hair and twin-tailed hair that looked a little older than Fran. Moreover, she didn’t look like an adventurer.  It was a gothic dress based on black.  Not a dress armor, but a mini-scathed dress. They may be using monster materials, but I don’t think they have any defenses.  If they were this conspicuous, they would remember it when they saw each other.  Her face was expressionless, but I didn’t feel any hostility.  Who was she? It was obvious that Fran had some business here.  </p>
<p>「... Who are you?」</p>
<p> She was right. There’s no way many people would be able to ride on that carriage, and if there was anyone other than you, the commander, it was most likely that you were the wielder of the Divine Sword. The worst kind of Divine Sword, Berserk, would definitely go out of control if you use it and eventually lose your life.  The wielder is, to make matters worse, a sacrifice. Is this girl their sacrifice?  The hydrangea shook her head in response to Fran’s question. It was very similar to Fran in that it was expressionless and hard to read her emotions.  </p>
<p>「How is it?  That’s true and I can say that it’s not」</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>「Are you an adventurer?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Fran, a B-ranked adventurer」</p>
<p>「Yes.  You――」</p>
<p>「Hydrangea.  So, you’re here. I’m sure it’s time for us to move」</p>
<p>「Mtsuyuki」</p>
<p>  It was a girl with a face very similar to her who called out to the hydrangea.  I guess she was a little older than her. The hydrangea was fifteen years old, and the Songyu was 18 years old.  Her long hair, which was white as snow, was roughly divided into left and right.  It seemed to be divided into three blocks. The kimono she was wearing was a black dress with a long skirt, a little older than the hydrangea. Well, in the end, it was a gothic loli dress with frills on it.  This girl smiled unlike the hydrangea.  But I wonder why the hydrangea was more familiar than the hydrangea. </p>
<p>「The Hydrangea Onee-chan?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, but I can also say that it’s not」</p>
<p>「Another one」</p>
<p>「It’s true, so it can’t be helped」</p>
<p>  The hydrangea shrugged her shoulders lightly and turned her body.  I wonder what her purpose was? She said that she wanted to talk to Fran who looked similar to her.  </p>
<p>「Hey again」</p>
<p>「Yeah」</p>
<p>  The hydrangea nodded at Fran’s words.  Their expressions were very similar. </p>
<p>『In the end, I couldn’t tell if they were the wielders of the Divine Sword or not』</p>
<p>  Its fighting prowess was probably not that great, I think Diggins was the only one.  But I’ve only seen him after all. It didn’t matter if they were their fighting prowess or not, whether they were the wielders of the divine sword or not.  But I hope they are as different as possible.  I can’t believe such a girl would be a sacrifice for the divine sword... But Fran muttered to herself.  </p>
<p>「I’m sure she’s the wielder of the divine sword.」</p>
<p>『Why did you think so?』</p>
<p>「Kinda...」</p>
<p>Her fighting prowess was about average, I’d say Diggins. But I think it was after seeing the adorable. It didn’t matter if she had the fighting prowess or not, she was the wielder of the divine sword. However, I hoped she would be different if possible. I couldn’t believe that such a girl would be a sacrifice for the divine sword... But Fran muttered to herself. </p>
<p>「I’m sure she’s the wielder of the divine sword」</p>
<p>『Why did you think so?』</p>
<p>「Kinda...」</p>
<p> A faint hint of sorrow appeared in Fran’s eyes as she saw the hydrangea off.</p>
