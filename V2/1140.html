</div><h1>Chapter 1140</h1><p>From the blood magic circle created by Mareficent, a human-shaped demon appeared covered in jet-black all over its body. Its arms and legs were so thin that it looked like they were too thin, but the eyes of the black-eyed men, whose white and black eyes were reversed from that of a human, were strangely powerful. A fierce smile seemed to be belligerent on its plump eggs-shaped face. But strangely, I didn’t sense any martial arts capabilities. Even from its standing position, the level of its martial arts skills did not seem to be that high. Was it a pure magician? If he was asking if he was a pure magician, or if he was capable of single-handedly supporting the battlefield.  I wondered if he was equivalent to a B-ranked adventurer? I thought so, but the true nature of this demon was not its fighting ability.  </p>
<p>「Woooof!」</p>
<p>  The demon thrust its hands forward and roared, stopping several of Durahan’s movements. Immediately afterward, the headless knights in red armor collapsed on the spot like a torn doll.  </p>
<p>「It has not much fighting power, but it’s specialized in fighting against necromancy. If you work with Forrund-dono, you will be able to hold back 1000 or 2000 undead.」</p>
<p>  Even so, there were some concerns about their pure fighting power, but I can only trust them now. Flame magic was still flying from the fort, causing damage. I thought it might be better to get away from here for a moment, but there was no doubt that if we slew the top brass here, the Raidos Kingdom would be in pain.  Besides, many adventurers were suffering from this.  It was not only Fran but also me who wanted to mourn for them. Well, Fran was much more motivated though.  </p>
<p>(Master!  Let’s go!)</p>
<p>『Yeah, you’re right』</p>
<p>「Maleficent. Where do you want to find that person?」</p>
<p>「Of course, I can take them with me」</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>  Persona was also confused in a state where she was held like a baby by Mareficent. I’m worried that she might be okay in such a state, but if we judge that there is no problem with Mareficent, we should be fine.  </p>
<p>「Okay.  Let’s ride Urushi’s back!」</p>
<p>「Oooh! Thank you very much!」</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>  Persona, who was put on her back first, was clinging to Urushi’s back and was smothering her fur.  Her mouth loosened and she was clearly looking forward to it. This guy looked pretty energetic.  </p>
<p>「Please wait, priestess!  Please bring me with you!」</p>
<p>「... Okay.  I’ll be standing behind Mareficent」</p>
<p>「Haa!」</p>
<p>「Eh? Don’t poison me, okay?」</p>
<p>「Sure. Well, it won’t even matter what smells, so just give up on that」</p>
<p>  Avenger seemed like a big deal to have besides Fran.  Besides, he’s a ghoul, so there were some things that made me a little nervous.  However, it was also true that we could only ride there if we took him with us. So, we need to have Mareficent hold back here.  </p>
<p>「Uuh. Persona, please purify your entire body later」</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>「Forrund, Donad, please take care of this」</p>
<p>「Aah」</p>
<p>「I’ll take care of that one for you!  But don’t push yourself too hard, okay? Surviving is the most important job of any adventurer!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  Urushi didn’t hide himself and just continued to rush towards the fort.  Fran and Urushi were too conspicuous to notice anymore. They would just be wary of us if we disappeared here. So, I thought I’d go head-on. Sure enough, the fire magic’s spearhead was pointed at us.  This should reduce the burden on Forrund and the others considerably.  </p>
<p>『Urushi, go!』</p>
<p>「Woof!  Woof!」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>「Good luck, Urushi!」</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>  With the support of the girls, Urushi accelerated even further.  He then dodged his flame magic brilliantly as he flew through the air.  The barrage of flame magic getting more and more violent.  Was he starting to get even more pissed off? But with Urushi’s evasive ability and the barrier between me and Mareficent, we were fine. Amid the countless explosions that adorned the air, Urushi made his way forward nimbly. </p>
<p>(Master, can you do something like this?)</p>
<p>『The barrier is...  It’s long gone』</p>
<p>  He unleashes an attack at the fort, but it doesn’t seem to be protected by any barriers. It seemed that the fort’s defense mechanism was not functioning as expected.  </p>
<p>『If that’s the case, we’ll just plunge into the rooftop where the Zhu Flame Knights are!』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  As Urushi descended onto the rooftop, dodging his more violent attack, the young man was staring at us with grins. After a closer look, I saw that he was really similar to Ionez, the vice-commander.  Appraisals work well with him.  The main mission of the Red Knights was to fight against magic beasts, and they are not expected to fight outside. Therefore, they were probably not prepared for appraisal.  Simply put, they were strong.  They had over a thousand magic power, nine levels of flame magic, and several skills useful for magicians such as split thinking without chanting. And yet, their swordsmanship was also high at level seven. In terms of physical abilities, he was on par with a Rank A adventurer.  However, the most conspicuous thing about this man was his equipment.  The mysterious metal tool in his hand radiated vicious magic power.  It was a cylinder about two meters long with a handle, an iron shot, and a trigger.  It was as if it was a gun.  No, it was more of a gun, or rather, a near-future product. It looked like the laser gun that a bipedal walker used to blow up a beam.  The name of the gun was also a work of art from a very fantasy world.The name “Flame-Style Controlled Armed Sword Inflation Im” was displayed in my appraisal.  It had the following abilities: Cannonshroud, Flame Control, Flame Amplification, Flame Absorption, Effect-sharing, and■■■■■■■ itself was a powerful cannon, so it seemed like it could share flame control with his subordinates.  Moreover,■■■■■What’s disturbing is that part.Flame Control, Flame Control, Flame Amplification, Flame Absorption, Effect-Sharing,■■■■■ and more.  These are powerful cannons that can be used to share flame control with subordinates.  Moreover,■■■■■What’s more disturbing is that the Divine Sword Release was hidden when I saw Sophie’s stats.  Don’t tell me this wasn’t a Divine Sword, right?  Maybe this was some kind of treasure huh.</p>
<p>「I’m not dead!」</p>
