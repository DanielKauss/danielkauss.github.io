</div><h1>Chapter 1079</h1><p>The Adventurers Guild’s interrogation of Dirk has not begun yet. Satia’s help would be needed to draw information from Dirk, but bringing her to the interrogation was her last resort. I don’t know what will happen to her now, but I’m sure she won’t be able to rely on the royalty of another country for the time being. If she was the Master of the Adventurers Guild, she would be able to do the request, but being a substitute for the lord seems to be a bad idea this time.Regardless of how he will be treated from now on, he certainly cannot rely on the royalty of other countries for the time being.  If he was the Master of the Adventurer’s Guild, he might have been able to make a request to us, but it seems that being a substitute for a feudal lord is not a good idea this time.  As a nobleman, he naturally wants to be as cautious as possible so that he is not at a disadvantage against his diplomatic partners.  However, Dirk would not open his mouth with some pain. Even though he was an enemy, his perseverance was worthy of admiration.  Fran threw Dirk at the floor and pointed me at him.  There was a puzzled look on her face.  She had no idea how to get Dirk to open his mouth. Maybe she really needed Satia’s help?  </p>
<p>「Are they gonna use some kind of magic potion to make her open her mouth?」</p>
<p>「A magic potion to make her confess, huh?  It’s not in our town.  They’re treated as dangerous drugs, so they’ll be given to you if you apply to the government and pass the screening」</p>
<p> Then, wouldn’t it be faster to escort him to the Royal Capital?  In the midst of it, Urushi approached Dirk slowly.  He stood in front of her and immediately opened his mouth to threaten her.  No, he was not intimidating her.  </p>
<p>「Arf!」</p>
<p>「Guh!」</p>
<p>  Urushi let out a gray smoke from his mouth. Dirk quickly closed his mouth and eyes and turned away.  </p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>「Gah...  Gwoh!」</p>
<p>  However, when he was pushed forward with Urushi’s paw, he was unable to help but cough. He had inhaled a large amount of smoke.  </p>
<p>「Arf!」</p>
<p>「...... Kuh!」</p>
<p>  As if he was floating in a high fever, Dirk’s cheeks turned red and his mouth slowly opened halfway. In addition, Urushi was exposed to a gray smoke over and over again. </p>
<p>『Is this the method of draining judgment with the multiple poisons Satia had been using?』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  It seemed that she had understood Satia’s methods and was able to do it herself with just one look. It was an amazing learning ability. </p>
<p>『Nice job, Urushi!』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>『Fran, let’s ask Dirk a lot of questions.』</p>
<p>「Nn.  Are you friends that appeared in Barbra?」</p>
<p>「That’s right...」</p>
<p> Yosh, Urushi’s poison was working well for him. He answered Fran’s question. The information obtained was the same as before, but I’m sure he had supported the report.  The most he took a bite from the guildmaster was the story of a spy from the Raidos Kingdom. If a Philias person was trying to trick a wolf into working in the Kranzel village, how would he spread that story to the Kranzel side? </p>
<p>「But adventurers connected to the Kingdom of Raidos come to this town as witnesses?」</p>
<p>  It seems that some of the adventurers in Dars were spies sent from the Kingdom of Raidos. He was originally a guard adventurer of the Morley Merchant Association, which the Raidos Kingdom used as a front for their activities.  Fran had forgotten about him, but I remember. Khanna, who we met on the way to the Kingdom of Belios, was supposed to be the daughter of the Morley Merchant Association.  At that time, Fran only recognized him as a country that was a little annoying to Raidos. So, I’m sure we wouldn’t miss out now.  </p>
<p>「For now, let’s look for someone from the Morley Merchant Association.  And I’ll restrain the adventurers who come to report on Metelmum」</p>
<p>  We tried to continue the interrogation, but Dirk stopped saying anything.  It seemed that he was too worn out and unconscious. From the fact that even recovery magic could not heal him, he must be mentally drained. Even so, it seemed that as his strength had recovered, he was able to open his mouth to some extent, and he slowly began to talk again.  There were also a lot of information that I couldn’t get him to spit out along the way. Among them, there was the worst information we could find.  </p>
<p>「The second group is heading for the south-eastern part of Kranzel, including Barbra」</p>
<p> It seemed that the Raidos Kingdom had originally planned to take on Barbra in a two-stage stance.  It would be fine as long as the first group, including the water dragonkin, could attack it.  If it was not enough, the second group that was waiting for Seedran would attack it. That was their plan. The Kranzel Kingdom and the Raidos Kingdom, which have underestimated adventurers at the scene, seemed to be very wary of them at the top. Moreover, it seemed that the second group was not limited to invasion from the sea. The Shallus Kingdom, which was located in the southern part of Barbra, had already been captured by the Raidos Kingdom, and from there, a large army was supposed to invade the Kranzel Kingdom.  The force that defeated the water dragonkin in the first group would not be able to do so well against the two ships. </p>
<p>『I heard about it in Ulmutt.  It must have been a small country that had been making a lot of noise after all』</p>
<p>(Ooh, I see)</p>
<p>『You don’t remember, right?』</p>
<p>  Fran seemed to have forgotten about it, but she had been causing a ruckus with adventurers through repeated recruitment. Perhaps she had been a puppet of Raidos since that time.  When she heard the danger of Barbra, there was no way that Fran could stay put.  </p>
<p>「I’m going」</p>
<p>「Is it alone?  It’s not like scouting a village by myself, you know? No matter how much she has an alias...」</p>
<p>「Don’t worry」</p>
<p>「...Do you have any winnings?」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「... Okay.  I’ll make a request. It’s a defense request」</p>
<p>  Ooh!  I appreciate it! Fran may or may not have a request to go, but it’s better for her to be a merit!  </p>
<p>(Nn!  But first of all――)</p>
<p>『Fran?』</p>
<p>(This guy will definitely run away at this rate)</p>
<p>  Fran then pulled me out and stood in front of Dirk.  As a operative of Raidos, he probably already thought that she was like a goblin or a bandit. His eyes were on Dirk’s limbs.  And the tragedy that was caused by it.  To put it bluntly, I think it would be better to force her to become a slave than to lose her limbs... To Fran, becoming a slave was not like that.  Moreover, Satia pushed Fran to no avail when she was transferred to prison.  </p>
<p>「Come ‘ere ‘ere ‘ere. ’, </p>
<p>「Kii.」</p>
<p>「I’ll neutralize this man and keep an eye on him.」</p>
<p>「Kii!」</p>
<p>  Satia summoned a small, imp-like demon. When he looked like the heart magic had faded, he disappeared as if he had been sucked into the delinquent.  </p>
<p>「It’s a hearty of laziness. I won’t be able to completely neutralize someone as powerful as Dirk, but it is still possible to deprive you of your physical and mental strength.」</p>
<p>  In other words, he can make you think that you don’t want to do anything.  He has lost his limbs and is being watched by demons.  As expected, he won’t be able to escape from this state. Rather, I was more worried about assassination by Raydoss.  </p>
<p>「Fran-dono, don’t push yourself too hard, okay? We can get back to the town」</p>
<p>「I know」</p>
<p>  He was nodding his head now, but he was definitely going to be reckless when the time comes. Besides, as we learned from fighting in the Kingdom of Kranzel, Fran was not suited for defense.  Everything around her was just to protect, and she couldn’t get serious.  Fran seemed to feel that too. She jumped out of the Adventurer’s Guild and conveyed her thoughts to them.  </p>
<p>(Master)</p>
<p>『What’s wrong?』</p>
<p>(Let’s destroy Raydoss’s friends before they come to Barbra.)</p>
<p>『So you’re gonna beat them up and leave?』</p>
<p>  It may sound like it’s reckless, but Fran’s strength can be utilized by taking them back with a surprise attack at a larger location.</p>
<p>『You’re right...  Alright!</p>
<p>『You’re right... Alright! Let’s do it!』</p>
