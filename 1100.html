</div><h1>Chapter 1100</h1><p>「A-ah, yes...」</p>
<p>「This mansion is...」</p>
<p> Baron Noare and the maids went in with astonishment in their expressions. But because it was blocked by a huge wall, they wouldn’t be able to see the inside of it in detail. However, thunder magic rained down, and at the end, a huge thunderbolt should be able to be seen. A violent flash of light was emanating from the top of the open. However, Fran had a dissatisfied look on her face. It was probably because the owner of the presence has not yet come out. There was a hint of hiding in it, but she couldn’t find it. There was a hint of hiding, but I couldn’t find it.  </p>
<p>『You’re still going to do it?』</p>
<p>「I’ll do it!」</p>
<p>  Fran, who was determined to do it, struck her with even more magic. She thought that thunder magic would not work, and this time she used flame magic.  Countless flame spears rained down on the mansion many times.  The mansion, which was in a half-destructive state, had been completely destroyed. The rest of the mansion was also burned.  Moreover, that was not the only technique that Fran had unleashed. She sandwiched her newly learned magic, Area Purification, in between them. She must be thinking about the fact that the person she was hiding was undead.  And that was the only way to break out of this situation. </p>
<p>「Giiaaaaaahhh!」</p>
<p>「There’s something there!」</p>
<p>『Yeah, the presence suddenly began to thicken!  It’s an undead!』</p>
<p>  Suddenly, a powerful undead appeared inside the walls. It seems that Holy Magic had made it impossible for them to hide.  The robe they wore was tatters, but it looked like a magic tool.  My appraisal told me that it was a rather powerful concealment magic tool. However, Fran’s flame magic had burned half of it, and the effect was almost completely lost. It seemed that flame magic was also meaningful.  </p>
<p>『The combat power is lower than I expected. Your name is Hydman』</p>
<p>  Does that mean you’re pretty good at hiding?  If so, I’m convinced that you were a specialist in stealth.  In addition to skills such as Stealth, Stealth, Dilute, and Translucent, you also have skills for hiding and wading shadows. In addition, she had a unique skill called Existence Cloaking. In addition to his own abilities, he even had a robe to support it, which would give him tremendous stealth abilities.  Fran must’ve missed out on the magic she unleashed by diving into the shadows, but she couldn’t seem to block the wide area purification even when she was in the shadows. And she appeared out of the shadows, getting caught in the flames.  </p>
<p>「Guh...!  You little girl!」</p>
<p>「Are you a spy of the Raidos Kingdom?」</p>
<p>「...Hmph」</p>
<p>  Hydman didn’t answer Fran’s question and turned his gaze away. No, he was pretending to be like that while looking for an escape.  </p>
<p>「Urushi」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  He seemed to have tried to use his shadow transfer to escape, but Urushi immediately stopped him.  Urushi emerged from his shadow before he could dive into it.  He couldn’t use the shadows that other people were using.  If he used them, it would require more magic and interference than the opponent.  As a result, Hydman failed to teleport. Even though he was a high-level undead, he was no match for Urushi. He could raise his head as high as Urushi’s headbutt from below.  Fran rushed over and immediately slashed off his arms and legs, grabbed him tightly and captured him. Since he was an undead, he didn’t feel any pain or suffocation, but it didn’t matter.  </p>
<p>「Purification」</p>
<p>「Gyaaah!」</p>
<p>「Purification」</p>
<p>「Gyii!」</p>
<p>  Hydeman screamed every time he was hit by the Purification Magic, which was one of his weaknesses. The undead should have had no pain, but it seemed to be hard to be cleansed.  This was unintentionally replaced with torture. Hydman looked exhausted as his face was covered in pain that he had never felt before, and his entire body looked like a dry mummy, but his expression moved slightly. Hydman’s appearance was like a dry mummy’s, but his expression moved slightly.  As a result, I was able to read his emotions. Well, his mouth was still a bit harsh, but I was able to get some information from him by using the Principle of Falsehood.  This was apparently a high-ranking member of the Black Skeleton Corps of the Raydoss Kingdom, who came all this way here chasing after Dirk. However, the royal castle prison was very strict, and he had infiltrated Baron Noare’s house to see what was going on.  So, it was quite dangerous, huh? If the transfer of Dirk had been a little later, it might have been captured by Hydeman.  We came to the royal capital at once using Urushi’s legs, but how did we catch up with it? I thought it might be a tool for long-distance teleportation, but I was wrong.  It seemed that he just ran through the passage while hiding his presence. This was possible because he was an undead who did not feel fatigue and had little presence.  I guess it was because the interrogation so far had leaked a lot of information. Hydman was moaning in frustration.  </p>
<p>「I would never have liked for my information to be passed on to you...  The Black Skeleton Corps, seat 6 Hydman, has a lot of pain in his heart...」</p>
<p>「!」</p>
<p>『Fran!  Slayer!』</p>
<p>「Haaaah!」</p>
<p>  A tremendous amount of magic power gushed out of Hydman’s head.  It was almost as powerful as Extreme Magic. I didn’t know what he was trying to activate, but it was definitely not a luxury.  That was what we judged when we attacked Hydman. Fran’s slash sliced through Hydeman into a cross, and my flame magic made his head ashes.  </p>
<p>『Have you tried to stop him...』</p>
<p>「Nn...」</p>
<p>  It seemed that his head had a magic tool that caused a huge explosion. It might be like a self-determination device that could destroy the enemies around him and seal his mouth.  In the end, we couldn’t capture Hydman... Fran frowned in frustration as she stared at the remains of Hydeman falling into the mansion. But it was not that there was no harvest.  </p>
<p>『I heard that the Southern Duke is going to make some big move.Well, I’m sure Esmeralda was listening to us through the sand anyway.</p>
