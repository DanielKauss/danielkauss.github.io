</div><h1>Chapter 937</h1><p>「Die!」</p>
<p>「He won’t die」</p>
<p>「Damn! Give me a second!」</p>
<p>「Some temples!」</p>
<p>Even at the start of the battle, Isario did not draw any weapons. Instead, he did not attack and continued to evade our attacks.</p>
<p>Isario, smiling and ducking with a hairbreadth margin on his axe and his fellow swords, managed to dodge them all. Though he handled them lightly, I’m not too surprised so far. I’m sure Fran could do the same.</p>
<p>But he certainly did have a face. A drunk red face and a very irritated look on his face. I’m sure he was even more irritated by the red-scaled guy like that.</p>
<p>Against such an opponent, Zelos Reed heats up even more. Even though he has blood in his head, his movements did not lose sharpness. He said that he was a C-ranker, but his fighting ability was close to that of a B-ranker.</p>
<p>「Orra! Die! Shit!」</p>
<p>「Come on, come on, I think I’ll get a hit in a little while. Come on, hang in there, young man」</p>
<p>「Shiiit!」</p>
<p>Finally, Zelos Reed used martial arts. An axe, glistening in white, was launched out to the side. Then, for the first time, Isario showed signs of movement other than evasion.</p>
<p>She then reached the Divine Sword at her waist.</p>
<p>I thought we would finally be able to worship the Divine Sword, but my expectations were met. Isario did not draw his sword.</p>
<p>She lifted up her entire scabbard and used the hilt to catch the axe. As one would expect from a Divine Sword, its hilt was also said to be of a different level of strength.</p>
<p>Fran’s face scrunched up as she was able to easily catch one of her best blows. She couldn’t believe that her confidently unleashed killing technique had been blocked by her hilt.</p>
<p>「You now understand the difference in abilities, don’t you? Won’t you quit now?」</p>
<p>「I-Impossible! What kind of monster did you use!?」</p>
<p>Well, he was a man who came all the way to defeat the S-Ranked adventurer. There was no way he could quietly back down with this.</p>
<p>『Yeah, and that toughness... I don’t think it was just because of her high status』</p>
<p>From then on, he launched his axe crazy. His friends had already stopped in confusion. They must have realized the difference in abilities and decided to break their hearts.</p>
<p>「Urraaaaaah!」</p>
<p>「......Are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Nugaaaaah!」</p>
<p>「Haha, that’s just too powerful.」</p>
<p>「Guoooooh!」</p>
<p>The two were so passionate about this that I felt a little sorry for them. It wasn’t just me, the other adventurers seemed to think so too. They were watching over Zelos Reed with a slightly different expression on their faces.</p>
<p>That’s probably what he felt. Zelos Reed then became even more irritated.</p>
<p>「Don’t make fun of me, Zelos Reed!」</p>
<p>「If you don’t want to be ridiculed, then I’ll do my best. Come on.」</p>
<p>Isario was handling her attacks in the same condition as before. Sometimes he dodged them, sometimes he took them, and sometimes he didn’t even let them snatch at us.</p>
<p>I think I could dodge all of Isario’s moves if it was just his arm, but why was he being attacked on purpose? As I was observing him with doubt, I finally understood the meaning of Isario’s movements.</p>
<p>He seemed to have evaded ordinary attacks and only took powerful martial arts techniques that could cause damage to the surrounding area to offset the shockwaves.</p>
<p>Judging from the residue of the flying magic power, I could tell that what Zverb was unleashing was an advanced martial art. If fired normally, it would probably inflict serious injuries on the spectators.</p>
<p>It may look simple because of Isario’s light demeanor, but it does something very advanced.</p>
<p>First of all, his tremendous evasive power. And then his strength that could not be defeated by an axe. His ability to discern only wide area moves, his knowledge to know the details of those moves, his ability to move quickly, and his ability to deflect shocks.</p>
<p>All of that would have been impossible without a high level of security.</p>
<p>(Amazing.)</p>
<p>『Yeah. I wonder if even Fran could do that』</p>
<p>(...It’s kinda hard.)</p>
<p>Fran hates to lose, so it’s not impossible, but I’m sure it will be quite difficult.</p>
<p>Zelos Reed was also doing quite a bit of hard work, but after five minutes, his movements slowed down. Then, the battle suddenly ended.</p>
<p>「Guh...?」</p>
<p>「Yes, it’s over. I’m going to get tired of uncle again」</p>
<p>「Wha......?」</p>
<p>Zelos Reed’s leg suddenly stopped, and his huge body fell forward. From the way he breathed so much blood, I could tell that he had run out of strength.</p>
<p>She must have been too focused on offense to know her current condition. Perhaps Isario had pushed herself too hard to do something, but we didn’t know what she was doing.</p>
<p>「You guys, keep him with you, huh? I’d be glad if you don’t pick him up anymore if at all possible. He’ll give you a bit of a beating next time, okay?」</p>
<p>「Hyah! I-I understand!」</p>
<p>「He won’t show up in front of you anymore! So forgive him!」</p>
<p>「Yeah. I like kids who understand things」</p>
<p>In the end, the two were frightened by Isario’s intimidation and dragged Zelos Reed out of the way.</p>
<p>We’re lucky enough to have Rank S and think that’s all we got.</p>
<p>「Hey! You had a mock battle with me!」</p>
<p>「It’s no good」</p>
<p>「Why? I fought him!」</p>
<p>「You’ll get tired of fighting a girl as strong as the young miss, right?」</p>
<p>「At any rate, we need to take her down!」</p>
<p>「Mrgh.」</p>
<p>「Then the uncle will have a meeting with the guild master, so I’ll go now. See you again」</p>
<p>「Nn...」</p>
<p>In the end, the only thing we could do was to see off Isario, who was leaving while waving her hands. One of the adventurers called out to Fran as if to comfort her.</p>
<p>「Hahaha! Sorry for being so loud! I never thought that I’d hear such a thing like that!」</p>
<p>「Guh?」</p>
<p>「You don’t know him? He’s the alias of Isario’s husband, who uses the Divine Sword of Fire」</p>
<p>「You’re not a genius?」</p>
<p>「Oh, that one.」</p>
<p>The adventurer smiled bitterly as he told us about Isario. Apparently, when he first became an adventurer, he was ridiculed for not having the talent of a sword and called himself as weak.</p>
<p>Even now, when she became stronger and ascended to S rank, for some reason, she named her nickname “That time” like an alias.</p>
<p>「She’s a decently visible high-ranking adventurer after all. Not the average person though. She’s not a bad person」</p>
<p>「Hmm」</p>
