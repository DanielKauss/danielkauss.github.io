</div><h1>Chapter 1077</h1><p>Satya’s interrogation――no, torture was a disaster. To be honest, if we had a stomach, we might have returned. Fran and Urushi are looking at it well.</p>
<p>The agent certainly had pain nullification, so I didn’t feel any pain. But that didn’t mean I couldn’t feel it either.</p>
<p>Rather than the pain itself, I could feel the limbs slowly melting away and the fingers directly stroking my brain and heart. The fear of having my stomach sliced open and my body filled with small insects.</p>
<p>Satya was mentally cornered with various fears.</p>
<p>The way the expressionless face of the man who had been holding his ground gradually twisted in fear was so sympathetic that she almost forgot that he was the one who had almost killed Fran.</p>
<p>No matter how badly I did it, I wouldn’t end the torture because Satya would regenerate it. The melted arms earlier were now shaving off the flesh little by little, and I could see the bones off the stage. And then it was regenerated again, and the next thing I could continue to reap them was the tentacles.</p>
<p>For a man, this must be a nightmare.</p>
<p>The man still refused to speak. I’m impressed when he’s gone so far, but Satya isn’t panicking. Rather, she must have anticipated what the man would endure.</p>
<p>「You know how to withstand this? But how can you withstand this when your heart is weak?」</p>
<p>「......!」</p>
<p>Ronowe then grabbed the man’s torso and lifted it. It was a little weakened due to Fran’s slash, but it seemed to be fine enough for him to show up and wield some power.</p>
<p>With the mouth of the giant demon in front of him, the man didn’t even scream. On the contrary, he glared at Ronoue and said that he would never succumb.</p>
<p>A gray smoke then billowed from Ronowe’s mouth at him.</p>
<p>「Guh...」</p>
<p>Was it poison? As he kept blasting it over and over, his appearance changed little by little.</p>
<p>When I appraised the man, I found that he had multiple abnormalities, including daze, confusion, and self-destruct. He must have used poisons of various effects at the same time.</p>
<p>「Ah...... Ah......」</p>
<p>Emotions drained from the man’s face and he began to stare into the void as if in dismay. After confirming this, Satya asked the man a question.</p>
<p>「What’s your name?」</p>
<p>「...Derick Weston」</p>
<p>He answered obediently! I guess he had several abnormal conditions that made him confess. That was amazing.</p>
<p>However, it’s not the name that appears in my appraisal...... No, it immediately changed to Dick Weston. There were also a few more skills. In addition to Appraisal Disguising, the effect of the information concealment skill seemed to have deceived the information in my appraisal.</p>
<p>I see. So, they made it look like they had no problem hiding an important part in our feint, similar to how we’re using Appraisal Blocking and Appraisal Impersonation.</p>
<p>Satya looked at her lightly when she heard her name.</p>
<p>「Is this guy the Weston? I never thought I’d meet him in a place like this」</p>
<p>「He’s a celebrity?」</p>
<p>「Yes. No one at the top of our country knows about him. He is the head of the intelligence service possessed by the Western Duke. In other words, he is the pocket sword of the Western Duke」</p>
<p>「What the hell is that?」</p>
<p>He said that he had only gotten his name from the agent he had interrogated in the past. However, he was not known at all for his face, age, or other information, and was known as a legendary agent whose name only walked around alone.</p>
<p>Her fighting ability was at least that of a B-ranked adventurer, but her skills as a operative were quite impressive.</p>
<p>They freely changed their names and faces with disguise, appraisal, and illusion magic, and turned into others with skills in acting and acting. Then they infiltrated enemy areas and performed various operations with transfer, trap setting, and fraud skills.</p>
<p>It also had high concealment and presence concealment abilities. That’s why we won’t be able to catch it even if we search it normally.</p>
<p>「Urushi, you!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「What’s your purpose?」</p>
<p>「Personality of a demon knight......」</p>
<p>「What do you mean? Please explain」</p>
<p>「Yes...」</p>
<p>The hypnosis delinquent spoke with a wide-eyed look on his face.</p>
<p>There were several reasons why they used the villages of the Kranzel Kingdom to curse him. As Satya had predicted, they also intended to weaken Phyllius with the curse and distance himself from Kranzel.</p>
<p>However, their main goal was to kill the demon knights who came to stop the curse and obtain their bodies. They had planned to copy the appearance of the demon knights and infiltrate Philias’ core to take away their divine swords.</p>
<p>It was also said that the Eastern Duke wanted his corpse for the research of the demon knights. Because they were given forces and skills, the Western Duke could not repel their demands.</p>
<p>When it comes to Derick’s miscalculations, I’d say the appearance of his strong opponents, Fult and Satya. They didn’t expect the royalty, a valuable asset, to travel across the border while the North and the Sea were putting pressure on Philias.</p>
<p>「I was originally in the defense of the sea, but the Raidos fleet has disappeared after all」</p>
<p>It seems that our rampage in Barbra and Dards ended up being a breakdown of the plan. No, perhaps Fran’s biggest misjudgment was actually what she saw in Metelmum.</p>
<p>After one glance at Fran, Derick realized that he would never be able to beat her. Then he switched his goal to assassination of Fran.</p>
<p>「We know that only men in the royal family can inherit Diabolos. If we can kill the prince here, even if our strategy fails, we will be in good hands.」</p>
<p>「! I never thought I’d heard of it... Ah! F-Fran-san! No, please do something that I didn’t hear about right now...!」</p>
<p>「Nn. Okay」</p>
<p>「Thank you very much」</p>
<p>Only the royalty would inherit it, huh...? So that’s why they were aiming for Fran.</p>
<p>After that, Derick tried to escape and was captured by Urushi. He seemed to be confident in his escape, but it seemed that Urushi’s ability to track him exceeded him. Well, in fact, he had been on the run for a few hours, so if it wasn’t Urushi, he would have been on the run.</p>
<p>Fran stroked Urushi again.</p>
<p>「Urushi, good boy」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>After that, we learned about the plans of the Western Duke and his internal affairs. With this information, we would be able to gain an advantage over the Western Duke.</p>
<p>「Hey, I want to ask you something too」</p>
<p>「Please」</p>
<p>「......Illegal slaves are sent to the Raidos Kingdom from the west of the Kranzel Kingdom. Are you buying them from the Western Duke?」</p>
<p>「That’s right.」</p>
<p>「......Why are you buying illegal slaves?」</p>
<p>What Fran was interested in was the illegal slaves. If I hadn’t been careful, I might have been sent to the Raidos Kingdom too. So, I’m sure she was curious.</p>
<p>「 Soldiers, miners, farmers, servants. adults can use it as much as they want, and children should be sent to the north.」</p>
<p>「The north?」</p>
<p>「The Northern Duke is buying up children. I don’t know what he’s using it for, but unpopular races like the Black Cat kin and Fishmen can also sell it at high prices」</p>
<p>「What do you mean?」</p>
<p>He was one of the Dukes of Raidos, so I’m sure he didn’t use him for anything. It was at the moment when the Northern Duke’s name was engraved on Fran’s murder list.</p>
<p>「Old people and people injured that have no way of using it are using it as a sacrifice」</p>
<p>「Prear?」</p>
<p>Fran’s mutterings exuded killing intent. However, Derick continued to tell the truth.</p>
<p>「This is a sacrifice that takes out magic power and a curse when making a knife to kill demons. Since it takes more than a hundred people to make one, you need as many slaves as you want」</p>
<p>「......!」</p>
<p>『Fran, wait! You’ll die if you hit it! We have to save you as a valuable witness!』</p>
<p>「......!」</p>
<p>Fran clicked a nearby tree to let out a helpless rage. With a fierce impact, the tree trunk was broken, and Fran’s hands were covered in blood.</p>
<p>『Let your anger go. We’ll fight against the Kingdom of Raidos anyway.』</p>
<p>「......Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran wouldn’t stop now. She must be actively involved in the battle against Raydoss. The killing intent that Fran unleashed right now was so strong that it made me convinced that it had been confirmed.</p>
<p>But still, I guess these demon-killing knives were mass-produced...? Derick himself didn’t know how to make them. However, of course, he knew who made them. The person who made them was the alchemist Ansel. To my surprise, he was a specialist in divine sword research and a disciple of Zelyse.</p>
<p>His research on the Divine Sword, Zelyse’s magic stone knowledge, the Pseudo Fanatic Sword’s data, and the actual magic sword used to kill demons. All of this together made it possible to mass-produce a sword capable of killing demons.</p>
