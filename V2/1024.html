</div><h1>Chapter 1024</h1><p>Jayne’s release of necronomicon’s abilities was not limited to summoning the heroic spirits of past divine sword wielders. </p>
<p>「Come on, come on, bring it on! Come on, bring it on! Those who writhed in the twilight! March of the Dead!」</p>
<p> Jayne summoned more than a hundred High Ghosts. Each was a higher-level species that dealt in magic, and had physical permeability that could not be defeated by physical attacks. In addition, she could even handle ritual magic under Jayne’s command. In addition, they could even handle ritual magic under Jayne’s command.  Such vicious spirits had been enhanced by Necronomicon and Sophie’s magical songs. Each one of them seemed to be in a threat level of B class.  Sophie must have understood from the appearance of Isario and Zefmate that the match was on the line.  Mea, Hilt, Zefmate, and Colbert appeared as if they were guarding Sophie. They had managed to withstand that tremendous fall in attack.  I had assumed she would not die, but she seemed to be doing fine.  Isario’s flames, Jayne’s High Ghost, and the attacks of Mea, soldiers, and adventurers with Sophie’s support, gradually cut down the body of the giant antidemons. With the cooperation of the three divine swords, they were able to exceed the regeneration power of the antidemons even without unleashing any major moves.  The most vicious thing was Isario’s flames. He had turned the antidemon’s body into ashes little by little due to his superior attack power. But that was not the case if I were to ask if Isario was in perfect condition.  </p>
<p>(Isario...  is he down?)</p>
<p>『Yeah.  His movements are obviously slowing down.』</p>
<p>  Isario’s level seemed to have dropped considerably after using the Divine Sword for a long time. If he pushed himself any further, it would really be life-threatening.  Jayne was also worried.  </p>
<p>「Ahahahaha!  I’ll crush you with everything I’ve got!」</p>
<p>  At first glance, he looked like he was in high spirits and had a bad complexion. Originally, his skin was pale, but now it could be called pale. </p>
<p>「Jayne, are you okay?」</p>
<p>「I’m gonna have to say a little more! But it’s tougher than expected, and I miscalculate the durability of the Great Magic Beast?」</p>
<p>  What a big deal? Either way, it seems that the giant antidemons are harder than expected. Jayne said lightly, but the divine sword must be using a lot of magic power.  </p>
<p>「Like I thought, you should――」</p>
<p>「Come on, wait.  That was what I said earlier, right?  I told you to leave it to us adults. The name of the Demon Lord would be annihilated if you continued to sacrifice children.」</p>
<p> Jayne stopped the hydrangea when she tried to readied Berserk again.  </p>
<p>「Behold, our national treasure, the trump card of the necronomicon! Well, it will take a while though.」</p>
<p>  She seems to have a trump card, similar to the Evil God’s Slayer from Adam. The divine power emitted by the Necronomicon gradually increased in intensity.  I wanted to stop the hydrangea from dying, but Fran would be sad if Jayne died. I didn’t want her to be reckless, but that couldn’t be the case. Thanks to the supply of magic power from the Abyss Eater, my regeneration speed seemed to have increased dramatically compared to the beginning.  Obviously, she was getting stronger.  Even though her body was crushed, I could feel that only her magic power increased. Once I retreated and came back, I thought I was getting stronger enough that I couldn’t touch it.  </p>
<p>「We’re going」</p>
<p>『Yeah』</p>
<p>「!」</p>
<p>  Fran just ran off with determination.  A scream leaked out of her mouth. It wasn’t that we had been attacked.  </p>
<p>「Isario!」</p>
<p>  It seemed that the giant antidemons had pooled their power while pretending to be immune to it. The reason for this was probably to deliver a blow to eliminate the most troublesome Isario. I saw a magic bullet released from one of the giant antidemons’ eyes breaking through Isario’s defenses and blown away.  Sensing that a follow up strike was about to be placed on Isario as he rolled on the ground, Fran jumped out at once. Before she could kick the ground, she turned into black lightning and jumped between the antidemons and Isario.  </p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>『Fran!  Oh!  Shit!』</p>
<p>  As expected of an attack that would blow Isario away!  The barrier was easily pierced through, and Fran and I were blown away.  With just one blow, my blade was severely cracked. Fran also broke her arms and had taken a lot of damage.  But that didn’t stop her.  </p>
<p>『Fran!  The next one is coming!』</p>
<p>「Nn...!」</p>
<p>  While I was healing, Fran landed on the ground and ran straight ahead.  She held Isario away without killing her momentum, twisting her body and dodging the magic bullets. The magic bullets sniffed her and scraped the cat’s ears, causing her blood to fly.  Magic bullets were released one after another to Fran, who was running with Isario under her arm. I guess she had no intention of letting Isario escape.  </p>
<p>『Isario! </p>
<p>「... I’m so sorry!  Thank you! I was just trying to unleash something big, but I was a little late moving...」</p>
<p>  It looks like she’ll be okay.  It seemed that her defenses had been slightly neglected due to her continued accumulation of magic power. Even now, I could see that a large amount of magic power was still maintained in Isario.  The barrage of magic became even thicker as if he was trying to stop it. Now that Isario’s flames had stopped, he was able to channel more of his power and magic power into his attacks.  </p>
<p>「Fran, throw me away!  I’m gonna be fine now!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p> Isario, who had moved away from Fran’s hand, rolled down on the ground to kill his momentum and ran off in the opposite direction from Fran. I guess he had tried to keep his distance so that Fran wouldn’t be attacked any further.  However, by rescuing Isario, Fran was also the target of the antidemons’ attacks.  Magic bullets flew into us at the same time as Isario.  No, considering the time it took for Isario and Jayne’s trump card to be activated, isn’t that really a good thing? But their attacks were too violent!  Fran managed to avoid a direct hit just in time, but it would be too dangerous if this continued.  Both Fran and I had been exhausted after such a fierce battle. Our movements had dropped considerably.  Even so, Fran saw through the magic bullets and avoided them with a Threshold.  However, the compressed magic bullets released by the antidemons were more powerful than we had expected. After defending against the magic bullets several times, my blade snapped in half.  </p>
<p>「Master!」</p>
<p>『Don’t worry!  More importantly, don’t dodge!』</p>
<p>「Kuaaa!」</p>
<p>『Fran!  Don’t be so reckless!』</p>
<p>「Kuh...  It’s okay!」</p>
<p>  She hesitated to use them because she was afraid that I might break it further.  After forcibly repelling the magic bullet with her arm. The tip of Fran’s right elbow flew off with a tornado.  I activated my healing magic while flying through the air with a torn hand.  Both Fran and I quickly closed our wounds with instant regeneration. However, because of the damage, Fran’s legs were tangled lightly and she was late to escape. </p>
<p>『Uwooorgh!』</p>
<p>  I slipped in so that I could become Fran’s shield. I wonder how long I could withstand the barrier with its maximum strength?  I could see Fran’s face contort in pain. But the worst future Fran could imagine did not come.  There was even more people between me and Fran.  She managed to block the magic bullet by putting up a barrier.  It seemed that her arms had been broken, but blood did not flow out of her.  On the contrary, she didn’t seem to feel any pain.  Well, that was obvious. After all, she was a golem. </p>
<p>「I’m going to jump」</p>
<p>  The silver-haired woman jumped at once, holding Fran in her arms. Using her magic release, she glided through the air.  </p>
<p>「Why are you here?」</p>
<p>「As for Nadia-sama, I leave it to Mulsani, the merchant.The one who answered her was a golem that looked just like a man created by the divine blacksmith Zechs.The one who answered her was a golem that looked just like a man created by the divine blacksmith Zechs. It was the Silver Lady.</p>
