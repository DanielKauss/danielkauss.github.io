</div><h1>Chapter 998</h1><p>「Ugyaaah!」</p>
<p>「Velmeria!」</p>
<p>「Grrrrr!」</p>
<p>『No! You haven’t heard my voice!』</p>
<p>「Kuh......!」</p>
<p>Even when Fran called out to her, Velmeria didn’t respond. She was completely mentally manipulated.</p>
<p>I’m sure Fran was going to disable it without killing it, but it would be quite difficult. Rather, it should be easier to kill it.</p>
<p>However, I don’t think Fran would abandon Velmeria.</p>
<p>『...Fran. She has no reason, and she’s coming with all her might. It’s not a good idea to prolong this』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p>Velmeria and Frederick were now full throttle, willing to take themselves out. Like in their Potential Release state, I could tell that their vitality was starting to decrease even before the battle started.</p>
<p>If we had been keeping an eye on him, he might have died on his own. We had to either knock him out as soon as possible or inflict damage and hold him back until he is unable to move.</p>
<p>I was keeping an eye on the movements of the robe bastard, but he seemed to rarely look at us. He hardly moved at all and seemed to be concentrating on something.</p>
<p>『Fran, are you sure you want to use that sword?』</p>
<p>However, she shouldn’t get in our way while we’re focused on the other side.</p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>「Uruaaa!」</p>
<p>Fran activated her Brilliant Lightning Rush and went into full power mode at once, but Velmeria also took her gear up a notch.</p>
<p>Fran had the advantage in terms of sword reach. And Velmeria’s evil energy was probably the real trouble.</p>
<p>I began to release so much evil energy that I thought I had turned into an evil dragonkin. The evil energy disrupted the telekinesis and checking magic I released and canceled it out. If I put in a lot of magic power, it wouldn’t be affected by the evil energy, but it was still very exhausting.</p>
<p>Mental manipulation, evil energy, just like the dragonkin who attacked us on the way. Is it even possible to subdue them? Don’t you want to keep fighting until the end of the day?</p>
<p>Fran moved fast while firing black lightning, and Velmeria began to exceed that speed while firing blue magic power.</p>
<p>Apparently, she wasn’t serious yet. No, she must have pushed herself even harder in line with Fran. Velmeria’s life force lessened even faster.</p>
<p>「Ugyaaaaah!」</p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>『All I have to do is take one hit and my durability value will be taken over instantly!』</p>
<p>I couldn’t teleport because of the full amount of magic power released by the Abyss Eater’s core. That was why I couldn’t use the emergency evasion before.</p>
<p>Urushi was unable to hide into the shadows, and was unable to interfere with Fran and the others’ high-speed battles.</p>
<p>Little by little, Fran had more time to defend herself. Like I thought, she was not an opponent who could win when she was holding back so as not to kill her.</p>
<p>Even though her physical stats were increasing, her martial arts skills level was still low, so Fran, who still had Sword King Skill, was able to respond. However, if the battle was prolonged and she was becoming more exhausted, her balance would suddenly shift.</p>
<p>I had tried many times to find a breakthrough, but the appraisal didn’t go well. It was top-notch, and my Evil Spirit was in the way of it.</p>
<p>Still, when I used appraisal with more Divine Attributes than ever, I was able to appraise Velmeria for a moment.</p>
<p>It only used appraisal over and over again, and it drained a lot of magic power. But it was worth the effort.</p>
<p>Name: Velmeria―</p>
<p>Race: Half-―</p>
<p>Status: Domination, Evil Erosion, Divine Dragon――</p>
<p>Stator――</p>
<p>HP: 1027/18</p>
<p>MP: 301</p>
<p>[Skill]</p>
<p>Foot Sense: Lv7, Intimidation: Lv8, Super Strength Lv3, Crisis Sense: Lv5, Fist Arts: Lv8, Fist Mastery: LvMax, Fist Saint――</p>
<p>[Unique Skill]</p>
<p>Energy Control, Super Dragon Scales――</p>
<p>Extra Skills</p>
<p>Divine Dragon Form</p>
<p>Titles</p>
<p>The Blue Dragon God――</p>
<p>To be honest, I couldn’t see half of them. However, I was able to confirm the important part.</p>
<p>『Fran, Velmeria is still a Divine Dragon! And with that skill!』</p>
<p>(......! Skilltaker!)</p>
<p>『Yeah!』</p>
<p>We knew when we took away Ashwrath’s Mad Ogre, that if he lost his skills, the changes would be lessened. Although there were some areas of interest, such as control and Evil Spirit Erosion, there was no doubt that his fighting power would be greatly reduced if he lost his Divine Dragon Form.</p>
<p>『I’ve been saving this skill for a while now! Let’s use it!』</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
<p>I activated my skill taker on Velmeria. The invisible skill arm touched Velmeria’s soul, and I could clearly feel a sense of taking away something.</p>
<p>『Uwooh! I-it’s gonna work on me too!』</p>
<p>Immediately after I took out the Divine Dragon Form, a tremendous amount of power erupted from within me. Was this the Divine Attribute? There was more evil mixed in too.</p>
<p>Apparently, the enhancements to my skills were extended to me as well. It didn’t even have to be a dragonkin to get meaningful experiences.</p>
<p>Just like my Mad Ogre, it must belong to me when I take away the skill that was active.</p>
<p>『Fran, Urushi, now!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Fran’s kick blasted Velmeria away. Velmeria was no longer Fran’s enemy after losing her Divine Dragon Form.</p>
<p>My land magic intervened with Velmeria, whose paw Urushi had chased after and was flicked away again as she tried to get up. I also held back Velmeria with telekinesis to hinder her movements. She should be able to start moving soon, but that should be enough for now.</p>
<p>『Isario and Frederick, you support me as I can maintain my Divine Dragon Form!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
