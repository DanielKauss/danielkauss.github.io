</div><h1>Chapter 965</h1><p>When we arrived in Sendia, we saw many adventurers following the wall’s defenses. They must be on the lookout for the reappearance of the giant antidemons――the giant-type. As soon as we entered the town, people were staring at us. They were not looking at Isario, but at Fran. There was no negative feeling in her gaze, rather, they were welcome. They also called out to her from time to time. She was calling her “Saintess-sama’s friend”, “Black Cat Princess-san”, and many other names. We were called by various names, such as “Saintess-sama’s friends” or “Black Cat Princess-san”.  Most of them were words of gratitude for saving the town and the saintess. Isario was famous, but I guess Fran was more popular in this town right now.  </p>
<p>「Oi oi, aren’t you super popular?」</p>
<p>「Is that so?」</p>
<p>  Isario even smirked and patted Fran’s shoulder in a teary.  But as for Fran, she’s seen Isario at the guild and Sophie’s popularity in this town. Besides, she’s been very welcome in the Black Cat Kin’s village before.  That’s probably why she doesn’t think they’re so popular just because of him. As we were walking around, we met a familiar face.  She didn’t remember his name, but he was just a thug from the Beastmen Union.  He was a old rat-type beastman. I’ve seen her staying with Mea a few times already.  </p>
<p>「Sis!  You’ve gone now, aren’t you!?」</p>
<p>  She was smiling happily after Fran called her. To the beastmen, Fran was like an idol they’ve always dreamed of. </p>
<p>「Do you know where Mea, Sophie, and Velmeria are now?」</p>
<p>「Yeah!  I can’t help but think that these two are right there in the hideout!  But it seems Velmeria and that little dragonkin girl are right there. They haven’t seen her lately.」</p>
<p>「Who are those guys from Silard?」</p>
<p>「Are they not from the inn?」</p>
<p>  Apparently they are still in town for the time being.  </p>
<p>「Can you show them around?」</p>
<p>「Please」</p>
<p>「Yeah!」</p>
<p>  Fran would have to check on Mea and Sophie’s safety to calm herself down. Isario didn’t seem to be complaining because it was important to have the cooperation of the town’s leaders. As she walked along, she told us what happened when that giant-type appeared.  The town seemed to have been in complete chaos after the appearance of another giant-type near Sendia. They had defeated the horde of antidemons, but they had yet to be attacked again.  Besides, the collapsed walls have not been repaired yet, and the reconstruction was not over. It was the worst time to be attacked.  Still, the towers, the Beastmen Union, the dragonkin, and the guild were working together to try to counter them. With the help of the saintess, Mea, and Velmeria, they seemed to have high morale.  However, an even greater reinforcement appeared than expected.  To their surprise, an army attacked the giant-type and its men from behind. They were the knights of Silard, the Holy Nation. Their lure almost no harm to the town, as only a few of them were injured by the tremor. In the end, the town’s forces raided and destroyed the antidemons that were distracted by the knights.  The holy knights apparently suffered a lot of damage. The rat praised them for reevaluating the holy knights.  </p>
<p>「Well, our attacks didn’t work on the big ones, but it’ll be on Mea’s side and Saintess-sama. They teamed up with the Divine Sword Knights to defeat the big monsters in no time at all!」</p>
<p>  Adar may have been able to defeat it on his own, but Mea and Zefmate must have really done it in an instant. But still, how could the holy knights save Sendia at their own expense?  The holy knights, who were highly conscious of their chosen people, must have looked down on the illegal city. I don’t think there was any way they could save Sendia at any cost if they sacrificed their subordinates. I would imagine Silard as someone who could simply shove the antidemons against Sendia and kidnap her.My impression of Silard was that he would simply shove the antidemons against Sendia and kidnap them with whatever they eat.  But for the time being, I could tell that Sophie was safe and the holy knights didn’t do anything strange in the town.  While talking to the beastmen, we quickly arrived at our destination.  The entrance gatekeeper remembered Fran, and he walked straight through with ease.  </p>
<p>「Oh!  Wasn’t that Fran!? She’s back!」</p>
<p>「Are you okay with Mea?  The giant antidemons, Silard, etc...」</p>
<p>「Indeed, we didn’t get any injuries.  The holy knights seemed to have been pretty good, though.」</p>
<p> Sophie seemed to be in a different place, and Mea was the only one who greeted her.  </p>
<p>「Isn’t that man......  Isario-dono!」</p>
<p>「Aah, was he the daughter of the Beast King?」</p>
<p>「You know her?」</p>
<p>「I’ve only greeted her.  Well, it’s just that I know Isario-dono one-sidedly. As a wielder of fire, I can’t ignore him!」</p>
<p>  There was a hint of pure respect in Mea’s eyes. Although Mea was a race and a job that controlled fire, she seemed to respect Isario as a superior. She must have gathered a lot of information from him, even if it was only a matter of meeting him in person. </p>
<p>「Shaking your hand!」</p>
<p>「You’ve probably met him before, haven’t you?」</p>
<p>「I’m begging you over and over again!」</p>
<p>「W-Well, that’s fine.  But more importantly, I’ve heard that the holy knights of Silard saved this town. Is it true?」</p>
<p>「Aah, Is that so......」</p>
<p>  Mea told us the truth with a wry smile. </p>
<p>「Fortunately for us, they got caught up in it on their own.」</p>
<p> It seems the holy knights weren’t trying to save Sendia, but a giant-type beast just appeared in front of the knights.  At first they tried to escape, but they were surrounded by gushing antidemons, making it impossible for them to escape. The truth was that Sendia had made proper use of that. Mea had also heard about the terms of the agreement between the Holy Nation and the Medical Director, but since Addle was exhausted, she now thought she would not attack Sophie.  Silard must have said that he saved her in order to reap some of the benefits. It was actually quite a bother, even though she had been caught in Mea’s story.  While we were talking with Mea, a new figure appeared from behind us.  It was Quina, Mea’s servant. </p>
<p>「I have just given you my message, so I’m sure the saintess will be right away.」</p>
<p>  She had ordered one of her beastmen to send Sophie to call her. </p>
<p>「Hmm, aren’t you being senile?  Quina!」</p>
<p>「It’s not the same as the young lady from somewhere standing and talking without tea, so...... I-I was thinking of launching my own!I-I was about to serve you!  Prepare the tea!」</p>
<p>「I’ve got it ready in the back, so please go ahead.」</p>
<p>「...... Fu-fuhaha!It was the same master and servant as ever.</p>
