</div><h1>Chapter 1125</h1><p>On the fifth day of Fran’s Bootcamp, we were going to arrive at our destination, the frontline camp, today. We were no longer running because we were just ordinary guards. However, Fran still called the warriors “goblins” and the warriors continued to follow the mysterious rule of currying all the endings. At the very least, no malice or hostility was detected from the warriors, and they were now more serious about their work. At the very least, no malice or hostility had been received from the warriors, and they were becoming more serious about their work.  No one was doing anything rash before our departure, and there were still serious soldiers there, just a little stern. They moved with a tingle, spoke with a tingle, and were absolutely obedient to Fran’s orders.  They couldn’t move on their own, and there were no more fights at all. On the contrary, they were even giving each other encouragement and helping each other.  Even to me, they were as serious as if they were reincarnated. At this rate, I don’t think they’ll be able to get caught by Mareficent and slam into their training hell.  I’m not sure what will happen to Fran’s rank-up though. However, it seemed that this transportation event, which had been going on for a long time, was not over without incidents.  </p>
<p>(Master.  Something’s coming)</p>
<p>『There’s quite a lot going on.  Moreover...』</p>
<p>(Evil Spirit.)</p>
<p>『Yeah.』</p>
<p>  A large group of people were approaching us who didn’t even try to hide their will to fight. At first I thought they were scouts of Raydoss, but that didn’t seem to be the case. The group emitted evil energy.  It didn’t seem to be a human being, and it seemed to be a swarm of evil people.  Moreover, some of them were quite strong. They were probably just small fry like goblins or kobolds.  </p>
<p>『I guess we can get out of here.』</p>
<p>(Nn.  We’ll intercept them.)</p>
<p>  enemy territory, evil energy, and fighting intent.  It would be unthinkable to be together as an enemy. Fran began to give instructions to the valiant soldiers, thinking that there would be a battle between them.  </p>
<p>「There will be people approaching.  Protect the carriage!」</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Yes!  Commander! Curry!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>  Until at a time like this......  Well, that’s fine though.  I guess that’s just how serious she was.  </p>
<p>「Mareficent, Persona. If it’s too dangerous for everyone, I’ll cover for you」</p>
<p>「Well, it’s an emergency...」</p>
<p>  As expected, she didn’t say that she only did chores like this. With this, we can manage most of our opponents. Fran, who is equivalent to an A-ranked adventurer, is now joined by an active A-ranked and B-ranked adventurer.  They do not proceed any further, but wait in the plains with few shields. Then, in about ten minutes, the group in question appeared.  </p>
<p>(Undead.)</p>
<p>『Yeah, the one in the center is quite strong.』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p>  There were about twenty undead.  Moreover, all of them were of the highest class, the Genoside Ghoul. The ghoul in the center of the room in particular had an overwhelming amount of evil energy. It was at a level where the valiant soldiers’ faces pale in the face of the evil energy leaking out.  Perhaps Threat Level B would not be low. If it had been raised by the evil energy, it might have reached A.  It was a force that even a small country could defeat by itself. So, it was not a group that could show up in a place like this.  I think they were the Black Skeleton Corps, but what about the Evil Spirits? Could they have developed a technique to strengthen the undead with Evil Spirits? Maybe they had used their power to eliminate Rank A adventurers.  Fran shouted out to the undead that rushed toward her.  </p>
<p>「Hold it there! If we get any closer, we’ll consider them enemies!」</p>
<p>  It may sound pointless, but I just wanted to know what they were after. That’s why I called out to them just in case, but...  The undead suddenly stopped moving.  Eh? Did they show such hostility?  But it was not that they stopped after hearing our warning. </p>
<p>『They’re chanting a spell!』</p>
<p>「Long-range attacks begin!」</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Curry!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>  In the end, the end of the battle ended without anyone getting any information. Magic and arrows flew through the air, and sometimes even stones were thrown in.  However, they failed to decisively strike each other at a long distance attack.  As they were the most powerful type of ghoul, they unleash a series of deadly poison spells. However, the other side was also deployed with evil barriers, so our attacks could not hit them.However, they also deployed an evil barrier over them, so they couldn’t get hit by our attacks.  Fran and Persona’s magic would be able to reach them, but it would be less powerful and less of a decisive blow, and they would be regenerated quickly.  After a few minutes of shooting, they both dropped off.  Then the next step would be close combat.  The Genoside Ghouls and the others had skidded through the long-range attacks and thinned their flesh as a group. Moreover, twenty ghouls were concentrated in a single place.  </p>
<p>『They’re going after Fran!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  Did they know they were the commander?  Or were they trying to get rid of the healers first? Either way, their guesses were wrong.  </p>
<p>「Gigyii!  Now, little girl!</p>
<p>「That divine vessel!</p>
<p>「That divine vessel! I am worthy of that divine vessel!」</p>
