</div><h1>Chapter 1009</h1><p>Trismegistus raised his sword lightly and said nothing in return.</p>
<p>「I heard that Juanaverta is still worth using. It would be a problem if he died here」</p>
<p>So this sword was really an intelligence weapon!</p>
<p>That’s what he said, in a very fierce tone. He must have a deep grudge against this Dragon King for erasing his ancestors.</p>
<p>That meant the possibility existed for a connection between him and the slavers. But that didn’t turn out to be the case.</p>
<p>「I’ll kill you too!」</p>
<p>「I see, you can do however you want」</p>
<p>I wonder what kind of relationship those two really were.</p>
<p>Trismegistus, who had interrupted the conversation with Meritte, turned his back on her as if saying that the conversation was over.</p>
<p>But this time it was Fran who made the first move.</p>
<p>They knew that they couldn’t kill him, and that they would be defeated by Fran if Trismegistus came back to death here.</p>
<p>The King of the Dragonmen hated him so much that he couldn’t help but say that he would die if he wasn’t protected. The whiteness of his lip after being bitten showed just how much emotion he had in store for us.</p>
<p>Fran calmly opened her mouth in front of the transcendent who had suddenly stood.</p>
<p>「You’re friends with Meritte?」</p>
<p>「No, you’re wrong. However, her talent is rare. Therefore, it is a pity to kill her.」</p>
<p>「A talent?」</p>
<p>「It was a talent for using the Discarded Divine Sword. Even though it was not officially numbered, it was originally created to be a Divine Sword. Not just anyone could handle it, but it was wielding two at the same time. It worked very well with Zechs’ Discarded Divine Sword」</p>
<p>I knew it. Those two swords were handmade by the divine blacksmith Zechs. He was a rare divine blacksmith, because the swords he made were not recognized by the Gods and not a single divine sword could be created.</p>
<p>I’m sure Overgrowth was also created by Zechs. Although Zechs’ sword was called the Discarded Divine Sword, it seemed to have not been really discarded.</p>
<p>Judging from the words of Trismegistus, a Semi-Divine Sword that was not officially recognized as a Divine Sword was probably called a Discarded Divine Sword at once.</p>
<p>「Falldown, the Heavenly Sword that gives you the power to control evil energy instead of turning you into an evil person. Evil Eater, the Evil Erosion Sword that allows you to control antidemons instead of turning your body into antidemons. Both of them are treated at the same time and maintain their sanity.」</p>
<p>I see now, I somehow figured out how Meritte’s control abilities function.</p>
<p>A sword capable of controlling evil energy and a sword capable of controlling antidemons. In addition, the Evil God’s leader possessed by Wisteria’s bloodline. By bringing all of these together, it should be possible to control antidemons and evil dragonkin.</p>
<p>Could the power of the two failed divine swords also be the power to create antidemons? Judging from the fact that they were stuck in the core of the Abyss Eater, could Evil Eater really give them an order?</p>
<p>「If you leave immediately, I won’t chase you.」</p>
<p>「What’s Merit...... are you going to do?」</p>
<p>「I don’t feel the need to answer that.」</p>
<p>「Kuh......!」</p>
<p>I also wanted to ask him more questions, but Trismegistus did not allow that. He suddenly slashed at us without a trace of hostility.</p>
<p>「Hou? You want to react?」</p>
<p>He wielded the Juanaverta in his hand while being impressed. His slash was accurate and sharp, but he was not as hostile or wary as ever.</p>
<p>This was the first time that their atmosphere and behavior had not been intertwined like this. Moreover, his sword skills were more than equal with Fran’s.</p>
<p>(She’s strong!)</p>
<p>『This guy is definitely at the level of the Sword King Technique!』</p>
<p>They have been wielding their swords on the continent of Gordicia for many years. It may not be possible to do so without mastering it.</p>
<p>Fran looked excited again and began to counterattack.</p>
<p>「Taaah!」</p>
<p>「I see, will she use the Sword King Skill? I can also see that Juanaverta sees the sword as dangerous. Hmm? It’s just useful? I see.」</p>
<p>Trismegistus suddenly muttered to himself. That must be his telepathy. Maybe both Fran and I can see something like that from the outside.</p>
<p>「This is the first time I’ve seen an Intelligence Weapon other than Juanaverta」</p>
<p>「!! How, can you tell?」</p>
<p>「Juanaverta has a talent in information analysis. It’s easy to intercept someone’s telepathy. I’d like to analyze it, but if I don’t get it, my second-in-command tells me to destroy it. I’ll destroy it」</p>
<p>So she steals my telepathy and finds out what I’m talking about! I disguised myself with Appraisal Blocking and Concealment, but I guess it’ll be possible to guess what I’m talking about if it was revealed.</p>
<p>And apparently, it was considered dangerous by Juanaverta.</p>
<p>「You’re gonna destroy Master......?」</p>
<p>「If I give it to you now, it won’t hurt you, you know?」</p>
<p>「Don’t be ridiculous...!」</p>
<p>Fran got angry at Trismegistus for declaring that she was going to destroy me.</p>
<p>Her murderous intent was so devastating that even I could feel a chill in her eyes.</p>
<p>That Isario even trembled with his back muscles trembled.</p>
<p>When a person who didn’t know anything saw the current Fran, they would think that she was crazy. I couldn’t feel any hint of rationality in the current Fran.</p>
<p>Fran let loose a wild roar like an animal and slammed me with that killing intent.</p>
<p>「Uraaaaah!」</p>
<p>「Nice move」</p>
