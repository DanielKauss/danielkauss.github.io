</div><h1>Chapter 1026</h1><p>《The excess magic power will be returned to the individual named Master.》</p>
<p>『Such magic power!』</p>
<p>《The current individual named Master can control it. You need to focus on the Great Wizard skill.》</p>
<p>『O-Okay!』</p>
<p> As Announcer-san said, it was possible to keep a huge amount of magic power leaking out of him and control it. It might get foggy over time, but I could just focus all of it on the next attack. However, there was something that had been bothering me a little while concentrating. </p>
<p>『Hey, Announcer-san. Did you just call me the individual named Master?』</p>
<p> Did you just call me the individual named Master?』</p>
<p>《Yes.  By assimilating me with the bearer of hope, the status of my existence has increased.  As a result, the naming of me from the Divine Territories had been completed. We judged that it was an emergency and the notice was temporarily frozen》</p>
<p>『You mean you used your caution to avoid hitting us with useless words?  Or did you just give it a name?  Seriously? So, you’re saying it has become a named item?』</p>
<p>  It’s the same existence as Fran’s armor, right? And was it different from the Divine Sword?  </p>
<p>《The individual named Master, the human sword, has become the real name. They’re not a Divine Sword》</p>
<p>『I-isn’t that right?  Even so, the name is not much different though. I mean, a Human Sword...』</p>
<p>  Isn’t it that dull?  It’s not that it’s just a magic sword, a Spirit Sword, a Fire Sword, or a Dragon Sword!  There are many cool names for it, but I’m the only person?  A Human Sword?  That’s not wrong, but it looks weak!  Because it’s a Human Sword, doesn’t it?  Wouldn’t it be better if it was more different?  A Divine Sword and a Human Sword! There’s a big difference just by the cloudiness on it, aren’t it?  Besides, is this something that I’m happy about?  </p>
<p>『Doesn’t there a disadvantage to me? For example, I can’t eliminate my feelings like the Me over there』</p>
<p>《No problems.  All the negative effects of naming are defendable by the individual named Announcer-san》</p>
<p>『I knew it!  The negative effects!』</p>
<p>  Are you sure you’ll be okay?  It would be pretty bad if it affected even a little!  </p>
<p>《It’s because of the increase in rationality and loss of emotions.  They are originally the characteristics of the individual named Announcer-san, and now I’ve built a barrier based on the personality and emotional data obtained from the power of the individual named Hope’s bearer. It is possible to prevent the sword adaptation of the individual named Master》</p>
<p>『In other words, Announcer-san looks like a normal mechanical person, but she has the power of a hope bearer, so you don’t have to worry about it now?』</p>
<p>《Yes》</p>
<p>『Are you sure you’re okay?』</p>
<p> As for the name, I didn’t want it to be a completely different name, but I’m still the Master that Fran gave me...  A human sword is not good though!  Anyway, when I checked my status, it certainly had changed. My name had changed from Master to Master, the human sword. In addition, the name of the skill and wizard that I’ve been watching for a long time since I came to this world had changed.  The name was just big, but the performance was on a different level. Obviously, the abilities of my skills had been greatly improved.  I’m sure the power of magic and the effects of my skills would increase even more than before. Moreover, that was not the only benefit of inheriting the power of the bearer of hope.  </p>
<p>「Master, great magic power」</p>
<p>「Woof」</p>
<p>  To my surprise, my magic power increased by 5,000, and my magic conductivity increased to SS. In other words, I could put more magic power on my blade and increase my attack power. I would use Evil Crusher, Golden Form, Magic Control, Evil Storm, and all my skills to strengthen myself and pass on my magic power to Fran and Urushi. </p>
<p>《Some of the excess magic power will be transferred to the individual named Fran and the individual named Urushi》</p>
<p>『Fran, Urushi.  Are you okay? Don’t push yourself too hard.』</p>
<p>「Nn!  Don’t worry!  I’ll make full use of it!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  Just as she said, Fran would manipulate the magic power she had provided to her. If Fran now unleashes the Heaven Judgement from the Black Lightning Roll, I was sure that she could unleash the strongest blow in her history. However, there was someone who could move before Fran, who was still building up her power.  Ron.  </p>
<p>「Sophie」</p>
<p>「Surely, my oratorium has weak attack power. But it’s not like I can’t fight it」</p>
<p>  Ron.  It was a quiet sound.  But it was filled with a huge amount of Divine Power.  For some reason, it made me tremble.  Was I impressed by just one sound? Or was it fear?  The saintess stood beside us in shock, surrounded by a large number of instruments.  She put her fingers on the small harp in her hand and lightly clawed it. As if to respond to it, the instruments began to play a sound.  They started with the key, then followed by wooden tubes, brass tubes, and percussion instruments.  The number of sounds increased one after another. The song, which was slow at first, gradually increased in speed and turned into a song so intense that it looked like hard rock or metal.  But it didn’t end there. The ever-increasing uptempo song turned into a song that made the listener feel uneasy, and finally, it was transformed into a song that could not be played so fast.  The magic power released without a pause turned into a wave that enveloped the battlefield and shone brightly. However, the sound suddenly cut off.  I wondered what was going on, but it seemed to be something like a prelude to what used to be. </p>
<p>「Don’t let your wind get away.  Get out of your way, don’t lose.」</p>
<p>「Either way, an end was approaching.」</p>
<p>  Sophie’s words were sinister, even though they were mysterious. The combination of the high-pitched hymn of an instrument and the high-pitched voice of Sophie’s song was like an opera, created a music that would make people’s minds happy, or rather, make them feel somewhat uneasy. </p>
<p>「Everyone lament, sorrow, fear, and destruction.」</p>
<p>  The song of an adventurer that I had heard before was a song of energy that could be used to move forward toward the future.  But like the lyrics, it must be a song of destruction. There was a sound of hope and a sound of despair in the music.  </p>
<p>《Instability of the individual named giant antidemons detected.  The internal magic has decreased.》</p>
<p>  The effect seemed to be completely different. If the adventurer’s song was the top buff to strengthen one’s comrades, then the song of destruction must have some kind of debuffing effect that weakened enemy power.  Sophie’s voice was transformed into a blueish-black light and struck by the giant antidemons over and over again.  I could feel the magic power of the giant antidemons diminishing with each impact.  Moreover, was the surface of their bodies being gradually being whittled down? The antidemons’ bodies were beginning to crumble as if they were starting to fade.  </p>
<p>「Come now, destroy me!  I will do as you specified!」</p>
<p> Sophie’s song had an effect on them, and the presence of the giant antidemons was clearly less than before. However, there were also those who were just as weak as Sophie.  </p>
<p>「My madness is like a curse!」</p>
<p>  Blood tears flowed from both of Sophie’s eyes as she exclaimed. Her face was still pale, and her lips were covered in blood.  The recoil from the song of destruction must have been enough to dull Sophie’s vitality, but Sophie did not stop singing. But Sophie did not stop singing.  She continued her oratory performance with a shout from the King’s position.  Her claws had snapped and peeled, and her blood was pouring into the harp’s strings in a bright red. Finally, the song of destruction ended.  </p>
<p>「Just as the end was approaching, annihilating me fast!」</p>
<p>The recoil from the song of destruction must have been chipping away at Sophie’s vitality. But Sophie did not stop singing. She continued her oratorium performance with a high voice as if she was in her last breath. Her claws had been broken and peeled, and her blood was pouring down on the harp’s strings in a bright red. Finally, the song of destruction ended. </p>
<p>「Just as the end was approaching, annihilating me fast!」</p>
<p> Just as she coughed up her last words, Sophie fell to the ground, bleeding from her mouth and eyes.</p>
