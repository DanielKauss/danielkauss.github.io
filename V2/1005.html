</div><h1>Chapter 1005</h1><p>Meritte smiled when she saw Fran holding me up. But it was not like she made fun of me, but rather a somewhat melancholy smile. I felt the urge to fight, but there was no sign of attacking us. </p>
<p>「Miss Hilt of the Black Cats. If you want to run, I’ll not chase you, okay?」</p>
<p>「Hmm? I won’t run away」</p>
<p>「This continent will turn into hell after this. No, I’ll turn into hell. Maybe I can still escape the continent with my friends now, you know?」</p>
<p> Maybe we can still escape from the continent with our friends now, okay?」</p>
<p>「...... Nonsense.」</p>
<p>  Fran exclaimed, staring into the eyes of the other party.  She must have understood her resolve to remain holed up in those words. Meritte let out a light sigh.  </p>
<p>「I see. Can I ask you one thing?」</p>
<p>「What?」</p>
<p>「Why are you helping the dragonkin?  For the black cats, illegal slavers are your mortal enemies, right?  The source of it all, Georg, is the Dragon King. In other words, the Dragonmen are not your enemies?」</p>
<p>「! I knew it, Georg was the guardian of the illegal slavers?」</p>
<p>「That’s right.  The largest black market slavers organization with distribution all over the world. The leader of them was Dragon King Georg.」</p>
<p> It was said that Georg had taken over an organization that had existed for a long time by force and let his men run it.  Dragonkin tended to avoid slaves and the like, but Georg didn’t show any signs of doing so. He took great pride in his fact that he was special, and so he dared to ignore the common sense of ordinary dragonkin. If he dared, he probably meant something like, </p>
<p>「You’re fucking amazing because you use slaves instead of the other dragonkin.」</p>
<p>「You’ve always believed in the delusion that you’re the new Dragon King approved by the Gods.  Even though he was just a fake! So ridiculous!」</p>
<p>「A fake?  The golden-scaled dragonkin are proof of the royal family, huh?  What does it mean to call them a fake?  </p>
<p>「It can be seen in the detestable Trismegistus.  The royal dragonkin’s magic power is all attributes that have all the basic attributes.  However, it does not contain evil energy.  But Georg was different.  He has two attributes, fire and evil energy. That’s all he said」</p>
<p>「But Georg and his scales were gold」</p>
<p>「That’s a freak.  Evil energy is the power that distorts reason. He just used his innate evil energy to make his scales look golden.」</p>
<p>  This seemed to be an open secret among the dragonkin elders in the northern settlement. A rare two-attributed child suddenly got golden scales one day.  They knew that he was not a royal dragonkin, but they might be able to increase the influence of the northern settlement by using him. That’s why the elders decided to raise Georg and treated him as the Dragon King.Eventually, Georg started to misconstrue himself as the new Dragon King and went out of control.  Not only did he infuse the other dragonkin with his thoughts of freedom and send illegal slavers under his command, but he also believed in the Evil God and sacrificed himself to gain his power.  The Dragon Domination skill that Georg possessed was given to him by the Evil Gods. And Georg was trying to gain even more power by secretly setting up evil crystals in each town and making a huge number of sacrifices.  </p>
<p>「Even though they are punished by the Gods, they do not show any remorse.  A dragonkin is not worth his existence. It is in the best interest of this world to make them disappear.」</p>
<p>「Some dragonkin are good or bad.」</p>
<p>「Hmm? You could say that against your natural enemy, the blue cats?」</p>
<p>「Nn.  There are also good blue cats.  It’s not bad because they’re blue cats.」</p>
<p>  Fran’s continued to say that thanks to Zefmate.  Even Fran, who had been enemies with the entire blue cat race back when we first met, had met a lot of them. She had also encountered a lot of ordinary blue cats in her Beastman Country and elsewhere.  Thanks to this, Fran’s value had changed drastically. I don’t know if it could be called growth, but it seemed to be a great leap forward for me.  </p>
<p>「You have blue cats friends with you」</p>
<p>「... Hmph」</p>
<p> When he saw Fran like that, Merritte sighed in disgust.  </p>
<p>「Dragonkin are worthless scumbags.  They’re savage and inferior lizards who can only hurt others.  The scumbags who live by forcing their problems on others. Because of their neglect, my family is dead!」</p>
<p>  Meritte shouted and looked at Fran in a daze.  He was excited, calm, and unusually excited. His appearance made him look very dangerous. </p>
<p>「Did you know anything about the Evil Dragonmen?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Many Evil Dragonmen are killed by their fellow Dragonmen, but some of them are not.  They saw an opening and escaped, or were secretly escaped, or have escaped from this continent. These evil dragonkin were destined to go completely berserk.  That’s why they take their lives away with their friends.  However, it seems that some of them can escape successfully for various reasons.  However, there is no way an evil dragonkin could truly live outside the continent. They were always repelled and radiated evil energy in various countries.  In the end, many of them were members of criminal organizations or bandits and became criminals.  However, Merritte’s family was attacked by such dragonkin bandits and lost their lives. For her, a dragonkin was like an absolute evil.  </p>
<p>「Dragonkin is not something that a world needs to be built on.」</p>
<p>「But that’s not all.  It’s not the fault of every dragonkin.」</p>
<p>「Little girl......」</p>
<p>Looking at her initial attitude, she must have felt sympathy for Fran, a black cat.  However, Fran and Meritte were different.  When she realized this, her hatred seemed to have been agitated. When they looked at Fran, I could see that hostility was starting to dwell in her eyes. But Fran felt the same way.  </p>
<p>「I know that Georg was a bad guy. But since when have you been manipulating Georg?」</p>
<p>  Certainly, Georg was not a good person. He was the leader of the slavers, and worthy of Fran’s hatred.  But was everything Georg did?  How could he manipulate more antidemons while he was under his control? I think it would be difficult. If so, who was he who drew the picture of the most recent incident? Merritte laughs, perhaps sensing the unexpected questions in Fran’s gaze.  </p>
<p>「Ahahahaha!  You must be so reckless! You’re not going to let me take over everything you’ve prepared for the dragonkin’s independence and die!」</p>
<p>  Mertritte laughs as he tells us the whole story.  Certainly, it was Georg who had prepared the evil crystals. He apparently intended to attack the town with dragonkin and mercenaries and kill the residents as a sacrifice. But before he could carry out his plan, Meritte had him under his control.But before he could carry out his plan, Meritte had full control over him.  </p>
<p>「As you can see, I took care of the finishing touch.」</p>
<p>「...... That giant-type?」</p>
<p>「Yes, that’s right.」</p>
<p>But as he shouted so, there was a clear hint of madness in his eyes.</p>
