</div><h1>Chapter 914</h1><p>「Velmeria is on the right, Lind is on the left」</p>
<p>「Leave it to me!」</p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>Fran and the others split up and attacked the cannon-type. After a closer look, they looked like a turtle shell with spider-like legs.</p>
<p>This was not the same as the usual cannon-type, but there were unfamiliar parts on the edges of its shell.</p>
<p>It was a long tentacle, the tip of which expanded like a weight. There were eight of them, four on the left and four on the right. Magic bullets were released from the tentacles as Fran approached them.</p>
<p>They must be interceptor-like beings that protect the surroundings of the giant body that easily makes blind spots.</p>
<p>Fran slashed at the huge body while dodging its attack. It was a slash strengthened by speed and magic power, but not enough to defeat it with one blow. As I could imagine from its huge body, it had a very high defense and vitality.</p>
<p>「Brilliant Lightning Rush! Haaah!」</p>
<p>『Fire!』</p>
<p>Fran clad in black lightning and thrust me at the wound on the cannon-type. The black lightning and the flames I fired went on a rampage inside the cannon-type’s body.</p>
<p>「Gyieeeee!」</p>
<p>As one would expect from a giant antidemon, it didn’t last long before this attack. Its entire body billowed smoke from it, and its huge body collapsed.</p>
<p>I had been on guard for a few moments, but I saw the cannon-type beginning to turn into dust.</p>
<p>『All right, next!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Fran killed up to five of them in the same way. But that was enough. The enemy started firing faster than I thought. Velmeria and Lind couldn’t cut through the numbers either, allowing them to start firing.</p>
<p>「「「「Gyuoourgh!」」」」</p>
<p>Using a high-pitched roar, similar to a scream, as a trigger, a flash was emitted from the turret on her back. It was a mass of magic power nearly ten meters in diameter.</p>
<p>The amount of magic power contained in it was extraordinary.</p>
<p>The cannon-type launched an unusually powerful projectile, but they also showed signs of unusual behavior. Just as I was thinking about it, it collapsed and turned itself into dust.</p>
<p>It seems they were disposable antidemons that dealt with a deadlock. This was possible only because antidemons don’t have a concept of “indeed” and prefer to maintain their group.</p>
<p>It was a blow from a powerful antidemon that even sacrificed its own life. There was no way that it could be weak.</p>
<p>Twenty magic bullets, each with their own vicious magical power that even made them tremble, flew off in a parabola of a high mountain range. The distance between them was estimated to be 7,80 meters, but the trajectory of the magic bullets seemed to be accurate.</p>
<p>We and Mea quickly shot down half of it with magic, but ten shots rained down on the city walls.</p>
<p>Boooom!!</p>
<p>A flash of magic power was released all at once, covering the entire city wall. After the intense light and the smoke cleared, the ruined city wall was exposed.</p>
<p>The wall of the city had been destroyed over nearly 300 meters. A portion of it was managed to stand like an unbreakable core of an Ringo.</p>
<p>However, they would easily collapse if they were hit a little. The meaning of the city wall was no longer there.</p>
<p>Moreover, the aftermath of the magic bullet blast blew away the buildings around the walls. The huge space created in an instant made it difficult to defend and easy to attack. It was a crisis not only for us but also for Sendia as a whole.</p>
<p>「You got me.」</p>
<p>Fran growled in frustration. Near her, I heard Velmeria mutter in dismay.</p>
<p>「Fre, Derick...」</p>
<p>Yeah, her servant, Frederick, was standing on the wall!</p>
<p>The place where Frederick stood to command the dragonkin had been completely destroyed and turned into a pile of rubble.</p>
<p>If that barrage of bullets hit us, even Frederick would――?</p>
<p>No, it was okay. I could see a dragonkin man standing up after pushing the rubble out of his body. Some of them seemed to have still survived by using Life Detection.</p>
<p>We might be able to save them. Maybe we can save them if we go now.</p>
<p>But we couldn’t leave here.</p>
<p>『Fran! The antidemons have changed our strategy!』</p>
<p>It seems the antidemons are starting to let the swarm loose.</p>
<p>Until now, they must have been in a formation that broke through one point. However, with the collapse of the city wall, they shifted their strategy toward the town.</p>
<p>Once it was widespread, it would be difficult to prevent it with a small number of people. In fact, it would be impossible to completely prevent the invasion of antidemons anymore.</p>
<p>Fran seemed to understand that as well. She muttered a word with a stern expression on her face.</p>
<p>「Let’s reduce it as much as possible」</p>
<p>『Okay. I’ll leave it to you.』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Fran nodded as she readied me and jumped out. It was not the time to save me or continue the battle. I had to do something about it right now.</p>
<p>「Brilliant Lightning Rush! Haaaah!」</p>
<p>We’re targeting high-ranking antidemons, who should be able to be handled by any of the town’s soldiers and adventurers. Then we should defeat those antidemons with the strength of their own.</p>
<p>Ten minutes have passed since we started fighting.</p>
<p>His sense of time was messed up because he was constantly increasing his speed with space-time magic. He was also wearing himself out, and even making me think that he was fighting for hours.</p>
<p>Still, Fran continued to fight in her top gear.</p>
<p>「Uryaaah!」</p>
<p>「Grrr!」</p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>Fran, clad in black lightning, roared and slashed at the red wolf-shaped antidemons. At the same time, she got hit by the black wolf-type ranged attacks that surrounded her.</p>
<p>We used a superior species as bait. We succeeded in blocking it with a barrier, but it managed to considerably reduce our magic power.</p>
<p>Fran, who was serious, did not suffer any decent damage. However, it was difficult to do anything about the exhaustion of her magic power.</p>
<p>The antidemons, perhaps realizing that we were fighting with a smaller amount of mana, had switched to strategies that required as much mana as possible.</p>
<p>But she couldn’t ask for help from her friends.</p>
<p>Mea and Zelos Reed had already used their strongest move to end this battle.</p>
<p>「Golden fire, white fire! Devourer, devour your enemies!」</p>
<p>platinum flames began to overflow from Mea’s entire body. The huge platinum flames, enough to obscure the girl’s figure, then turned into a muddy stream and swallowed the surrounding antidemons.</p>
<p>「I’m not done yet!」</p>
<p>The swirling flames grew in intensity, as if looking for prey. The swirling flames, nearly 50 meters in diameter, turned more than a thousand antidemons into ashes in the slightest.</p>
<p>I guess that was Mea’s strongest move. She was certainly amazing.</p>
<p>But for an attack like this, there should have been a price to pay.</p>
<p>「Kuh......!」</p>
<p>I heard Mea’s almost crushing scream. What the hell just happened?</p>
<p>The answer to my question came when the flames had faded. To my surprise, Mea’s arm had appeared out of the fire and turned reddish-black.</p>
<p>It was a terrible burn. Just as Black Heavenly Tigers had Lightning Nullification, Mea, the Golden Flame Goddess, should have Flame Nullification skill. She would not be affected by her own flames.</p>
<p>Still, the fact that she got burned meant that Mea’s platinum flames even exceeded her flame nullification skills. In other words, she was plunged into the realm of divine flames.</p>
<p>The reason why the regeneration of burns was clearly slow was probably because it contained a slight divine attribute. If we miscontrolled that flame, it would self-destruct in no time.</p>
<p>That’s how dangerous her power was, and despite being wounded herself, Mea’s fighting spirit was even greater.</p>
<p>She glared at the antidemons with radiant eyes as she defeated the ones who tried to climb over the wall. A lion clad in flames would use its body as a shield to protect Sendia.</p>
<p>Lind was fighting antidemons at a distance from Mea. Even as a fire dragon, Lind would probably be damaged by Mea’s platinum flames.</p>
<p>Using that huge body as a wall, it interfered with the antidemons to slightly reduce their invasion.</p>
<p>Zefmate and Frederick were the same. They put up their bodies to hold back the antidemons, healing wounds of all sizes with potions.</p>
<p>Velmeria and Frederick had created a wall of water over 100 meters long, and they were trying to manage to block our invasion of the antidemon town. Hundreds of antidemons had been slaughtered, as it seemed to have the ability to automatically counterattack antidemons that touched the wall.</p>
<p>While maintaining that level of water magic, she even went on the offensive. She held a dagger created from water in her hands and was dancing among the antidemons. Every time Velmeria turned around, the antidemons jumped at her.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I saw a surge of magic power in Velmeria’s head. No, it wasn’t so much her head, but her mouth?</p>
<p>As I was surprised, Velmeria emitted a white flash of light from her mouth.</p>
<p>「Uraaaaaaaah!」</p>
<p>(Amazing. Just like a dragon)</p>
<p>The flow of magic was very similar to the dragonkin’s breath attacks we had seen before. I never thought I would be able to do something like this.</p>
<p>Velmeria’s breath, released sideways, engulfed more than a thousand antidemons in one shot. But I couldn’t help but be impressed. I could feel the magic in Velmeria’s body diminishing rapidly.</p>
<p>Even though it inherited some of the power of the Divine Dragon Form, it must be quite difficult for her.</p>
<p>It was the same with everyone else.</p>
<p>『This is bad...!』</p>
<p>But now, thanks to everyone’s wide-area attacks without thinking about what to do next, they were miraculously unable to break through it.</p>
<p>However, when someone ran out of magic power, it would start a imbalance. She seemed to be able to hear the footsteps of the tragedy up close.</p>
