</div><h1>Chapter 962</h1><p>In coordination with the adventurers, we succeeded in destroying the antidemons swarming around Brutori.</p>
<p>But there was still a big one left. He called out to Fran, who landed next to Isario, who had removed the flames.</p>
<p>「We should assume that as long as that big monster remains, antidemons will start gushing out.」</p>
<p>「Nn. What should we do about that?」</p>
<p>「Will you do it now?」</p>
<p>「Are you sure?」</p>
<p>Isario shrugged lightly, showing the motivation gushing out of Fran’s eyes.</p>
<p>「Well, I won’t complain if Uncle is happy. Besides, he’s quite close to the town. Besides, you want to go, right?」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「Then please do your best」</p>
<p>Twice a day, the Divine Sword Release would be quite risky for Isario. It would be not only a reduction in level, but also a significant backlash.</p>
<p>Besides, Isario was right, we were too close to the town. It must be a little troublesome for Isario to control it so as not to cause any damage.</p>
<p>It would be fine as long as Fran could defeat it. It wouldn’t work, but if she had inflicted damage, Isario might be able to put a stop to it without using the Divine Sword Release.</p>
<p>At the very least, I decided that there was nothing bad that could be left to Fran.</p>
<p>(Master, let’s do this!)</p>
<p>『Yeah, we can’t just rely on Isario for everything we’ve got』</p>
<p>(Nn! If I had used the Divine Sword many times, I’m sure it would be dangerous for Isario)</p>
<p>Fran knew that Isario was not at full power. She was hiding it well, but the backlash was definitely there.</p>
<p>It was hard for us to say that the exhaustion from the fierce battles we’ve fought on this continent had healed. But it was probably much better than Isario’s now. We’ve recovered quite a bit while Fran was asleep.</p>
<p>『Weak attacks may be blocked by that amniotism. It also contains a lot of magic power after all. So, let’s build up and unleash our all-out attack』</p>
<p>「Nn. Okay」</p>
<p>Fran nodded with a look of determination and carried me on her shoulder. Then, she glanced back at me.</p>
<p>The adventurers and Isario stood in line to watch over Fran. But they were not the only ones that Fran was concerned about.</p>
<p>『Fran, what’s wrong?』</p>
<p>(A lot, dead.)</p>
<p>『Yeah』</p>
<p>(So, so...... Hmm?)</p>
<p>Fran was probably watching the adventurers sleeping at the gate and beyond. The adventurers would never get up again.</p>
<p>In the past, Fran’s only thoughts about many other adventurers would have been that of a peer. She probably didn’t have a strong feeling about them as a friend of her.</p>
<p>However, as a result of fighting, singing, and enjoying the party with the adventurers, they seemed to have developed a sense of camaraderie towards the adventurers.</p>
<p>And it seemed that the deaths of so many adventurers caused Fran to have strange feelings for them. Fran herself didn’t seem to understand why she felt that way.</p>
<p>I couldn’t put my feelings into words, and I tilted my head. But I guess I wasn’t in a bad mood. After staring at the giant antidemon again, I seemed to have regained my spirits.</p>
<p>(...I’ll protect this town for sure!)</p>
<p>『Yeah, you’re right』</p>
<p>I was born several decades ago, it seems. Not that it means much to me considering how I don’t remember living that long myself.</p>
<p>As she walked toward the giant antidemons, Fran slowly kneaded the magic power.</p>
<p>I don’t mean to say that we have much time, but we are not so worried that ruin might occur in a few minutes.</p>
<p>I had enough composure to slowly build up my strength and prepare for a serious blow.</p>
<p>Just like Fran, I focused my magic power on it.</p>
<p>The antidemons springed up around Fran, who was walking slowly. However, the flames launched from the rear quickly killed the antidemons immediately after they appeared.</p>
<p>That’s the strongest reinforcement we’ve ever received. No one would be able to put up such a reassuring rearguard.</p>
<p>「Phew......... Haaah......」</p>
<p>Fran continued to walk at the same distance without disrupting the antidemon’s presence. Her breathing became deeper and deeper, and with each breath, magic power within her increased at an alarming rate.</p>
<p>And yet, there were no fragments of magic power leaking out of it. This was a sign that it was able to completely concentrate its magic power without wasting any magic power.</p>
<p>When the distance between us and the giant antidemons was about 100 meters, I teleported Fran. I had hoped Fran would do so.</p>
<p>Fran began to fall as soon as she teleported.</p>
<p>They were looking at the giant antidemons directly below with sharp eyes behind the orange sun, which had begun to lower its altitude just a little.</p>
<p>「Awakening, Brilliant Lightning Rush... Urushi!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「You’re still tired?」</p>
<p>「Grrrr!」</p>
<p>「Then lend me your strength」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Urushi was fatigued all over his body, but he seemed to have recovered to the point where he could swing his paw. Fran and Urushi jumped up in the air and timed themselves with Aun’s breathing.</p>
<p>「Woooof!」</p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>Fran was struck down by Urushi’s paw. It was a wolf-type swordsmanship.</p>
<p>Fran was accelerating from the cold air of the sky toward the giant antidemons. For a moment, my blade was covered in black lightning.</p>
<p>It was black lightning, imbued with a faint Divine Power. It wasn’t just that it was given to me. I could feel the converged black lightning mixed with my magic power to increase my offensive power.</p>
<p>「Black Lightning God’s Claw!」</p>
<p>This is one of the most difficult techniques using black lightning.</p>
<p>It was probably one of the most powerful attacks that Fran was able to unleash, combining Wolf-Style Sword Drawing Technique with her Black Lightning God’s Claw. If it succeeded, that was.</p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>With a sharp exhalation, they unleashed a slash――a giant antidemon that slashed in two at the same time.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>At the same time, an enormous amount of black lightning released ignited his entire body. The tremendous heat released instantly evaporated the amniot from the surrounding giant antidemons. The white mist then drifted around us.</p>
<p>Is it safe to inhale this? Let’s just cover the surroundings with a wind barrier for now.</p>
<p>The impact of the black lightning knocked the body of a giant antidemon in half, collapsing from side to side.</p>
<p>Fran landed a little farther away from me by teleporting, falling to one knee and moaning in frustration.</p>
<p>「......!」</p>
<p>The giant antidemons still had a small amount of mana in their mouths. I could see the cut section slowly rising.</p>
<p>Not even one of our strongest blows would have been able to defeat that giant antidemon. No, maybe we could have defeated it if it was as powerful as we had expected.</p>
<p>However, at the moment it was launched, the control of the Black Lightning God’s Claw became a little sweeter, and the power of the slash became weaker. It had worn out a lot of giant antidemons, but it was still trying to regenerate.</p>
<p>But neither Fran nor I felt sorry for him, but we were not worried about him.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>In front of us, we saw countless flames raining down on the giant antidemons. Although we did not manage to achieve our goal of defeating him, we had completed our minimum mission of reducing Isario’s burden.</p>
<p>There was no sign of the divine sword. The antidemons must have decided that they could no longer be released. As a result, the red flames burned all the giant antidemons that had been cut open and turned into ashes.</p>
