</div><h1>Chapter 1088</h1><p>The reward for accomplishing the mission. It was to return to the reincarnation cycle of Earth with a little preferential treatment. The main idea was that she would be assured of her next life full of talent and fortune.</p>
<p>And now I was gone.</p>
<p>Surprisingly no fear when it comes to that. Is it because she’s going to die? Or is it because the Gods are doing something to prevent her from becoming scared?</p>
<p>But what was important to me was not myself.</p>
<p>『If I go back to the reincarnation cycle, what will happen to the sword now?』</p>
<p>「My kin will take over the rest. The Heavenly Wolf Sword, Fenrir. That will be my new name」</p>
<p>『Eh? Fenrir-san, you were able to revive it, weren’t you?』</p>
<p>「It is not a complete resurrection after the separation from the Evil God’s soul is over. It will still be necessary to accumulate power for a while. However, now that the soul has been separated, it is possible to protect both Fenrir and the being called the Evil God separately. The rest is in our territory」</p>
<p>『But still, you’re trapped inside that sword?』</p>
<p>「It’s not a long time for a God’s kindred to witness a wielder’s life」</p>
<p>Now that the Evil God Fragment and Fenrir’s soul were separated, I, the filter to prevent Evil Spirits, were no longer necessary.</p>
<p>『...The name of the sword is Heavenly Wolf. Could it be a Divine Sword?』</p>
<p>「Yes, that’s right.」</p>
<p>A Divine Sword, huh...? I’m sure it was strong. It was far stronger than me.</p>
<p>In order to lift the curse placed on her by the Black Cat kin, Fran would be put into an even more fierce battle in the future. The Divine Sword must be of great help to her.</p>
<p>He may be able to fight with the pieces of the Evil Gods on his own. If he wanted to make Fran’s long-cherished dream come true, it might be more foolproof to leave it to Fenrir-san.</p>
<p>But still――.</p>
<p>『You have to go back to the reincarnation cycle, huh?』</p>
<p>「What do you mean?」</p>
<p>『So I have to get back to Earth, huh?』</p>
<p>「Forget everything, and be reincarnated on Earth. That is what dissatisfaction is? I promise you a life that you won’t be troubled by in the next life」</p>
<p>The Goddess of the Silver Moon was bewildered. Apparently, for the Gods, a preferential afterlife is a rather tempting reward.</p>
<p>Well, I thought it would be an attractive reward for me right after I died on Earth. But that was not the case for me right now.</p>
<p>The Goddess of Chaos seemed to know how I feel. She smirked. I wonder if the Goddess of the Underworld understands that too?</p>
<p>Maybe it was the difference between whether or not this area had much contact with people. The Goddess of the Silver Moon didn’t understand human feelings, or rather, she tried to understand them, but she didn’t seem to fully understand them. Even so, she was probably much better than the other merciless Gods.</p>
<p>『I’m Fran’s Master and my partner. I can’t just abandon Fran and be reincarnated by myself. I wonder if I can somehow stay in this world?』</p>
<p>「Ara? But this is your chance to get a Divine Sword, right? What do you think Fran think about it?」</p>
<p>The Goddess of Chaos asked me in a teary tone. But I had already decided on the answer.</p>
<p>『I’m sure you’ll be happy. Even if you get a Divine Sword, if it’s not me, Fran will be sad』</p>
<p>「Ufufu. Yeah, you might be right. But if I heard that you would be reincarnated as happy, I’m sure she’ll be happy to send me off, right?」</p>
<p>『Maybe so, but that’s not the case. I――I wanted to be next to Fran and stay in this world. So, I’m not rejecting it because I want to forget everything and be happy by myself. But rather than being happy in the next life, being with Fran now is happier for me! So, I’ll stay in this world!』</p>
<p>I’m Fran’s partner. I’ll watch over her whereabouts and live with her. Everything else is just a trifling matter.</p>
<p>「I know how much you want to stay here. But what about Fenrir? Those days when he’s been trapped in you as your second personality?」</p>
<p>『Muh... That is...』</p>
<p>To be honest, I didn’t think about that. I guess what I mean by “remaining” was that Fenrir-san was going to sleep again...</p>
<p>『Umm, why don’t you ask them to put me in a different vessel or something? If you can stay here, it doesn’t matter what kind of small fry weapon you have!』</p>
<p>「O God! I’m counting on you too!」</p>
<p>『Eh? Fenrir-san?』</p>
<p>Even Fenrir-san began to bow his head to the Gods.</p>
<p>「Master and Fran are no longer strangers to me. I’m not at ease sleeping in the sword again. So, could you please help me stay in this world?」</p>
<p>『But then, Fenrir-san...』</p>
<p>「Anyway, I won’t be able to get out of the sword until I’m resurrected anyway. So, it will be different for me to sleep for a while. Besides, Master and Fran are no longer strangers to me. Your wishes are mine. So, God, please...!」</p>
<p>『O-Okay, please!』</p>
<p>Fenrir and the two bowed their heads. Then the Goddess of the Underworld opened their mouths, looking like she was suspicious.</p>
<p>「If you refuse here, you will never be able to return to the reincarnation of Earth. Is that all right?」</p>
<p>『As long as you stay near Fran, that’s all that matters』</p>
<p>「This reward is only the power of reincarnation. I can’t convert it into another power and give it to you. You’ll be completely unrewarded, is it okay?」</p>
<p>『Yes. Fran, Urushi, and Fenrir-san have Announcer-san. Meeting new friends is like a reward for me after all』</p>
<p>「......I see. I will allow you to remain here.」</p>
<p>「Me too. I still have a ways to go.」</p>
<p>「......My kin, are you sure?」</p>
<p>「Yes!」</p>
<p>「Understood. Then, I will cancel the execution of the reward and maintain the current situation」</p>
<p>「Yeah, but you have to mess with the system a little. At this rate, Master’s growth will stop here. I’ll continue to absorb magic stones and change the system so that Master can become stronger」</p>
<p>『T-Thank you very much! Can you go that far?』</p>
<p>「Yeah! Because that makes it more interesting!」</p>
<p>『Yeah, sure...』</p>
<p>But I was really grateful. I guess we can still help Fran with this.</p>
<p>「My kin, I’ll see you again one day」</p>
<p>「Bye bye」</p>
<p>「Ufufu. I’ll have a good chaos in the future...」</p>
