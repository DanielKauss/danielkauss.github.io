</div><h1>Chapter 983</h1><p>After defeating Resalva, we went around defeating the other dragonkin who had lost control, but something else had happened again on the battlefield. </p>
<p>『Fran! The antidemons! Moreover, we’re getting sick of the dragonkin together!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p> We saw the presences of dragonkin and antidemons mixed in the same troop. Like I thought, they were able to control the antidemons! But that’s not it. The ones who showed up were neither antidemons nor dragonkin. No, it’s more correct to say that they were either of them. No, it’s more correct to say that they were either of them.  They looked basically dragonkin, but a part of their body had been turned into antidemons. What was more, the magic contained in them was an order of magnitude greater than that of a giant dragonkin.  They had a threat level of B. There were more than twenty such antidemon dragonkin that could be called antidemon dragonkin, and they rushed toward us from the direction of Trismegistus’ castle.  The ten running in front of us were evenly formed, and their silhouettes would be similar to that of a human.The ten antidemons in front of us were evenly formed, and their silhouettes would be similar to that of a human.  The ball-shaped beings that rolled behind them were also like antidemon dragonkin.  The quality of the magic power they emitted was the same for both of them.  Maybe their body shape would change depending on their abilities and skills.  I guess they also have the properties of antidemons.  </p>
<p>「Isario-dono!」</p>
<p>「I know!  Shiki-san! The antidemon dragonkin were much stronger than the dragonkin, who had lost their reason for rampaging around the battlefield.  Isario must have thought it dangerous for him and his squad to deal with them. They then began to move toward the antidemon dragonkin, accompanied by a portion of the dragonkin.  This time, we should launch a long-range attack too. That was because we didn’t launch a long-range attack earlier because we were afraid that everyone other than Isario would hate us.  However, because we were now in a disorderly brawl, not many people would be able to unleash magic against our new enemy. Even if only Fran and I worked hard, we were far from barrage.  In the end, we allowed the antidemon dragonkin to approach the convoy without being able to inflict any damage. No wait, they were still more than 300 meters away, but they should have been in the barrage. To our surprise, the humanoid antidemon dragonkin lifted his sphere-shaped friends above his head and threw them at us.  What a powerful force!  </p>
<p>「Are you aiming at Uncle and the Militant Nation of Hagane!?  Don’t you hate them!」</p>
<p>  The magic power overflowing from within and his body that began to tear slightly after being unable to withstand the pressure. Half of the sphere-shaped antidemon dragonkin who were believed to be capable of a suicide attack were thrown at Isario, and the other half was toward the carriage of the Militant Nation of Hagane.  There was no doubt that the enemy’s aim was the Divine Sword.  </p>
<p>『Fran, take care of that guy! I’ll help Isario!』</p>
<p>「Okay!」</p>
<p>『Urushi! Try to block the humanoid from getting a little closer!』</p>
<p>「Grr!」</p>
<p>  The magic power of that ball-type antidemon dragonkin was so vicious that it gave him chills.  A single shot would be enough to hold several extreme spells.  Five of them at a time.  No matter how much Isario tries, he won’t be able to completely offset it without using the Divine Sword. </p>
<p>『It’s impossible to defeat it, but it’s enough to knock it down!』</p>
<p>  I activated Dimensional Magic and Full Power Telekinesis at the same time.  Aside from my telekinesis, Dimensional Magic was not so easy to control while doing other things. But I had no choice but to do it. But I don’t hate a good old dude like that!  </p>
<p>『Turn shield!』</p>
<p>  I couldn’t create a Dimension Gate that would move that huge body.  If that was the case, I would change its trajectory. It’s a technique used to distort the space and divert the trajectory of the flying tool, but if the magic power is greatly suppressed, it will also work on something even bigger.  One of the sphere-type antidemon dragonkin made contact with the turn shield and changed its trajectory drastically. Just like a ball of change thrown by a professional baseball player, it suddenly turned to the right. At the same time, the other one, whose course had been changed by telekinesis, was slipping to the left. The antidemon dragonkin were violently clashing in the air, and the impact was repelled greatly.  The destination of the flying was probably far from the battlefield where the second unit was. There may be a aftermath, but it was better than a direct hit.  I also used wind magic in succession to try to divert its trajectory. However, it was blocked by a barrier and did not work.  Even so, I succeeded in concentrating all my magic into one and shooting it down. I managed to make it fall between the second unit and the humanoid. But I forced too much magic to use it.  </p>
<p>『The limit of continuous activation is...!  There are two more things we should do...!』</p>
<p> While I was in a hurry, Fran was trying to deal with the ball-shaped antidemon dragonkin that flew by Miranleil Hagane’s side.  </p>
<p>「Kanna Kamui!  Tyaaa!」</p>
<p>  Fran, who didn’t have telekinesis or Dimensional Magic, was going to use a straightforward attack. In addition to her Kanna Kamui, she unleashed a series of Sonic Waves. I saw Fran’s arms scream as they were under a high load due to the unreasonable series of attacks.  Her skin was torn open and blood was pouring out of her body.  Her muscles and bones were probably in pain. Even so, Fran did not take a break and continued to attack. Then, she managed to knock down two of them.  However, that was the extent of Fran’s blocking. She exceeded her limit and stopped her movements. The other magicians began to attack in place of Fran, but because of the powerful barrier, weak magic would hardly do much to stop them.  So, would they give up on attacking and put everything into their defense?  At the very least, Songyu and the others could――  </p>
<p>「It’s enough.  Leave the rest to me」</p>
<p>「Mazyuku」</p>
<p> Before I knew it, Maste‍ </p>
<p>『Belserk’s abilities are powerful, but how far can I go?』</p>
<p> Yeah, while glaring at the flying dragonkin, they held Berserk in a praying pose. It was the same as when he attacked a giant-type antidemon.  </p>
<p>「He’s dead.」</p>
<p>  triggered by her mutterings, the ball-shaped antidemon dragonkin’s body quickly withered and his magic power weakened. Due to his shape, it seemed like a ball that really escaped the air.  However, only two of them managed to defeat. They seemed to have tried to use more force, but before they could, the dragonkin had collapsed.  </p>
<p>「Kuh......」</p>
<p>  Seeing this, Isario must have understood that the opponent was stronger than he had imagined. And at last, he had made the decision.  </p>
<p>「Divine Sword Release!」</p>
<p>  The divine sword then exploded with magic power emanating from his body.  </p>
<p>『You let him use it in the end!』</p>
<p>  But that didn’t seem to be a problem for the other side. It would be unlikely that Isario, who had released the Divine Sword, would fail.  Now we just have to do something about one shot from the Militant Nation of Hagane. However, magic shot down from a humanoid.  It seems that they saw our formation and decided that they could do something as long as they could interfere with Fran. I wondered if they were in a reckless state, but their situation was actually quite predictable! Both Fran and I were so busy putting up barriers that we couldn’t afford to unleash our attacks.  </p>
<p>「Moss of snow!」</p>
<p>『Fran!BOOOOOOOMN!</p>
