</div><h1>Chapter 996</h1><p>After Trismegistus fought for about half an hour, the antidemons in the underground space had been completely exterminated.</p>
<p>「Phew.........」</p>
<p>When Trismegistus canceled the Divine Dragon Form, there was not a single antidemon left.</p>
<p>The only trace of the antidemons was the ground wounds caused by the fierce battles.</p>
<p>It was also said that the repairs had already started. This was also a part of the castle and had an auto-repair feature provided by the Gods.</p>
<p>In a few hours, the wounds would be completely gone. Then, tomorrow, they would be in tatters from the battle between Trismegistus and the antidemons again.</p>
<p>Trismegistus meditated his eyes and regenerated his wounds, but he immediately walked away before the wounds were healed. He must have worn himself out unseen, but his steps were as graceful as ever.</p>
<p>I was already used to not looking back at us, but I was surprised that I didn’t feel any damage at all. Was it because of my getting used to it?</p>
<p>Anyway, it seemed like we still didn’t know the depth of that dragonkin.</p>
<p>「We’re coming too.」</p>
<p>Frederick started to move after Trismegistus. He tried to hurry everyone, but he didn’t try to run as fast as he could.</p>
<p>She was walking behind Trismegistus, looking a little irritated.</p>
<p>Apparently, there was more fighting ahead. That was why they couldn’t leave Trismegistus unattended.</p>
<p>The group continued to walk quietly into the dark underground space. Once the light of magic emitted by Trismegistus and the antidemons had disappeared, we were now in a world ruled by darkness.</p>
<p>But it was unusual for everyone here. Fran and the others moved forward without any fear.</p>
<p>After about ten minutes of walking, we finally saw the end of this huge underground passageway. There was a small door on the wall, much larger than it had been in the past.</p>
<p>However, the strange presence emanating from the other side of the door was so strong that it made me wonder if she had been in the vanguard before.</p>
<p>I see. There can be no doubt that the Abyss Eater’s nucleus is up ahead.</p>
<p>Still, there was something on my mind along the way. There was no trace of battle at all, not Trismegistus.</p>
<p>That’s the trail of the Dragon King and his party that should have led the way.</p>
<p>If we were sure we went to the basement, we should be walking through here.</p>
<p>Since it was not instantly repaired, the ground that had been destroyed in the battle should remain intact.</p>
<p>However, there was no trace of his attack.</p>
<p>『Urushi, do you smell Velmeria?』</p>
<p>(Woof!)</p>
<p>『Is that so?』</p>
<p>(Woof!)</p>
<p>They nodded many times in the wind, as if Urushi was convinced. Velmeria’s scent seemed to still be strong here.</p>
<p>There was no doubt that Frederick’s seeker was up ahead.</p>
<p>Then how did they get through it?</p>
<p>「So you’re a high-ranking antidemon user? Did you manage to fool all eyes of that high-ranking antidemon?」</p>
<p>One possible possibility was the ability to hide the entire group. So, it makes sense if we consider that he slipped through without fighting at all.</p>
<p>Fran had an ability similar to the title of “Very Valkyrie”.</p>
<p>The second option was teleportation. We’ll pass through it all at once through a series of teleportation. I don’t think there’s anything we can’t do if we try.</p>
<p>However, this place was filled with the magic power of the Abyss Eater. To be honest, I wouldn’t be able to use teleport properly in this place. After all, it’s impossible to activate it continuously after only a single time.</p>
<p>If their opponent could do that, they would have a considerable advantage in the battle.</p>
<p>Third, the possibility of manipulating antidemons. If we could have perfectly controlled the giants, we would have been able to manipulate the higher tier antidemons here.</p>
<p>Trismegistus muttered the first verse about the lack of antidemons, considering that the Dragon Kings had tried to take them both down?</p>
<p>Both methods have troublesome abilities, and we can’t let our guard down if we’re wrong. While I was thinking about this, Trismegistus pushed the door open.</p>
<p>The air was so warm that it made the bangs of the golden dragonkin shake. I shouldn’t have smelled anything, but I felt a bloody smell coming from them.</p>
<p>The air was really gushing like that.</p>
<p>Right now, I was grateful for Trismegistus’ indifference.</p>
<p>Just like Trismegistus, who was walking through the door with stats, everyone was moving forward. We followed them from the rear.</p>
<p>It was a strange passageway that was both high and narrow. Maybe it was made for dragonkin?</p>
<p>They continued through the rough passageway, which had not even been decorated as usual, in a straight line.</p>
<p>Fran should have been blinded so that Isario and Zelos Reed could not see ahead, but I could feel the tension building up.</p>
<p>We were in a completely battle-ready position.</p>
<p>She must have sensed the killing intent emanating from the other side of the passage.</p>
<p>This wasn’t the Abyss Eater’s appetite-based killing intent. It was more of a direct hit, aimed at our enemies.</p>
<p>『Fran, with the presence of Velmeria.』</p>
<p>(Nn... but it’s weird.)</p>
<p>『Yeah, he might be controlling it.』</p>
<p>There were multiple culprits, one of whom was definitely a blue-haired dragonkin girl.</p>
