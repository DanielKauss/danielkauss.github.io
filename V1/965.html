</div><h1>Chapter 965</h1><p>When we arrived in Sendia, we found many adventurers guarding the walls. They were probably wary of the reappearance of the giant antidemons, or giant-types.</p>
<p>As soon as we entered the town, the walking people gave us a stare. They were not looking at Isario but Fran. There were no negative emotions in their gaze, rather, they were welcome.</p>
<p>I was also called by a few people from time to time, like Saintess-sama’s friends or the Black Cat Princess-san.</p>
<p>Most of them were words of thanks for saving the town and the saintess. Isario was also famous, but it seemed that Fran was more popular in this town now.</p>
<p>「Oi oi, that must be super popular then」</p>
<p>「Really?」</p>
<p>Isario even smirked and teased Fran on the shoulder. But as for Fran, she has seen Isario at the guild and Sophie’s popularity in this town. She had also been welcome by the Black Cat Kin village before.</p>
<p>They probably didn’t think that was why it was so popular.</p>
<p>As we were walking around, I met a familiar face.</p>
<p>I don’t remember his name, but he was just a random thug in the Beastmen Union. He was a rat-type beastman. I’d seen him stay with Mea a few times already.</p>
<p>「Sis! We’re back!」</p>
<p>She smiled happily when she called Fran over to her. The beastmen consider Fran their idol of choice.</p>
<p>「Do you know where Mea, Sophie, and Velmeria are?」</p>
<p>「Yeah! They might think you’re in the hideout right next to them! But Velmeria and Frederick are just like dragonkin girls, right? I’ve never seen one of them lately.」</p>
<p>「Who are those guys from Silard?」</p>
<p>「Those guys shouldn’t be inn, right?」</p>
<p>Apparently, he was still in this town for the time being.</p>
<p>「Can I take you to the Adventurers Guild?」</p>
<p>「Please do.」</p>
<p>「Yeah!」</p>
<p>Fran would have to check Mea and Sophie’s safety or she would not be able to calm down. Isario didn’t seem to be complaining, since it was important to get the cooperation of the most important people in this town.</p>
<p>As we walked, we learned about the time when a giant-type appeared.</p>
<p>Giant-types also appeared next to Sendia, causing a huge commotion throughout the city. We had defeated the horde of antidemons, but we had never heard of them being attacked again.</p>
<p>Besides, the collapsed walls had not been fixed yet, and the reconstruction was not over. It was the worst time for them to be attacked.</p>
<p>Still, the towers, the Beastmen Union, the dragonkin, and the guild worked together to try to counter them. If Saintess, Mea, and Velmeria were there, they would be able to handle this, and they were very willing to fight.</p>
<p>However, an even more unexpected reinforcement appeared on top of that.</p>
<p>And to their surprise, an army attacked the giant-type and its subordinates from behind. These were the knights of Silard.</p>
<p>Their lure almost zero damage to the town, as only a few of them were injured from the tremors.</p>
<p>In the end, the town’s forces raided the antidemons, which were distracted by the holy knights, and succeeded in destroying them.</p>
<p>The holy knight seemed to have been severely injured. The rat guy praised them for reevaluating the holy knights.</p>
<p>「Well, our attacks couldn’t work on the big monsters, but that’s where Mea and Saintess-sama came in. The two of you worked together with the Divine Sword Knights to defeat the big monsters in no time!」</p>
<p>I’m sure they could have defeated Adel on their own, but they would have really killed her instantly with Mea’s help. Still, would the holy knights really want to sacrifice themselves to save Sendia?</p>
<p>The holy knights, who were highly conscious of their chosen people, must have looked down on this illegal city as an enemy. Even if he made it Addle, I don’t think there was a reason for them to help Sendia at the expense of their subordinates.</p>
<p>Silard, as I imagined, would probably push an antidemon opponent to Sendia and kidnap them all.</p>
<p>But at any rate, I could tell that Sophie was safe and the holy knights hadn’t done anything suspicious in town.</p>
<p>As we were talking to the beastmen, we soon arrived at our destination building. The gatekeeper at the entrance also remembered Fran, and he let us pass through without difficulty.</p>
<p>「Oh! It wasn’t you, Fran! You’re back!」</p>
<p>「Wasn’t Mea all right? Like the giant antidemons and Silard?」</p>
<p>「Indeed, we will be fine. The holy knights were quite well done though.」</p>
<p>Sophie must be in a different place, and Mea was the only one who greeted her.</p>
<p>「The man over there is... Isario-dono!」</p>
<p>「Oh, was she the daughter of the Beast King?」</p>
<p>「Do you know him?」</p>
<p>「He only greeted me. Well, it’s just that I know Isario-dono one-sidedly. As someone who uses the same fire as me, I can’t just ignore him!」</p>
<p>There was a hint of genuine respect in Mea’s eyes. Mea was a race and a job that manipulated fire, but she seemed to respect Isario as a superior.</p>
<p>They must have gathered a lot of information, even if only counting the number of times we’ve met them in person.</p>
<p>「Ah, handshake!」</p>
<p>「Yeah, I think we did it a while ago.」</p>
<p>「I’d like you to ask me as many times as you want!」</p>
<p>「I-I don’t mind. Rather than that, I’ve heard that the holy knights of Silard saved this town. Is that true?」</p>
<p>「Aah―, I see...」</p>
<p>Mea told us the truth with a wry smile.</p>
<p>「For us, it’s a good thing they got caught up in it on their own.」</p>
<p>It seems the holy knights were not trying to save Sendia, but a giant-type appeared in front of them.</p>
<p>At first they tried to escape, but they got surrounded by gushing antidemons, which made it impossible for them to escape. The truth was, Sendia took advantage of this.</p>
<p>Mea had heard about the terms of the Holy Nation and the Medical Director’s agreement, but she didn’t think she was gonna attack Sophie right now because of the considerable exhaustion of Ader.</p>
<p>Silard must have said that he wanted to save her for a little gain. It was really annoying even though she was involved.</p>
<p>While we were talking to Mea, a new figure appeared from the back. It was Quina, Mea’s servant.</p>
<p>「Since I just gave you this message, I believe the saintess will be there soon.」</p>
<p>She had ordered one of the beastmen under her command to let Sophie go.</p>
<p>「Take care. Quina!」</p>
<p>「It’s not like the young lady from somewhere standing where she’s talking without tea after all」</p>
<p>「...I-I was just about to serve you! Prepare some tea!」</p>
<p>「I’ve prepared for you at the back, so please go ahead」</p>
<p>「...Fu-fuhaha! My subordinates are very capable, aren’t they?」</p>
<p>She was still the master and servant as usual.</p>
