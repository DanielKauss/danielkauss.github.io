</div><h1>Chapter 960</h1><p>After defeating the giant antidemons, something else happened again before Fran and Urushi could move. Depending on the difference in strength, it swayed on the ground over and over again. Then, I saw the dust flying far away and the huge shadows standing in it. </p>
<p>「The same as here?」</p>
<p>「Probably. I can’t believe that there are only five or six of them feeling the tremor. Besides, the one that looks closest to that」</p>
<p>「Huh?」</p>
<p>「That’s right. I think it’s similar to Brutori」</p>
<p> I think it’s pretty close to Brutori」</p>
<p>  Fran groaned at Isario’s words. It was probably because she didn’t think that Brutori’s power would be enough to defeat the giant antidemons. In fact, it looked like an instant kill because of the aggressiveness of Isario and Ignis, but they were too troublesome to deal with when fighting normally.  </p>
<p>「...What should we do?」</p>
<p>  Normally, Fran would listen to me, but now she was looking up at Isario next to her. I-it’s not like she’s jealous.  It’s not a bad thing that Fran can rely on other adults besides me. It’s just that the ties Fran has with people and the ring she has with people are expanding.  It only made me feel a little sad. But more importantly, I was happy that Fran was able to interact with people.  </p>
<p>「Well, let’s go back.  We can’t just abandon Brutori.」</p>
<p>「Okay.」</p>
<p> Isario, who had been fighting on this continent for many years, knew that he wouldn’t be able to leave many people behind. Fran nodded happily at his words, and I guess she had no choice but to go back here.  </p>
<p>「Okay, let’s hurry a little, okay?」</p>
<p>「Nn!  Urushi, do your best!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  Isario jumped on the moving board and poured in magic power.  Immediately after, he began to accelerate at once at a tremendous speed. He suddenly started to move at high speed from a standstill, looking a little like a toy.  However, his speed was beyond laughable.  Not only did he look like a toy, but he’s probably even faster than an F1 car. He hurriedly called out to Urushi, who was staring at Isario in disbelief.  </p>
<p>『Urushi! Let’s go!』</p>
<p>「W-woof!」</p>
<p>  Urushi was desperately trying to chase after Isario’s board as it slipped on the ground by erupting flames.  Urushi was serious too.  But even so, he could not catch up with Isario easily. After using strengthening magic and continuing to cast healing magic, Urushi finally reached the back of the board while using all his strength.  </p>
<p>「Miss Hilt!  Don’t push yourself too hard, you can come later!」</p>
<p>「Okay!」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>  Urushi was getting stronger, but I’m sure he’s pushing himself pretty hard. Worst case scenario, I thought we’d have to get Isario first, but Urushi worked very hard. Just as I was thinking that, Urushi worked very hard.  He could not stand to lose to the magic tool at the speed of his movement. Even when Fran and I warned him not to do anything rash, he did not slow down. He was so breathing that it made me wonder if he was going to exhale blood, and he desperately swallowed the sour stuff that was pouring in and ran to the end.  He stopped once about 100 meters in front of the Brutori and immediately fell to the ground. His breathing was holding back, and the timing of his chest swings was irregular.  </p>
<p>「Zeez...  Zeez... Goff...」</p>
<p>「... That little lady’s follower is pretty amazing!  I was serious on this, you know? I never thought I’d follow her until the very end!」</p>
<p>「Urushi, did his best」</p>
<p>「Zeha...」</p>
<p>「You don’t have to shout」</p>
<p>『Urushi, take a break until you calm down. You’re amazing』</p>
<p>(Woof)</p>
<p>  Urushi still fell down and went into the shadows to rest. He must have pushed himself so hard that he didn’t have the strength to stand up. But thanks to this, he was able to return to Brutori before the sundown.  We saw a huge antidemon beyond the city. It was dressed like a fetal and was enveloped in a strange liquid.  It was probably less than 300 meters from the city. It would be no exaggeration to say that we were close to the city in this large continent.  </p>
<p>「There aren’t many soldiers on the wall.」</p>
<p>「A lot of antidemons!」</p>
<p>「The fact that the big monsters aren’t moving means that there are more antidemons in there as well. So hurry up!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p> They paused for a moment to let Urushi through the city at once, although it was partly because Urushi had reached his limit. Isario’s board couldn’t move high in the sky, so he had to move on his own.  Isario emitted flames from the feet and back, and then he jumped up at once. It must have been Mea’s multiple activations of the Vernier.  By combining instant acceleration and jump, the two jumped into the city at once. Fran also followed Isario with an aerial jump as he ran through the roofs of the houses as a foothold. </p>
<p>「A lot of people are sitting on the ground」</p>
<p>「The mana must have been sucked out of them.  And I guess they’re also sickened by the evil spirits.」</p>
<p>  They couldn’t resist the giant antidemons’ magic absorption power and lost their mana at once.  Because of this, they seemed to be suffering from something like anemic. Moreover, the dense evil energy released by the giant antidemons covered the entire city, which was also accompanied by an evil sickness.  Perhaps the loss of a large amount of mana made them less resistant to evil energy.  However, the shortage of mana and the evil energy sickness couldn’t be helped either. Fran and Isario hurried through the powerless people and hurried to the giant antidemons.  The closer we got to the gate, the more people were sitting on the floor, and some of them were lying down. If that power was spreading throughout the city, I couldn’t even imagine how much power was flowing into the giant antidemons.  </p>
<p>「If we don’t do something, they’re gonna be dangerous」</p>
<p>「Yeah.  That big thing is going to eat something in the town.The closer we got to the gate, the more people were sitting on the floor, and some of them were lying down. This was because the closer we were to the giant antidemons, the more magic power absorption power increased. If that power was spreading throughout the city, I couldn’t even imagine how much power was flowing into the giant antidemons. </p>
<p>「If we don’t do something, they’re gonna be dangerous」</p>
<p>「Yeah. That big thing is going to eat something in the town. If we don’t defeat it quickly, the people in the town will die of exhaustion sooner or later」</p>
