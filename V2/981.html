</div><h1>Chapter 981</h1><p>After annihilating the dragonkin, the second unit moved further in the center. Our destination was the castle of Trismegistus, while defeating the antidemons that appeared along the way. We didn’t know if Velmeria and her mother Tilanaria had really been captured there. However, Frederick seemed to have some assurance, so we headed for the center without hesitation. I thought the closer we got to the castle of Trismegistus, the more intense the interference would be, but there were no dragonkin. I thought the closer we got to Trismegistus’ castle, the more intense the interference would be, but there were no dragonkin.  The only ones who attacked were antidemons. The Dragon King might be able to control the antidemons, but I don’t know if that was because of his ability.  There were many antidemons in the center of the continent, and there was a possibility that the number of them increased with the appearance of giant-types earlier. In the end, after the first battle, the second unit arrived at the castle of Trismegistus without encountering any dragonkin.  But it seems that was their strategy too.  </p>
<p>「Oi oi! Hey, don’t you have a lot of dragonkin.」</p>
<p>「There’s a lot of dragonkin.」</p>
<p>  A little later, we met up with the dragonkin’s army at the castle of Trismegistus. We already had a glimpse of our destination castle.  It would take less than an hour.  </p>
<p>「Well, what should we do now?  I don’t look like we’re going to be listening to them......」</p>
<p>「There are 200 people, and they seem pretty strong. Are we going to bypass them?」</p>
<p>「No, yeah, we can’t let them get away.」</p>
<p>  The closer we got, the more swordsmanship we were unleashed by them. It must be an enemy by any stretch of the imagination.  Isario and Fran were in the lead, and the adventurers and soldiers formed a formation behind them. The two of them must have thought that it might suddenly turn into a battle. And their guesses were correct.  When the distance between us reached about 200 meters, the dragonkin started to move. They formed a line and rushed straight in.  </p>
<p>「Tsk!」</p>
<p>  Isario stepped forward and unleashed his magic power. He must have used his provoking skill, but it did not affect the entire dragonkin.  At most, about 30 of them had been caught.  </p>
<p>「All of us, take out your weapons! Take the vanguard with your shield!」</p>
<p> At your command, they all readied their weapons.  However, the dragonkin’s fighting ability was far beyond our expectations.  </p>
<p>「Grrrr!」</p>
<p>「Lugaaaaah!」</p>
<p>  They already seemed to have lost their mind from the beginning, but their abilities must have increased instead. Although they were not shown in appraisal, I guess they were in a state close to Potential Release by unchecking the limiters.  Moreover, even though they were not evil dragonkin, I could sense evil spirits inside them. Like I thought, they were not in a decent state.  The old soldiers, who had been fighting evenly with any opponent up until now, were blown away by the first fierce clash. The adventurers’ shields were desperately trying to stop the dragonkin, but they were completely outmatched.  From their equipment, it seems that the dragonkin here were originally veteran warriors. That was why their power was on a different level from the low-ranked warriors defeated by Isario.  </p>
<p>「Urushi! Everyone’s support!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「I’ll take care of him!」</p>
<p>  Fran’s gaze was fixed on a single dragonkin, emitting a particularly powerful magical power.  If he were to plunge into us, the damage would be tremendous.  He was a strange-looking fire dragonkin covered in poisonous red scales all over his body.  His arms were twice as long and thick as normal. It was as if he had really implanted a dragon’s arm.  His balance was too bad to even move at all. His arms were just so big and long.  However, he was strong. Perhaps he had used the Sacrament of the Dragon God that Frederick mentioned before.  </p>
<p>「...I’m not going any further than here.」</p>
<p>「Are you normal?」</p>
<p>「I swear allegiance to the Dragon King-sama!」</p>
<p>  The dragonkin shouted, and quickly closed the distance.  Was this guy their commander? Anyways, the other adventurers were probably too heavy to handle, so we had to handle it ourselves.  That’s when we heard Frederick’s voice. He warned us while dealing with the dragonkin.  </p>
<p>「Black Lightning Princess!  This man is Resalva, the elder of the dragonkin in the northern reservations!  He’s one of the dragonkin’s best warriors! Don’t let your guard down!」</p>
<p>  Scales covered his face, so I couldn’t tell his age at first glance, but he seemed to be an elder. Since dragonkin were long-lived, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that the older they were, the stronger they were. If they were strengthened, they would be quite tough.  </p>
<p>「Treacher! A dragonkin would never fall in front of a King!」</p>
<p>「Who would fall down to a self-proclaimed king!?」</p>
<p>「You little girl! He’ll tear you apart next to the little girl!」</p>
<p>  I thought he was uncontrollable, but the boil point was exactly the same.  He just didn’t lose his mind, and it seemed to be under the influence of mental manipulation.  Well, that doesn’t mean he can’t hold back. </p>
<p>「I’m done here, so I can’t tear Frederick into eight pieces.」</p>
<p>「You son of a bitch! I’ll kill you!」</p>
<p>「You’d better not tell me what’s impossible. You’ll be a liar」</p>
<p>「Nugaa!」</p>
<p>  Fran decided to imitate Isario and provoke him. After all, those who were angry were easier to fight because their movements were monotonous.  However, even if they were monotonous, their movements were unusually fast. </p>
<p>「Shaaa!」</p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>  Even though she knew that she could cut them, Fran could not avoid them and took them for me. There was no sign of attack.  </p>
<p>『Fran! This thing exploded with flames coming from his back!』</p>
<p>  It was the same as Colbert’s silence in the martial arts tournament. He accelerated not with his own strength, but with the force of flames coming from his weakened state.  As a result, Fran’s timing was missed and forced to take a thrust. Moreover, the power of that blow was tremendous.  My durability value was considerably reduced.  </p>
<p>『It’s not just about my strength. It’s his sword, a magic sword.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p> It doesn’t have any special abilities, but its attack power was over 800 by default and its conductivity was A.</p>
<p>「That’s my fucking line!」</p>
