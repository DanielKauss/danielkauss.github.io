</div><h1>Chapter 1082</h1><p>Princess Selimair and Princess Miriam were brought back to Barbra with their shackles removed. They woke up along the way and were happy to cry that they were freed. However, they soon remembered their younger sister. On behalf of the group, Selimair asked Fran about Marl. On behalf of the giant Urushi, the two princesses were sitting in the seiza pose. It was quite surreal, but they were all serious. </p>
<p>「Where is Marl now?」</p>
<p>「Where is Marl now?」</p>
<p>「Mahl has become a spirit」</p>
<p>「Huh?  A spirit, huh?」</p>
<p>『No, that’s not enough to get them to talk.』</p>
<p> The princesses looked puzzled. Well, it couldn’t be helped though.  In the first place, it was impossible to imagine a person being transformed into a magic beast and then a spirit.  Even I don’t even know why this happened. It was the result of multiple miracles. However, soon the princesses were unable to accept it.  </p>
<p>「Is this...Mal?」</p>
<p>「Mal! What did you look like...」</p>
<p>  Marl appeared. Although I couldn’t hear him, it seemed that he was exchanging information with the Princesses via telepathy.  It only took about a dozen seconds for Marl to appear, but it seemed that Selimia and Miriam believed Fran’s words. </p>
<p>「Thank you for making Marl’s wishes come true」</p>
<p>「... Thank you」</p>
<p>  She was bowing her head with tears in her eyes. However, Fran was looking worried about the place where Marl had been.  </p>
<p>『What’s wrong?』</p>
<p>(Mal said he was very weak by forcing himself)</p>
<p>『Is that okay?』</p>
<p>(She said she’ll sleep a little)</p>
<p>  With the release of the water dragonkin barrier, that figure was so unreasonable that it looked like her sisters.  The spirit-looking Marl must have pushed himself quite hard. She fell asleep inside Fran.  The Princess and sister seemed to be worried, but we couldn’t do anything to help them since they couldn’t use spirit magic. In the end, all we could do was bow our heads to Fran and ask her to. Even during such exchange, Urushi continued to fly in the sky, and in no time at all, he was in Barbra.  The aftermath of the battle with the fleet was visible from Barbra, and they seemed to have shifted to a vigilant stance. In the port of Barbra, a scout group of adventurers, including Gumdo, was waiting for us.  They noticed Urushi in the middle of the fight and greeted him.  </p>
<p>「Fran!  What’s going on!?  Was he the same Raydoss guy again?」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「I see...  Hmm? Who are they?」</p>
<p>「 princess」</p>
<p>「Huh?  Princess-sama?」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>  Fran rescued Seedran’s princesses from the Raydoss Kingdom’s fleet and explained that all of their enemy ships had sunk.  I’m not privy to Marl’s and the fact that she used cursing magic to destroy their contract. It’s hard to explain Marl to them, and I don’t want to know anything about the curse magic.  I’ve asked the princesses to stop me.  As for me, I think it’s time for curse magic to shine though. But even if they don’t make a slave contract, I usually don’t want to interfere with Fran.  But Fran didn’t like it. Even if she didn’t become a slave, she seemed to be reluctant to the contract using magic itself.  When this happens, we would have to trust them. There was no lie that she would never tell anyone, so we should be fine for the time being.  I would really like to exchange information with Gumdo, but I don’t have time to relax here. Fran then led Gumdo to a distance and explained the Shallus Kingdom to them.  </p>
<p>「That country!?  There had been a lot of problems at the Adventurers Guild too」</p>
<p>「The Western Duke of the Raydoss Kingdom is the Chancellor」</p>
<p>「Seriously!  The country’s Chancellor is famous for being efficient, but I never thought she would do something about that...」</p>
<p>  I had heard before that the King was new and he was a little incompetent. But in reality, he might be under the control of the Chancellor. </p>
<p>「He said that he will attack from the Shallus Kingdom after they attack from the sea」</p>
<p>「So you’re saying that time is running out, right?」</p>
<p>「Nn. I’m going」</p>
<p>  Fran was looking motivated, but she was restrained by a gang. But she wasn’t asking him to stop because it was too dangerous. </p>
<p>「I’m coming too!」</p>
<p>「Are you sure you want to go to Bulbola?」</p>
<p>「Submaster and lord are here, so it’s not a problem.  It’s more important to prevent the troops from coming from the Shallus Kingdom! Besides, you can’t be so mossy and keep quiet like this!」</p>
<p>  The last reason seems to be the most important, but Gamud won’t be a hindrance. In fact, our battlefield experience is far better than that.  </p>
<p>「Get ready in ten minutes.  Then bring it with you」</p>
<p>「You’re right! Wait!」</p>
<p>  From there, Gwad’s actions were quick.  He used adventurers as messengers, told everyone about the Shallus Kingdom’s threats and the fact that he was heading to the defense, and in no time, he got their approval. Well, in fact, he just yelled at the person who came to stop them and silenced them.  His equipment was in a battle mode, so he was already ready for departure. As a result, he really had completed his preparations for departure in ten minutes. </p>
<p>「Let’s go, Fran!」</p>
<p>「Nn.  Ride」</p>
<p>「I’ll get in your way. I’m quite heavy, is it okay for me?」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  Urushi didn’t seem to be frightened when he was climbed up by the Gumdo, who was carrying a huge hammer on his back in his full body armor.  He jumped out into the sky with the same movements as usual. Seeing him, he smiled in a excited manner.  </p>
<p>「That was amazing!  Even a Wyvern cannot fly long distances with me on board! As expected of a high-ranking magic beast!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p> As we made our way through the sky, Gumdo gave us instructions for our path.  </p>
<p>「If we want to enter the Kranzel Kingdom from the Shallus Kingdom, there is only one way. The other one was quite steep and it’s not suited for large armies.  We’ll definitely pass through it」</p>
<p>「Okay」</p>
<p>「If possible, I don’t want to invade the Shallus Kingdom’s territory. If we fight in this country, we’ll have an advantage in the aftermath」</p>
<p>  Gumdo gave us a map and told us where to go on the battlefield.  It was a barren wilderness that extended from the south-eastern part of the Kranzel Kingdom.  The troops from Shallus certainly passed through, and there were no towns or villages on Kranzel’s side.</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
