</div><h1>Chapter 1010</h1><p>Barbarianly rough. But it’s not like she’s being rough at all. Fran’s movements now were both angry and calm. Maybe her killing intent was sharpening her wild intuition. She must have subconsciously understood that rampaging with anger was not enough to kill him. The Sword God Transformation had already been canceled, but her movements were getting sharper and sharper. Moreover, she was violent. Fran was moving around Trismegistus in a disturbing way. Fran was moving around Trismegistus in a disturbing way.  She used aerial jumps, wind magic, and fire magic. In addition, she used pillars created by earth magic and magic threads that she had set up between them to fly, turn, and jump.  Her movements were unusually tricky and fast, like a ball of pinballs that she had repelled with all her might. It seems that she’s starting to master Swordking Mastery with her instincts.  Her experience with the optimized and flawless movement of the Sword God Transformation ahead must have affected Swordking Mastery. It is strange that she is changing to a more elaborate fighting style that uses a lot of high-speed movement rather than a simple fighting style like the Sword God Transformation... However, because she understood the distance between the tops, she seemed to be perfecting her Sword King skills that took advantage of her own strengths.Because she understood the distance from the top, she seemed to be perfecting her Swordking Technique, taking advantage of her current strengths.  However, even so, she could not break through Trismegistus’ defenses.  This man was also a wielder of Swordking Technique.  Moreover, he had an enormous amount of combat experience. In contrast to Fran, who was on the receiving end of a lightning attack with divine speed three-dimensional mobility, Trismegistus had a huge mountain-like presence that did not move from the spot and turned around with his wide field of view and insight.  </p>
<p>「Hah!」</p>
<p>「Hmm!」</p>
<p>  Lightning Stone Fire and Awakening.  If Fran was the Swordking Mastery of Movement, then Trismegistus was Still Swordking Mastery. Even though he was using the same skill, his style of fighting was so different. I guess it all depends on the individual’s qualities and experience.  Besides, there were other things that were bothering me besides the fight.  It was Trismegistus’ eyes. I thought about it when I noticed Urushi hiding in the shadows, but he had deep eyes that let him see through everything.  His eyes were not just good, but they made me think that he could see into the rest of the world, from the back.  I had been observing us with those strange eyes for a long time now. I felt as if everything other than Fran’s movements was being seen through.  </p>
<p>「Colos!」</p>
<p>「Just try it!」</p>
<p>「Raaaaah!」</p>
<p>  The battle between slashes became even more violent.  Their intentions were mixed, and the match was filled with fact. It was a very dense exchange of blows between the Sword Kings, even if only for a short time.  Even I could see them being almost equal.  If I compare Trismegistus and Fran, they were losing in many aspects. However, only when they were skilled in their swordsmanship could they be fighting on the same playing field.  However, if their swordsmanship was on the same level, Trismegistus, who was immortal, had an overwhelming advantage. He could utilize his full power without worrying about any exhaustion or backlash. Fran, on the other hand, was not without the blessings of the Beast Bug God, even though the backlash of the Divine Attribute had been reduced.  If he was even more motivated, the situation would turn sour at once.  The longer the fight dragged on, the worse we would be. Even so, the reason why I didn’t stop her instantly was because she might be able to get a hit on her.  Apparently, if she dies, she will resurrect between the thrones. He was licking us, and if he died immortal, there was a good chance that he would be exposed to a huge gap. In the midst of the fierce battle, Trismegistus muttered something.  </p>
<p>「... I see.  Let’s try it.  Okay?」</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>『Fran! Juanaverta is going to do something!』</p>
<p>  It looked like he was suddenly saying something to himself, but I guess Juanaverta was giving him orders. Immediately after my warning, Trismegistus’ gaze turned to us.  I didn’t see anything wrong with his sword, but――  </p>
<p>「Impatient.  </p>
<p>『The original sin of jealousy.』</p>
<p>「Eh?」</p>
<p>『Fran! Shit!』</p>
<p>  What happened?  The activation was so terrifyingly fast that I couldn’t avoid it! For just a moment, Fran’s movements suddenly slowed down as the countless tentacle-like magic power released by them seemed to have enveloped Fran.  On the other hand, Trismegistus’ movements were accelerating. Fran’s face would have been slashed by Juanaverta’s blade because she was puzzled by the large difference in speed that was born in an instant. If I hadn’t been quickly defeated by telekinesis and wind magic, her head might have been cut off.  However, she was not able to do it in time completely, and she was deeply slashed from her right jaw to her ear.  While healing with recovery magic, she also used flame magic to accelerate and leave at once. Fran’s back, which was slipping on the ground while being dragged by me, was chipped away with blood, but it was better than dying!  </p>
<p>「Miss Hilt!」</p>
<p>  I could see Isario running toward her after blowing up the antidemons. I guess it was as if Fran had taken a heavy hit. </p>
<p>「Are you okay!?」</p>
<p>「Nn.  I’m fine」</p>
<p>  Fran stood up, wiping the blood off her face.  Well, it’s not as bad as it looks, but I’m still worried that she’ll cut her face.  </p>
<p>『Fran, what happened?』</p>
<p>(Suddenly, my body got heavy.  All the various enhancements have disappeared.)</p>
<p>『I see.  The ability to forcefully release strengthening! No, if you look at the changes in Trismegistus, it might be a skill that takes away the opponent’s strengthening』</p>
<p>(But...)</p>
<p>『But, what’s wrong?』</p>
<p>(It recovered its magic power)</p>
<p>『Huh?』</p>
<p> Now that you mention it, Fran’s magic power was almost full. In other words, did she allow her to recover her magic power instead of losing the strengthening effect?  I didn’t understand.  However, the fact that she had received an unknown ability seemed to have calmed down Fran a little. Her murderous intent was considerably suppressed.  </p>
<p>「... What did you do?」</p>
<p>「Hmm.  If Isario is there, I’ll let you know.  I’ll tell you then.  The name of the power I used was </p>
<p>『The source of jealousy』</p>
<p>.  It was the ability to force an equivalent exchange with an object. That was the ability to deprive a part of her power and impose magic power on her earlier」</p>
<p>「It’s still a ridiculous ability. The only salvation is that you can’t use it continuously, huh?」</p>
<p>  I see.  So, it was exchange rather than robbery huh!? However, unlike our skill taker, it seemed that various things can be forcibly exchanged, such as magic power and buffs under strengthening.  </p>
<p>「With this power, you can take away the skills and other skills that your girl has.  Why don’t you hold out the sword before you lose something important?」</p>
<p>「...There is nothing more important than this sword!」</p>
<p>『... Ah, disgusting little girl.  Oh, disgusting! I’m jealous of those eyes full of life force...』</p>
<p>  Suddenly, a woman’s screech echoed in our minds.  The voice alone was enough to understand the malice coming at us.  </p>
<p>「!」</p>
<p>『Is this Juanaverta?』</p>
