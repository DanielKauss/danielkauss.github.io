</div><h1>Chapter 1117</h1><p>The night before tomorrow’s cargo transport, Fran had been to Klimut, the guild. As Fran knocked harder at the door, there was a scream from inside. Klimut looked bitter as he entered the building. </p>
<p>「You’ve told me not to enter before answering me, right? I’m still feeling the same way! And please be a little calmer when you knock」</p>
<p>「I heard a strange voice, so I thought you had replied」</p>
<p>「I thought you had replied because I heard a strange voice.」</p>
<p>「H-Strange...... My status is back to normal and I’m hearing better, but I’m not used to it yet.」</p>
<p>  So, even if he knew that a knock was coming from her, he was surprised by the loud noise. On his desk, about twenty gem-like stones were lined up.  He was holding a cloth in his hand and seemed to have been sharpening it.  It was a magic stone.  Moreover, it seemed to have quite strong magic power. Klimut put the magic stones in the bag as if to hide from Fran’s gaze.  </p>
<p>「W-what is it?」</p>
<p>「It’s a piece of cloth?」</p>
<p>「Y-yes. Aah, we’ve been through this before.  There were ten magic stones with a threat level of C and D at that time...  Of course, that wasn’t all.  So, we didn’t give them all. At that time, Fran negotiated and pulled out five of them, but from Klimut’s point of view, it must have been within Klimut’s expectations.  Perhaps, even if all of them were taken, if Fran accepted the request, there would have been no problem for Klimut. So, Klimut was really good at negotiating.  Klimut coughed it away lightly and changed his topic.  </p>
<p>「Did you need something?」</p>
<p>「Nn. When Fran nodded, Klimut sighed wearily.  </p>
<p>「Haah...  It’s still the same as before」</p>
<p>  He deposited his body deeply on his back and shook his head several times.  </p>
<p>「It’s not something that other races besides the Elves can easily learn... If you don’t want to answer, you don’t have to answer, but when and how did you learn it?」</p>
<p>「It’s only recently that I’ve learned something.」</p>
<p>  He’s begging for lessons.  It’s indeed too good to be completely silent. She would have to talk to some extent. Fran, while hiding my identity――. </p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p> Suddenly fell silent in the middle of the explanation. </p>
<p>「What’s wrong?」</p>
<p>  Klimut looked puzzled.  </p>
<p>『Fran?』</p>
<p>(Master.  Can I tell Klimut?)</p>
<p>  Oh, so that’s how it is.  From the moment we met, there was a subtle atmosphere between Fran and Klimut. Fran, who had not fully trusted the guild, and Klimut, who hadn’t fully trusted Fran. It was an atmosphere that respected each other but also looked at each other with certainty.  But before I knew it, Fran had completely cleared her guard against Klimut.  I already trusted Klimut. There was no denying it.  Besides, even if he kept quiet, it was going to be seen through by the great spirits.  </p>
<p>「Klimut, there’s something important to discuss」</p>
<p>「Eh?  Ha-ha.  It’s so sudden, isn’t it?」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p> Klimut looked as surprised as ever, but after Fran made a wind barrier, he realized that it was really important.  He straightened up his posture and looked at Fran.  </p>
<p>「Let’s ask him about it」</p>
<p>「About this sword」</p>
<p>  Fran took me with her scabbard and held me up high.  Klimut’s gaze followed me, but a puzzled look appeared on her face. She knew that it was a vicious magic sword that emitted evil energy, but she didn’t understand why she was giving it a shot right now.  </p>
<p>「Master」</p>
<p>『Ou』</p>
<p>「Hmm?  His voice now is...?」</p>
<p>『The sword in front of us.  My name is Master, and I’m Master, an intelligence weapon. Nice to meet you!』</p>
<p> I purposely greeted her in a light atmosphere so that it didn’t become too heavy, but...  </p>
<p>「Eeh?  No, Eeh?  The sword is talking...  Eeh?」</p>
<p>  Klimut was really surprised.  Well, it couldn’t be helped.  Even if it was more than a Divine Sword in terms of rarity, right? But he might have been a little too surprised.  </p>
<p>「I-I’ve never encountered a legendary being in a place like this... And it’s bad for my heart!」</p>
<p>  Klimut was holding his heart and was breathing heavily.  This man was a handsome and super strong high-ranking adventurer, but he was quite a common-sense person or rather, a coward. He seemed to have a lot of trouble in his heart.  </p>
<p>「I’ve heard that he exists in Gordicia, but this is my first time seeing him in person」</p>
<p>「You believe me?」</p>
<p>「I have no reason for you to lie. In the first place, I usually have conversations with spirits, so I can be sure that their telepathy is coming from their swords.」</p>
<p>  They were used to telepathy and seemed to have perfectly understood what I was talking about.  </p>
<p>「Have you ever been to Gordicia?」</p>
<p>「That place is like a demon gate for spirit magicians.  It’s because just by summoning them, the spirits weaken and won’t heal. I think the reason why the elves were destroyed was because they couldn’t use spirit magic now, right?」</p>
<p>「I see.  So, Master is your first Intelligence Weapon?」</p>
<p>「That’s right.  But, Master, huh? It’s a strange name for a magic sword」</p>
<p>『I didn’t have a name for it, so Fran gave it to me! That’s a good name, right?』</p>
<p>  It was the usual exchange after we revealed the identity, but Klimut was, as expected, an adult.  </p>
<p>「It’s a good name.  I can feel Fran’s sense」</p>
<p>『You’re right, aren’t you?  That’s a good name!?』</p>
<p>「Fufun」</p>
<p>  Klimut looked at Fran with a gentle look on her face. He was a good one after all.  </p>
<p>「But now I understood that. So, the unbalance of Fran-san was due to Master-san’s ability, right?」</p>
<p>『Yes.  My ability is――』</p>
<p>  When I gave her a brief description of my power, Klimut clutched his eyebrows and groaned.  Well, I understand how you feel. I’m sorry, okay?  </p>
<p>「A super first-rate magic sword is in a place like this...  It’s almost as good as a divine sword, you know? Are you glad to reveal it to me?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Klimut can be trusted」</p>
<p>「... Haah.  I can’t betray you if you say it so straightforwardly. I’m not that kind of person」</p>
<p>  He looked up to the sky with his eyes covered.  He couldn’t stop blurring.  But as expected of Klimut. She seemed to remember that she was in the middle of talking right away. </p>
<p>「So, what’s the relationship between Spirit Magic and Master-san?」</p>
<p>『Actually――』</p>
<p>  Klimut fidgeted his eyebrows and clutched his stomach with his free left hand. He seemed to be being attacked by a double punch of headache and stomach pain.  </p>
<p>「I can’t say anything about it because it’s too irregular.  However, I could feel the presence of a spirit inside Fran-san. It seems to have been so weakened that I couldn’t tell without being told」</p>
<p>  I know that she had supported Fran during the Great Spirit Battle. She should have become stronger for a moment, but after that, her presence disappeared again.  </p>
<p>「Is Marr okay?」</p>
<p>「I don’t know.  I only know of a being who has changed from a person to a spirit in my legends. However, as Fran’s level of spirit magic gets higher and higher, I may be able to supply her with power」</p>
<p>「Really?」</p>
<p>「Yes.  It’s not always easy to level it up, you know? In the beginning, we would only have to focus on sensing spirits」</p>
<p>「But still, I’ll do my best」</p>
<p>Klimut shrugged his shoulders in disbelief.Klimut shrugged his shoulders in disbelief. However, he had a soft smile on his face, like an old man watching over his granddaughter.</p>
