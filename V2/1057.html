</div><h1>Chapter 1057</h1><p>As we were eating our meal at the harbor, people started to gather one after another. The smell of the curry didn’t catch them――or rather, the sound of the battle was cut off, so they must have come to see what was going on. And as the word spread that there were even more people in the harbor, they began to gather at the harbor one after another. We couldn’t help but serve the food to the chewy brats and the others who came after them. We also had quite a few acquaintances we met during the cooking contest. We also had quite a few acquaintances we met during the cooking contest.  As a result, they continued to serve the food in their storage and eventually looked like they were ready to cook.As a result, they continued to serve dishes from their storage, and before they knew it, they looked like they were ready to cook.  They were even busier than during the battle, as the soldiers they had stolen from the Raydoss fleet were unloaded to cook the bean and wheat, and Urushi caught the fish from the sea in front of them.  The cooks and cooks who brought the ingredients with them also joined in as well, and in the end, the tournament became a large cooking tournament of thousands of people.  A staircase was placed next to the huge pot, which could fit several people, and hundreds of soups were stirred with spears. Somehow, it reminded me of the Yamagata’s potatoes cooking association.  There were a lot of smiles in the harbor.  Some of them were badly injured, but they were smiling, even if they were in good spirits or pushing themselves too hard. They probably knew that it couldn’t be helped if they were depressed.  Besides, they were not fighting each other.  Everyone was sharing their food with each other. I could feel the strength of the people of Barbra.  </p>
<p>「Fran.  It seems that they defeated all the people of Raidos Kingdom in addition to the people who cooked the meals. Thank you very much」</p>
<p>「Meccham.」</p>
<p>  The old man sat down on the edge of the harbor, talking to Fran while she was eating her curry while looking at the sea. He was Meccham, the natural enemy of Fran and a bigwig in the cooking guild.  I’m sure Fran viewed him as a rival more than any other adventurer from around there.  </p>
<p>「And this time’s cooking... It was a long time and the food was served in a bowl, but is it okay?  As for the fighting, even amateurs were professional when it came to cooking. It seemed that she saw the food served and understood that the cost of ingredients would be quite high.  However, Fran shook her head.  </p>
<p>「Don’t worry. I’m using the ingredients I’ve taken from my enemies, and you can defeat the magic beast again」</p>
<p>「... Is that so?  However, what was originally what the Cooking Guild would have to do.  If you ever have any problems with cooking in the future, come to ask for advice. I’ll be of assistance」</p>
<p>「Nn.  Okay」</p>
<p> Meccham said he was not going to give us money. He might have to pay for the reconstruction of the attack, but he must have understood Fran’s intentions.  </p>
<p>「Fran-san.  Thank you very much. It seems that the children were also well-rested」</p>
<p>  The next person to call out to us was Io-san of the orphanage. She said that someone from the orphanage had told her about the soup kitchen and had brought the children with her. It may sound a little awkward, but I guess the adventurers had guards too, and they couldn’t keep the children in the basement the whole time.  Amanda was known to be concerned about them, so there was no connection between them. In fact, it was as if everyone was watching over them.  Fran and the people of the town were all smiles on the faces of the children as they ate their meal.  </p>
<p>「What about Charlotte?」</p>
<p>「That girl has moved north」</p>
<p>「The fight with Raydoss?」</p>
<p>「No, it’s Dards」</p>
<p>  I wondered if she was participating in a war in the north, but Charlotte was said to be out of town of Dards. There was a festival to pray for a good harvest and she was invited to perform as a dance for that festival.  </p>
<p>「Are you going to Dards?  When?」</p>
<p>「I left about a week ago. I think he’s already in Dards by now...」</p>
<p>  I heard that Dards had already been attacked by Raidos...  Is Charlotte safe? Fran was also worried.  Without saying anything to Io, she headed to a corner where the adventurers were gathered. Now that we’ve figured out the restraints of Seedran’s crew members, we can eat and drink while building up our spirits, before we can pull up the supplies and materials we can use.  </p>
<p>「Gamd!」</p>
<p>「Fran, what’s wrong?」</p>
<p>「I want to know what’s going on with Dards.」</p>
<p>「...... This way.」</p>
<p>  It must not be something that can be said so frankly. Gamd took Fran away.  </p>
<p>「To be honest, I don’t know the details.」</p>
<p>「Did you contact me for any reason?」</p>
<p>「Hey.  I’ve sent you a message, but I didn’t get any response.  If what they say is true, this is...」</p>
<p>「I see...」</p>
<p>  It’s not a good idea to have no news in this situation. By any stretch of the imagination, we could not get out of here.  </p>
<p>「Barbra had sent a number of adventurers to the Dars festival.」</p>
<p>  This request was not a personal request to Charlotte, but a request between the guilds. Therefore, ten people, including guards and negotiators, were sent to them.  Among them were three of our acquaintances, the Scarlet Maiden, and Eugene, an alchemist. The Scarlet Maiden was supposed to be her escort, and Eugene was supposed to give a lecture at Dars.  </p>
<p>「Fran.  You guys, what are you planning to do now? I’d appreciate it if you stay in this town for a long time, but that’s not your intention, right?」</p>
<p>「I’m going to Alessa」</p>
<p>「I see...  Hey, can you take a request?」</p>
<p>「Request?」</p>
<p>「Ou.  I’d like you to take a look at the coastal area, including Dars. How is it?」</p>
<p>  I thought that the terrible wounds carved by Linford had finally healed, but it was a great damage again. They don’t have enough time to send adventurers to town.  Apparently, after they contacted Dars, the magic tools in the communication channel had been turned into ashes by the magic cannon shots at the entire guild. They can’t use them anymore. In that case, she thought it was most reliable to ask Fran, an outside adventurer and a fast-witted person, to gather information about various places.  Besides, Fran was not aware of it, but Gumdo probably didn’t want to send Fran to Alessa.  He would definitely be involved in a war.  It would be better to give her a request to gather information about the port town. That was what they seemed to be aiming for. </p>
<p>『Fran.  I think I can accept this request』</p>
<p>(But...  Are you sure you want to go to Alessa?)</p>
<p>『A lot of adventurers went to the north, and Klimut, Amanda, and Jean are here in the first place, you know? And Fran, for example, was not worried that Alessa would be taken down.  But still, she was worried about it. However, there was someone more worried about her here. In the end, Fran decided to accept the request of Gwad.  </p>
<p>「Nn.</p>
<p>「Nn!</p>
<p>「Nn! Don’t worry!」</p>
