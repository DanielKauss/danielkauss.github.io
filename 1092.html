</div><h1>Chapter 1092</h1><p>「Uwaah, I didn’t expect Fran-san to be so skilled in dismantling! That’s a good estimate」</p>
<p>「Fermus is also amazing」</p>
<p> A few days after we slew the mountain dragons, we dismantled them in the training area of the Adventurer’s Guild in Barbra. They were originally supposed to be dismantled in a proper facility. After all, even a small piece of meat, a piece of scales, and a drop of blood flowing down from them was precious. A single bottle was not the size of a gold coin, but several pieces of silver. A single bottle was not the size of a gold coin or anything like that, but it can still hold a few silver coins.  Moreover, the mountain dragon this time was a high-ranking dragon, and the value of its material was also higher than normal. The Adventurer’s Guild was also in an uproar because they could get more than normal.  I was the one who got the magic stones, and Eiworth and Fermus would use their share.  Even so, the share of Gumd and Diaz would definitely be channeled to the Adventurer’s Guild’s distribution network. A large amount of high-ranking dragon materials could cause commotion in various places.  If there was no war between the two, there would have been an auction or an information war between the nobles.  However, in the case of mountain dragons, they were not allowed to enter the dismantling facility. After all, they were giants on the level of 100 meters.  And if they couldn’t get into the facility, it would be difficult to dismantle them properly.  No, it wouldn’t be a problem wherever they were just dismantling, but their blood would be wasted considerably. So, Fran and the old men discussed the plan and decided to dismantle the mountain dragon together. At first, Fran and Eiworth set up a wind and ice magic barrier to catch the blood from spilling out. After that, they cut the mountain dragons out of storage for a little while and then roughly cut them apart.  It took less than three minutes for the high-ranking adventurers to get serious on the task of splitting them into about ten meters. Once Fran had retorted it, they dismantled each part in detail within the barrier.  Fran and Fermus were mainly in charge of dismantling the parts.  Since our dismantling skills were already ready, it was only natural and fast. Fran dismantled the mountain dragon at high speed, with me transforming into the optimal shape.  However, Fermus’ skills were quite impressive too.  Their strings were too all-around.  They cut through the meat, peel off the bone and flesh, and cut off the scales all at once. All at the same time.  I was confident in my dismantling, but I’m sure he was losing at a faster pace. As one would expect from a cook and a former Rank A adventurer.  Eiworth then momentarily frozen the materials in a bun, and Gamud and Diaz stuffed them into item boxes. Everyone continued to work silently and silently, and the super huge mountain dragon was dismantled in less than two hours.  </p>
<p>「Hmph!  I never thought I’d be able to get such high-quality materials! I’ve still not left my intuition to say that I should come here!」</p>
<p>「Ayworth!  Your head with poison has lowered the quality of your tongue! You said you wanted that much!」</p>
<p>「Felmus!  Rather than that, is it really okay to get this meat?」</p>
<p>「Is it okay to let him cook not only Barbra, but even Ulmutt?」</p>
<p>  Actually, Eiworth and Fermus have both abandoned their ownership of the meat, which was their share.  Eiworth had no way to use it. As long as Fermus let me cook, that’s all that matters.  Fermus is definitely a tsundere, but Eiworth says he doesn’t need to be serious.  At any rate, it seemed that most of the dragon meat was used to cook the citizens. It was a luxurious way of cooking.  The sight of dozens of huge, cube-shaped meat that surpassed the height of a human was quite impressive. It even felt like a science fiction work’s meat plant rather than a fantasy. Anyway, it was enough to make a connection until we could receive support from the government.  As Fran finished her work, she wiped the sweat from her forehead and approached Gumdo.  </p>
<p>「Fran, why don’t you have a mock battle with me?」</p>
<p>「Mock battle with Gumdo?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. I’d like to experience what it’s like to beat up Felmus and Diaz too.」</p>
<p>「Nn.  Okay」</p>
<p>「Ooh!  I see!」</p>
<p>  The other old men didn’t make any attempts to stop Gumdo.  Diaz and Eiworth were amused, and Felmus was more worried about Gumdo. However, Diaz gave us a one-on-one advice.  </p>
<p>「Nn.  Both of them. I can’t get serious here, so it’s a little light, okay?」</p>
<p>「Ou!」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>  weapons are wooden weapons for mock battles, so I’m sure it won’t be that bad... But if push comes to shove, I’ll try to stop them from moving my arrows.  The mock battle that began with that was as quiet and yet heated as I had expected.  It became a battle only with martial arts skills, without the use of flashy techniques or magic. They didn’t try to do so against each other, but they seemed to have done so while they were keeping each other in check with wait-and-see approach.  At first, Fran attacked lightly, and Gumdo successfully defended with shields and axes.  Both were not serious, but...  Fran seemed to be starting to heat up in the face of Gumdo’s toughness. Without using any skills, she tried to pull off the Gumdo’s defense by herself.  The Gumdo was a bitch, and she must be feeling like stepping on a thin ice.  To Fran, she looked like she had some leeway, but I could see that she was quite panicked. However, it seemed that the elders had decided not to use any skills either.  As a result of this clash of determination, the battle continued with only the use of weapons techniques.  They looked evenly matched, but Gumdo now had a somewhat greater advantage. The defensive side, which moved less, consumed less strength.  Well, I’m sure Gumdot would be far more mentally drained, and the situation would turn into an upside down in a few minutes.  Fran’s attacks were getting sharper and sharper. She had grown up fighting, but it seems she has come this far.  BOOOOOOOOOM!  </p>
<p>「Mrgh......」</p>
<p>「I didn’t manage to withstand my weapon.」</p>
<p>  Fran’s wooden sword had been shattered. Even though it had been strengthened by the flow of magic power, it could not withstand the battle between Fran and Gwad.  </p>
<p>「Phew...  This is a draw.」</p>
<p>「...... Nn.」</p>
<p>  The long-sighed Gwad’s shield cracked as he pulled off a draw, but...  </p>
<p>(Loss.)</p>
<p>『No, I think it’s a pain-sharing skill, okay?』</p>
<p>(......Loss.)</p>
<p> Fran seemed to think of it as a defeat.  Like I thought, she can’t underestimate a cunning opponent who has continued to gain experience. I would be proud of these results against a Gumdo whose strength is stronger than her stats. But it meant that she was on the same level as a former Rank A adventurer who had been in battle for decades without any skills.  The old men were also laughing bitterly when they saw Fran clenching her fists in frustration. However, this personality was what made Fran Fran like.</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
