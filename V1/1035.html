</div><h1>Chapter 1035</h1><p>「Divine Punishment......? Why... I didn’t commit any crimes! It’s the dragonkin who were the culprits! Not only did I try to exterminate the pests, but the Gods who made those lizards were the culprits! It’s wrong to commit a crime by killing them! I’m not wrong!」</p>
<p>I’m starting to pass on the responsibility to the Gods. I wonder is that once I’ve died, it’s starting to unfold again?</p>
<p>Amidst the unbearable screams, the Goddess of Wind and Trees spoke a single word.</p>
<p>「It is my job to protect you from the power of the Evil Gods.」</p>
<p>「Then how about Georg! Resurrect him and give him a proper punishment!」</p>
<p>「Georg had been given the role of son by the piece of the Evil God. So, there’s no problem in taking in Georg’s help」</p>
<p>「Trismegistus then!」</p>
<p>「He has a bond with the piece of the Evil God. Therefore, this is not a crime」</p>
<p>「Hah? The ties? You mean there’s something in there? The Evil Gods? With Trismegistus, who was attacking you?」</p>
<p>「That’s right. The pieces of the Evil Gods contained in the Abyss Eater are willing to be liberated. Therefore, they can give power to those who think of destroying the Abyss Eater, like Trismegistus and Georg」</p>
<p>I see. She had somewhat identified the Abyss Eater with the pieces of the Evil God contained in it, but that didn’t mean she was.</p>
<p>Well, normally he would go berserk if the Evil God Fragment gave him power. Maybe that was the reason for Georg’s strange behavior.</p>
<p>Trismegistus was one of the strongest forces in this world, so it must be able to resist control.</p>
<p>Unconvinced by what he said, Meritte shouted further at the Gods.</p>
<p>「In the first place, it’s the Evil God, isn’t it!? How could it be, the Evil Gods!?」</p>
<p>「Gods are Gods. A person’s wrongdoing of the Divine Principle is a crime. Sinners, take your punishment.」</p>
<p>「Why, why!? Don’t be so stupid! Why am I――」</p>
<p>After informing her, the Gods suddenly left. To be ascending to the sky at high speed, was the place where the Gods were at the end of the sky? Or maybe that’s what they say about living on the moon, that’s not what they say.</p>
<p>While everyone was stunned, Meritte also disappeared at the same time. She must have been teleported somewhere. Could it be Trismegistus’ castle?</p>
<p>If that was the case, I wouldn’t want to get closer and closer to that castle. Well, it was shattered now though.</p>
<p>The disappearance of Trismegistus probably meant that we were safe around the throne room where he was heading back.</p>
<p>No one uttered their voices for a while, but Isario was the first to make a move. Then Jayne and Mea began to raise their voices. Perhaps Divine Swordsmen had a strong resistance to divine energy.</p>
<p>「I can’t stay in here forever, so I have to decide what to do next.」</p>
<p>「It’s necessary to check the castle」</p>
<p>「We’ll have to transport the injured too.」</p>
<p>After that, they split up into two groups.</p>
<p>One was a group that checked the vicinity of the castle. They consisted of Isario, Seliadot, Jayne, and a few other demonkin and dragonkin elites.</p>
<p>The rest were returnees engaged in rescue, care, and transportation of wounded. We were also the dwarves with high transport capabilities. Mea and the other Beast Kingdom members, as well as Hilt and the other Dimitris disciples, were also returnees as escorts.</p>
<p>We were the ones who were going to the castle.</p>
<p>I really wanted to join the return party, but I was still concerned about the condition of Trismegistus. I also wanted to see if Juanaverta would be resurrected or not.</p>
<p>I asked her, “Do you have spares?”, and she answered “No”. But what if we didn’t need any spares and were resurrected along with Trismegistus? The clothes we were wearing would be resurrected together. Maybe Juanaverta was also resurrected.</p>
<p>I wanted to make sure that.</p>
<p>We were walking together in the middle of the wilderness.</p>
<p>The reason why they were not so enthusiastic despite having won was probably because of the high cost. There were also many shocking events, such as Trismegistus’ madness and the Divine Punishment against Merritte.</p>
<p>Everyone was walking in silence, no words in vain. No wait, Jayne was chatting happily with her men.</p>
<p>Surprisingly little attention was paid to us. I made a huge move, but I guess it was as if I had those tools and skills compared to a Divine Sword or a giant antidemon.</p>
<p>(Master, you okay? I’ve absorbed Juanaverta too)</p>
<p>『Yeah, for now』</p>
<p>I was worried that it might take in the source of my jealousy, but it was okay. In cannibalism, unlike magic stone absorption, it was probably not enough to take away all of their skills as they are.</p>
<p>But they could not do anything at all. They had gotten a skill called “Jealous Fragment”. It was a passive skill that put a bonus on contempt and appraisal instead of being stimulated by jealousy.</p>
<p>I could feel Juanaverta’s emotions flowing into us that strong. I had been prepared for this, but it seemed that it had affected us.</p>
<p>The effect was so subtle that I don’t think it would work at all. At the very least, I didn’t think it was making me jealous for now.</p>
<p>『Also, it’s a little hard to tell which one is the result of cannibalize, because it has changed in some areas from eating the cross-shaped magic sword』</p>
<p>My attack power increased by 101 to 1612 after absorbing Overgrowth. Not much for a cross-shaped magic sword and the bearer of hope, Juanaverta.</p>
<p>Each swing of Overgrowth increased by 150. Maybe it was actually Overgrowth that was getting stronger and stronger, and that was what made it so special?</p>
<p>My mana stats were +5,000 and durability was +770. My mana had increased significantly. That’s all I needed to thank you for. By the way, if it was a Divine Sword before it was released, I would already be at the level of an opponent. Well, it was because I had eaten a failed Divine Sword after all.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, it didn’t increase its conductivity. It remained as an SS. And that was the most important skill I had, but...</p>
<p>『Aside from the usual jealousy shards, my skill set has also increased in terms of information handling and commitment』</p>
<p>Processing is a skill that allows you to think of multiple things at the same time, and it seems to be a backwards compatibility of Simultaneous Operations. However, this one works by the simultaneous activation of skills and magic, so you can simply think of it as an improved fighting ability.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s because of Juanaverta, huh? I’ve heard that he was just calm before he got the original crime of jealousy. Oh, but it might also contain the power of a bearer of hope. I’ve heard that he was just like Announcer-san.</p>
<p>Devourance is a little strange. As long as I was thinking of someone, I can get the energy to work for them. That was what it was all about.</p>
<p>So, in my case, I’d get a bonus when I fight for Fran? Well, it doesn’t seem like a bad skill.</p>
<p>Also, my ice and snow skill level had increased from 1 to 3 probably due to my cannibalizing of Juanaverta, a wielder of ice and snow magic.</p>
<p>『So, this one is probably the result of taking in Evian Eater’s abilities』</p>
<p>My gold expression skill had changed to a gold expression skill.</p>
<p>It seems that I can charge the antidemons’ mana into my blade for a while while while while retaining the antidemon-specific power. I cut down antidemons to absorb their mana, then use that power to fight more antidemons.</p>
<p>This was just a skill for fighting antidemons. To be honest, I don’t know when he’ll be leaving this continent soon, so there will be many opportunities to play an active role.</p>
<p>『And this is the end of it all』</p>
<p>Now that the Evil Domination and Evil Spirit Rush had disappeared, a new skill called “Evil Conquest” had been added. This was probably the result of cannibalizing the falldown.</p>
<p>We’ve integrated skills that affect Evil Spirits. The effects are manipulating evil spirits, amplifying evil spirits, eliminating the effects from evil spirits, and allowing communication with the Evil Gods. It seemed to be a higher version of the evil spirits skills we’ve had so far.</p>
<p>Aah, all that was left was her name. Her status was clearly marked as “Human Sword, Master”.</p>
<p>I knew it was powerful, but to think it was a failed divine sword!</p>
<p>I thought back when things had changed, but there’s more to it!</p>
<p>(Not that, that’s pretty cool.)</p>
<p>『...Really?』</p>
<p>(Nn! It’s perfect for Master, a sword but also a person! Super cool)</p>
<p>『Y-You really think so?』</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
<p>I’m Fran’s sword at the same time I’m myself. I have to respect her will as well.</p>
<p>(They look just as good as Master, a very strong, super cool sword)</p>
<p>『...I-I see』</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
<p>If Fran is happy with this name, then that’s all that matters. Let’s do that.</p>
