</div><h1>Chapter 997</h1><p>The place through the passageway was a strange place.</p>
<p>The dome-shaped room was not only spacious but also high, with countless gray roots stretched out all over it, some wriggling as if to beat.</p>
<p>The room of the Rasbos in a shooting game... I think something like this could happen.</p>
<p>A huge gray heart sat in the middle of it.</p>
<p>「Young miss, that must be the core of the Abyss Eater」</p>
<p>「Nn...... I can’t destroy that thing.」</p>
<p>Fran, whose spirit would normally have to try it, said that she couldn’t do it from the start. That was how extraordinary the core of the Abyss Eater was.</p>
<p>The evil energy mixed with the magic power emitted, the amount of power that lies within it, and its presence that made it hard to tell.</p>
<p>The aura he exuded was befitting of the Abyss Eater’s nucleus, created from pieces of the Evil God, and could easily be poisoned just by looking at it.</p>
<p>Even the Great Magic Beast in the lake that Weena Rhyn had destroyed seemed to be of a lower rank in front of this heart.</p>
<p>The shape of the heart was no different from that of a human heart. But it was big. It was probably more than 50 meters long.</p>
<p>Compared to the dragonkin standing in front of it, this one was even bigger.</p>
<p>「Velmeria! Tilanaria-sama! Are you okay!?」</p>
<p>「Oi oi, no matter how you look at it, they’re all insane」</p>
<p>Velmeria was among the dragonkin standing in front of their hearts. However, they did not respond to Frederick’s words and did not look sane, as Isario had muttered.</p>
<p>Velmeria and the red-haired dragonkin standing next to her were no longer in focus. That woman was Tilanaria, Velmeria’s mother and Divine Dragon priestess.</p>
<p>No, it’s not just them. The other large dragonkin man didn’t seem to be conscious either.</p>
<p>He was a terrifyingly magical dragonkin with golden scales like Trismegistus. Was this guy the Dragon King Georg? If so, why did he seem to be losing his mind?</p>
<p>「What are you trying to do?」</p>
<p>「Velmeria! Tilanaria! Shit! Georg, this is what you did!」</p>
<p>Frederick let out a yelp, but the dragonkin didn’t respond. Something was definitely wrong with them.</p>
<p>There was a small figure beside the three dragonkin. They wore deep robes, so they couldn’t even see their faces, but they looked like they were not dragonkin.</p>
<p>Is that robe bastard doing something? It seems to have an effect similar to Seliadot’s wards, but my appraisal doesn’t work on it inside the robe. Who is it?</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection, I saw that the robe bastard had his sword thrust at his heart. It was a magic sword with a rank of being capable of repelling appraisal. It might even have the power of a failed divine sword.</p>
<p>It didn’t look like it was attacking a nuclear weapon, but what on earth was it?</p>
<p>The shape of the sword was strange. At first glance, it looked to be two. It had two hilts, it looked as if the swords were crossed into a cross-section. But the overlapping parts were actually combined to form a single sword.</p>
<p>How do you use it? Like a boomerang?</p>
<p>I tried to appraise her again. I consciously kneaded the magic power of the Divine Attribute and activated the Heavenly Eye skill. By using the Divine Attribute, I can further enhance the skill.</p>
<p>Rather than simply raising the power output, my skill level should go a step deeper.</p>
<p>It makes it easier to manipulate when using body-enhancing techniques, and it makes it easier to reproduce one’s own image with magic. Since it was using Heavenly Eye, it might even work against a superior opponent.</p>
<p>『Gnrgh...... I see it!』</p>
<p>For just a moment. I wasn’t able to see everything, but I still got a lot of information.</p>
<p>『What the hell is that sword’s status...?』</p>
<p>Name: Falldown, Evil Erosion Sword――</p>
<p>ATK: 170</p>
<p>Mana Conductivity: A+</p>
<p>[Skill]</p>
<p>Automatic Repair, Evil Absorption, Evil Domination, Evil Erosion――</p>
<p>That’s quite a feat, but I’m too concerned about the rest. First, the name. Apparently, it’s a fusion of two swords, so I’m sure it’s better.</p>
<p>Besides, I’m also interested in his skills. It’s like he had the ability to manipulate evil energy. I’d like to see it up close, but we can’t go careless.</p>
<p>The dragonkin on the other side were all ready to fight at once.</p>
<p>『Fran! It’s coming!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「I’ll be the Dragon King! No one else will be able to do that!」</p>
<p>Trismegistus remembered Georg’s name. In other words, it meant that the man who was not interested in others remembered his name. That man was strong enough to remember his name.</p>
<p>Trismegistus showed no sign of movement. I guess it meant we could kill each other on our own. They wouldn’t be willing to help us, but wouldn’t they worry about Tilanaria or Velmeria being killed by them?</p>
<p>「My name is Tilanaria! Black Lightning Princess to ask for Velmeria!」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>From the looks of it, Tilanaria didn’t seem to be very strong. Velmeria, on the other hand, had activated Divine Dragon Form. Indeed, Frederick might have had a heavy burden on her.</p>
<p>『We’re in a lot of trouble too!』</p>
<p>(But we have no choice.)</p>
<p>The moment Fran readied me with determination, Velmeria and Frederick moved at once.</p>
<p>『We have to keep Velmeria and Frederick quiet in front of the robe bastard!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Fran also stepped forward and swung me down from above.</p>
<p>「Wrrrooof!」</p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>The claws of Velmeria and I collided, creating a high-pitched sound. Not a sword, but a claw! Just like me...!</p>
