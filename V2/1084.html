</div><h1>Chapter 1084</h1><p>After parting ways with the old people, Fran landed in front of the magic stone soldiers with Urushi. </p>
<p>『Urushi, there’s no way I’m gonna erase it with Bottomless Shadows, right?』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Master. Let’s go」</p>
<p>『Ou! It’s a full-course time!』</p>
<p> The magic stone soldiers didn’t speak much, but they were clearly aware of us. The magic stone soldiers, who were about three meters tall, changed their movements. A Unique that seemed to be a vanguard-type came forward. And in their hands, they were holding steel weapons. In their hands, they were holding a steel armor.  Unlike before, they could appraise the abilities of the magic stone soldiers.  Their stats were mediocre, but they were very tough. In addition to their simple defense, they also had barriers.  Also, the skills used for them were completely different depending on the difference in the abilities of the magic stones that were the source. The magic stone soldiers at the front had fire magic, sword skills, and presence detection, while the magic stone soldiers behind them were skilled in Fisting, Quick Movement, and Jump.  Besides, they didn’t have any skills for arts or knowledge. So, maybe they were chipping away at useless skills.  </p>
<p>「Let’s go!」</p>
<p>『Ou!』</p>
<p>  Fran slashes at him head-on.  </p>
<p>「First of all! Get some shit!」</p>
<p>『Dorya!』</p>
<p>  As she had swordsmanship, the magic stone soldiers were about to take her slashes.  Their movements were smooth, and I didn’t think they were golems. The sword would be able to conduct magic more smoothly than most adventurers, and at the same time, I could feel the increase in magic power.  They must be preparing magic. He was a high-level magic swordsman with a golem habit.  He could catch Fran’s slashes and counterattack with fire magic. I wonder if that was his way of thinking.  But it was a bit naive.  </p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>『Thanks!』</p>
<p>  Fran’s slash passed through as if there was no steel sword there.  An iron sword would never be able to block me now.  I guess he didn’t have the ability to measure the opponent’s fighting power and magic power. If it had been an opponent who had some eyes, I would have been able to detect the extraordinary magic power I was cloaking in. The slash cut through both the magic stone soldiers’ barriers and armor, piercing large wounds.  Unlike before, no Reflection Magic seemed to have been applied to it. There were multiple wards of each attribute, but they were just like paper in front of me now, with a combination of Divine Energy Manipulation and Evil Conquest.  </p>
<p>『Here it comes!  My magic stone value of about 150!  It’s the best prey I’ve ever had!』</p>
<p>「Master looks happy」</p>
<p>『For me, it’s like a treat in a row!』</p>
<p>  But there was something I was a little curious about.  The magic stone value I got was less than the magic stone value of the magic stone soldiers I fought before. As I recalled, I should have gotten magic stone value of about 300 when I absorbed it in Barbra.  Besides, something like a black mist was cling to us. </p>
<p>(This is...?)</p>
<p>『Fran, don’t break the barrier.  This is a curse. Moreover, it’s mixed with evil...』</p>
<p>  It seems that a vicious curse was placed inside the magic stone soldiers. Even if the magic stone soldiers were to be destroyed, it was probably a two-stage plan to attack the destroyer with this curse.  I could see that the evil energy was mixed in, so the barrier was cut down and thinner and thinner. The surrounding area was dyed black by the curse.  Is this all the magic stone soldiers? It might be dangerous if the curse became too thick.  I remembered the time when I was using the demon killer’s knife and tried to use a release curse with Divine Attributes on it. The effect was subtle.  The black mist-like curse, which was exposed to white light, disappeared completely without a trace, emitting a high-pitched scream. I couldn’t feel any evil coming from it, and the black discolored ground also regained its original brown color. It seems that I was able to cleanse it.  </p>
<p>『Alright!  Now I’ve got some countermeasures against the curse! Let’s get going!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  Fran nodded enthusiastically and jumped into the army of magic stone soldiers. I see, they were certainly strong.  The hard vanguard moved around Fran, throwing magic of various attributes without a pause.  They were among their comrades, but the hard magic stone soldiers could ignore some of their shots.  In addition, some of the magic stone soldiers in the back were showing an unusual increase in magic power. They were ready to attack at the same time.  However, Fran would not back down in close combat, and they were absorbed by me one after another. Also, the fact that they would disappear completely if I slashed them was probably a big mistake. The advantage of using simultaneous attacks was that they could use both their bodies to block Fran’s escape and catch up with her.  However, they couldn’t surround Fran at all because the magic stone soldiers would disappear one after another.  That didn’t limit Fran’s movements, and her speed did not change. In fact, if she ran in defenseless, it would only be a waste of my prey.  Someday, the magic stone soldiers were starting to keep their distance from Fran.  Apparently, they were ignoring Fran and were trying to move forward. Are they programmed to avoid threats in the case of any serious damage?  But I guess they’ll let them get away?  </p>
<p>「Wooof!」</p>
<p>  Urushi was now in his role.  With his huge paw, he was able to send the magic stone soldiers flying toward us and flick them off. </p>
<p>「Urushi!  Bring it on!」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>  And so, it was just when Fran and Urushi’s duo had killed nearly a hundred magic stone soldiers.  </p>
<p>《The effect of self-evolution has been activated.But it’s not too bad, isn’t it? </p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p> It was Urushi’s turn. With his huge paw, he was able to deflect the magic stone soldiers towards us. Fran slashed at the magic stone soldiers that were sent flying at her at a tremendous speed with a swing like a batter. </p>
<p>「Urushi! Bring it on!」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p> And so, it was just when Fran and Urushi’s duo had killed nearly a hundred magic stone soldiers. </p>
<p>《The effect of self-evolution has been activated. I’ve earned 100 self-evolution points》</p>
