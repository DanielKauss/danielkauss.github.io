</div><h1>Chapter 950</h1><p>Now that we had the information about Alpha, we asked him for more details about the other Divine Swords. After Alpha, the next thing that was on our mind would be Berserk.</p>
<p>「The Mad God’s Sword Berserk is owned and managed by an organization called the “Monthly Beauty” under the control of General Hagane.」</p>
<p>「Are you a beauty below the moon?」</p>
<p>『It’s the name of the flower that scatters all night long』</p>
<p>The name was beautiful, but also had sinister connotation.</p>
<p>「There was a girl named Hydrangea and Master. Are they the most beautiful of the month?」</p>
<p>「They are definitely Berserk’s wielders, created by General Hagane.」</p>
<p>「It was made?」</p>
<p>「Yes. A homunculus, a mixture of the blood of the first generation and the blood of talented people. That is the divine swordsman of the lower echelons of the moon.」</p>
<p>I never thought that instead of raising her as an wielder of a divine sword, she created a homunculus for it!</p>
<p>But why would they go that far? Can’t they train their aptitudes like Addle? The Silver Lady then explained further that she understood our doubts.</p>
<p>「Have you ever heard of a wielder of Berserk dying?」</p>
<p>「Nn. There.」</p>
<p>「But it seems that the original wielder didn’t die despite all the outbursts.」</p>
<p>「Is that so?」</p>
<p>「Yes」</p>
<p>It seems that Berserk’s restriction of wielders was deeply related to this story.</p>
<p>Berserk originally had a restriction that only the first wielder and his bloodline could use it. If something that did not draw blood was touched for a long time, that alone would be enough to kill it.</p>
<p>But then a big problem came to mind.</p>
<p>To my surprise, the bloodline of the first generation had been cut off for various reasons: war, epidemic, assassination, and those who have decided not to leave any blood behind on their own.</p>
<p>The country that possessed Berserk at that time fell into chaos. It was only natural, since suddenly the best forces were no longer available. In the end, that country was destroyed by civil war and external melancholy.</p>
<p>Later, along with researchers and royalty, it was General Hagane at that time who took in personnel from that country.</p>
<p>At that time, Hagane was only a member of Silard’s mercenary brigade, and was on the side of the exploiter. That’s why he secretly advanced Berserk’s research and managed to devise a way to operate it. Then, he used his power to break free from Silard’s control.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Berserk Operation and research organization, which was made up of personnel from the defeated country, had a special status among the Militants of Hagane.</p>
<p>It seems that the successor of the institute, the Gephe Biscot, had great authority in the Militant Nation of Hagane.</p>
<p>「As a result of many mistakes, Captain Hagane came up with the idea of how to use Berserk to make the first-generation blood-piercing homunculus. However, it is possible to use Berserk because she is not a child, but she will always die after that」</p>
<p>So, the restriction worked halfway through. It was possible to touch it or use the Divine Sword Release, but it was impossible to survive like the first generation. That was the true nature of the rumor that if Berserk was used, he would always die.</p>
<p>「The old man soldiers were chosen by the Militant Nation of Hagane as payment. They wanted to avoid the wear and tear of the Divine Sword users as much as possible. I don’t know why they’re all old men. They don’t talk too much」</p>
<p>If I put my bad imagination to work, it would lead to an idea that would throw me away, but... I think the old soldiers were really motivated to do that.</p>
<p>「Belserk’s restrictions are out of control and binding with blood. His abilities are enhanced with stats of Alpha and higher, and he can draw out the talent and potential of that person」</p>
<p>「You mean that the talent you have is different from the one you get strengthened?」</p>
<p>「Yes. Therefore, it is unknown what kind of abilities will be drawn up by the wielder」</p>
<p>Even if they were to draw the same blood, their talents and abilities would not be exactly the same. If that was the case, did the lesser beautiful Divine Swordsman have no idea what kind of power they would show until they were released?</p>
<p>Moreover, if they always used it to kill someone, then the user would be different every time. In other words, the ability to wield would be different. Could it be that the enemy has no countermeasures to it?</p>
<p>I now understand why Silard, who had Alpha, avoided an all-out war with General Hagane. If he was not careful, there was a good chance that even Alpha would be able to create something helpless.</p>
<p>Moreover, it weakened Alpha and killed her badly in the battle. It had no merit.</p>
<p>「Be careful not to get caught up in it when using it」</p>
<p>「......Nn.」</p>
<p>After thinking about the hydrangea, Fran’s excitement visibly decreased.</p>
<p>「We don’t know about the cost of Berserk. Because the homunculus we used will die」</p>
<p>「I see... Hey, what’s the price for Gaia and Ignis? Are you okay?」</p>
<p>After hearing that, he became concerned about the cost of other Divine Swords. In particular, he was probably worried whether the life of the Divine Swordsman he knew would be safe. He mentioned Gaia and Ignis’ names, with the Silver Lady having information about them.</p>
<p>But the Silver Lady did not change her expression, but she shook her head apologetically.</p>
<p>「I’m sorry, but both Gaia and Ignis had insufficient information on the costs」</p>
<p>Both Ashwrath and Isario seemed to have minimized the use of their divine swords to minimize their wear and tear. Therefore, it seemed that they didn’t know what kind of price this was.</p>
<p>As for Alpha and Berserk, it seems that they have gathered a lot of them by listening to the conversations of their companions and subordinates.</p>
<p>It must be surprisingly difficult for her to get any information on Ashwrath and the other soloists.</p>
<p>「However, I think that the Divine Swords of the first Divine level blacksmith, Ulmer, were likely to come at a similar price. In fact, Cristalos and Tempest were the same price as Alpha」</p>
<p>Alpha, Ignis, Gaia, Cristalos, and Tempest were the divine swords of the same authors, huh?</p>
<p>The Divine Swords made by Urushi gave the impression that they were highly versatile and easy-to-use Divine Swords. This was probably in contrast to the fact that Dionys, his younger brother, was always making strong and vicious Divine Swords.</p>
<p>「So both Ignis and Gaia will have to pay for their level?」</p>
<p>「I think so. It’s just a prediction though」</p>
<p>We were also told about Ignis and Gaia’s abilities. Well, I guess that’s because we’ve been shown Gaia before, and Gallus had also told us about Ignis’s abilities before it was released.</p>
<p>Gaia was earth, Ignis was fire, Cristalos was water, and the tempest was wind. These attributes were specialized and give the wielder the power to manipulate them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, by imbuing the Divine Attribute, damage can be passed through even if it is resistant. We can say that it has an all-powerful ability to play an active role in melee, long-range, physical, and magic attacks.</p>
<p>Crystalos was last seen on the continent of Gordicia nearly a thousand years ago. The plague seemed to have happened even earlier, and the current owner did not know about it.</p>
<p>Cristalos was in the form of a blue and white serber. He might have similar colors to me. I guess he was a little familiar with me. But when I let him go, it would take on an indefinite shape like water or fog. I guess it was Ignis’ water version.</p>
<p>The tempest was an eStock based on green, and seemed to be a little more luxurious after it was released. However, the blades were separated into countless pieces like a locket paint, and the invisible wind sword blade connected between them, allowing them to be used like whips.</p>
<p>The whip of wind shattered the earth with a single blow and destroyed a large army. It was usually terrifying power in Amanda’s whip, but it was probably far beyond that when it came to the Divine Sword.</p>
<p>Since we had only just witnessed the tremendous power of Ignis, both Klisterus and Tempest must be terrifying.</p>
