</div><h1>Chapter 1043</h1><p>When we returned to the inn, we were greeted by holy knights who looked somewhat impatient. In the middle was a magician and appraiser with a creepy smile on their face.</p>
<p>「Oh! You have returned!」</p>
<p>「I’ve been waiting!」</p>
<p>I couldn’t wait for them to call out to Fran. But Fran is on guard, since neither of them can smile.</p>
<p>Well, they only had a sense of distrust in Silard from the beginning though.</p>
<p>「...What is it?」</p>
<p>「It has been decided that we will accept you as an honorary knight in our country!」</p>
<p>「Becoming an honorary knight means I can’t lose my favor or honor! Congratulations!」</p>
<p>Fran tilted her head in confusion. She understood what they were saying.</p>
<p>「Now, please take a look at this inventory!」</p>
<p>「Now all you have to do is take this letter from Your Majesty the King!」</p>
<p>The magician and appraiser offered me a rolled piece of parchment. Both of them were slightly enveloped in magic power.</p>
<p>Perhaps just by receiving Fran’s parchment, they would also consider that some kind of contract has been signed. It was just like the way the Eiworth Magician’s Guild had approached us before.</p>
<p>It must be a common tool in this world to deceive children.</p>
<p>『Fran, don’t take it.』</p>
<p>(I know. These guys are trying to do something about it.)</p>
<p>It must be rude for Fran to be able to see through the conspiracy.</p>
<p>「Unwanted.」</p>
<p>「T-That’s an honorary knight, isn’t it? He is one of the highest ranked knights along with the holy knights!」</p>
<p>「It’s the highest honor that a Beastman would normally not be able to receive, you know? I, please accept it」</p>
<p>「Unwanted. Then」</p>
<p>The holy knights blocked Fran’s way as she walked past her side. They were trying to force her to be an honorary knight.</p>
<p>But these guys were still in the middle of a battle against the giant antidemons, right? Did they know what Fran was capable of?</p>
<p>No, she was clearly back at least halfway through. In addition, there was a hint of fear in her eyes that could be seen through the gap in the helter.</p>
<p>They must have disobeyed my orders. Even after looking at it this way, I didn’t want to be an honor knight. Because I was honored to be on the line with the holy knights, right? So, it was less than the shitty ones who were giving us the parchment right now. Although their title was flashy, they were practically only one of the knights that were kept in Silard.</p>
<p>Fran released her aura of intimidation lightly and glared at the holy knights. That alone paved the way, allowing Fran to continue going by herself.</p>
<p>For Fran, who had grown even further through the fierce battles, this was not the only opponent she had. She seemed to be one of the few holy knights in the world.</p>
<p>Still, he was a magician who tried to chase Fran after her when she died, but a new figure blocked the way.</p>
<p>「Wait! Hey,――」</p>
<p>「What kind of commotion is this?」</p>
<p>「Y-You’re......」</p>
<p>「Sophie!」</p>
<p>Sophie――or rather, Sophilia, the saintess. We’ve had her rescue many times, and I won’t call her “eaten and run” anymore.</p>
<p>「You failed because of Mea and me, so you’re next, Fran?」</p>
<p>「...It has nothing to do with you」</p>
<p>「Hehe. I lifted you up to the point that you’re a saintess, and then I called you if you refused to recruit. I know the level of your country, you know?」</p>
<p>「You want to make fun of our country!」</p>
<p>「Silard isn’t making fun of us. He’s making fun of you guys. But I wonder if he really has anything to do with these idiots?」</p>
<p>「Girl, come here.」</p>
<p>「That’s all I can say?」</p>
<p>What a fierce fight! Apparently, the Holy Nation angered Sophie and broke the negotiations. While Silard’s men were angry, Sophie’s emanating anger was nothing short of intimidating a puppy.</p>
<p>What can I do to piss Sophie like this?</p>
<p>I wondered what should we do now? I thought they would be a reliable reinforcement, but at this rate, they might start killing each other. We won’t be able to settle this.</p>
<p>But then someone else appeared.</p>
<p>「What’s the commotion? You might get in the way of the inn.」</p>
<p>「You are......」</p>
<p>「Are you guys from another country? Are you from a big country, but you’re a little rude?」</p>
<p>「That emblem! The Kingdom of Segilusel!」</p>
<p>「My name is Yagilale, Captain of the Third Knight Order. Do you know him?」</p>
<p>「Guh...」</p>
<p>That was Yagilale. They must have been able to return to Nocta in one piece.</p>
<p>「It’s not been so long――but I feel like we haven’t seen each other for days」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>In front of Yagilale’s gentle expression, the people of the Holy Nation fell silent as if in a daze. They said it was the Kingdom of Knights, but I wonder if they were from a country that big?</p>
<p>「That piece of parchment, isn’t it quite something? It’s a kind of evil law that is forbidden in our country. Is that something that is still used in the Holy Nation?」</p>
<p>At Yagilale’s tongue, Silard’s people were clearly on the run. Or rather, they fled.</p>
<p>「I-I don’t know what you’re saying. Well, there was a commotion here, so let’s leave it for today」</p>
<p>「I-I’ll ask you to talk again when things have calmed down. So, please leave some time for now」</p>
<p>「Please wait without leaving」</p>
<p>Who the hell were they? They seemed to be asking for this, and it seemed that this was practically an order from them. Fran must have gotten tired of it too.</p>
<p>「Yeah. I won’t be talking to you anymore.」</p>
<p>「Kuh......!」</p>
<p>The magicians looked angry again, probably not used to having their requests refused. But in addition to Sophie and Yagilale, they noticed Mea and Zelos Reed’s appearance.</p>
<p>They quickly ran away.</p>
<p>「Thank you. Thank you.」</p>
<p>「No, no. I’m sure you wouldn’t have had any problems. I’m sorry」</p>
<p>「It was a disaster, huh? I was so persistent too. They told me I would accept the people of Nocta as slaves under the terms of the solicitation! What do you think I was doing!?」</p>
<p>「Fuahaha! You too! I have a similar solicitation! Thanks to you, I will accept the beastmen as slaves to the Holy Nation!」</p>
<p>They still didn’t know Mea’s background yet? Maybe this made the Holy Nation of Silard an enemy of the Beast Kingdom.</p>
<p>「Well, it can’t be helped. We’re in a great hurry after losing the Divine Sword Knight」</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>Mea-san! A few bombs!</p>
