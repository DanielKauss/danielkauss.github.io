</div><h1>Chapter 989</h1><p>「Balfon-sama! I have brought the Southern Duke, Sigulard-sama!」</p>
<p>「Inhabited」</p>
<p>「Buhohoho. It’s been a long time since I’ve had the Eastern Duke」</p>
<p>「Kishi, well done in the south」</p>
<p>「You came all the way here to come and what are you doing for him? About the Western Duke’s movements?」</p>
<p>「What happened to the west?」</p>
<p>「Having almost Seedran in our hands, we should have acquired a water dragonkin. With this, our control over the sea is almost over. We need to finalize the plan, right?」</p>
<p> We must have the final meeting of the plan, right?」</p>
<p>「Kishi.  That’s another time.  It’s still too hard for both the south and me to say that they’re ready. Right?」</p>
<p>「So you mean the flies from that timeline?」</p>
<p>「A flies?  Who are they? The red knights?」</p>
<p>「No.  They’re from a strangely strong old man and the half-insect mercenary group. They sometimes refuse to use force while trying to get their friends free.」</p>
<p>「The southern territory seems to be filled with a lot of things, you know?  Kishishishi」</p>
<p>「Bufun.  They appear out of nowhere, so there are always collaborators in their territory. </p>
<p>「Bufh.  I don’t need any more help.  Anyway, you’re a creepy, artificially-made superhuman being, right? How can we create forces that we can’t control?」</p>
<p>「I got some good data in Gordicia, like Kranzel, Seedran, and Belioth.  The true completion of my research is approaching! Besides, most of your undead are creepy!」</p>
<p>「No one army is as easy to use as the undead, you know?  Without any words, no complaints, and no complaints, they keep moving forever as long as their magic continues.  Besides, the cost of burying them rises.  Bufopho! This is just the way it works!」</p>
<p>「You’re saying something as if it’s the west, right?」</p>
<p>「Bfun!  It’s better than the guardians!」</p>
<p>「Besides, are you sure you don’t have any complaints?  No, you’re not.」</p>
<p>「As for them, they’re still the same as the other immortals after all. I’m bound by contract!」</p>
<p>「You said Nameless?  I don’t think you can bind them with a contract?」</p>
<p>「Bwahaha!  It’s a new kind of technique, so don’t waste any documents on the floating island.」</p>
<p>「Oh?  That’s interesting to hear.」</p>
<p>「Besides, the saintess they revere revered is in their hands. I can’t disagree with it even without a contract」</p>
<p>「Shishishi. Wasn’t it a special kind of undead that was the mother of the rational undead?」</p>
<p>「Indeed.  The only undead in the world who gave birth to children. Oh, and also the mother of Sibylla, the red sword.」</p>
<p>「Sibylla!  Shishi!  That’s good!  I’m literally a superhuman!  It hurts to destroy the laboratory. Well, I’m glad we pulled up the data though.」</p>
<p>「Bfun...... It’s because I was in my territory that the research is still considered to be led by me, you know?」</p>
<p>「I’m sorry about that. But it was just a joint research, so it can’t be helped, right?」</p>
<p>「You’d better not be resented by the red knights.  Besides, the Knights of the Red Sword had many survivors from the laboratory. In that case, it’s gonna be too long, I guess?」</p>
<p>「Buffuh, the dog of the Chancellor!  They were after us for an invasion of Alessa, but...... We’ll start by settling the territory!」</p>
<p>「Kisshi. I’ll be counting on you at any moment, okay?」</p>
<p>「I’ll have to destroy them as soon as possible for the sake of that plan.  So?  Why did you call them so careless? I don’t have any time to waste, you know?」</p>
<p>「The reason why I called you was because of the Discarded Divine Sword of Gordicia that you had asked me to do.」</p>
<p>「You’ve made progress!  The undead are not allowed to enter that continent. </p>
<p>「No.」</p>
<p>「Buf? But the story is about the Discarded Divine Sword, right?」</p>
<p>「Yeah.  Although it was about the Discarded Divine Sword, there has been no progress. No, if things had progressed, I think things might have progressed」</p>
<p>「...What happened?」</p>
<p>「First, it was the Golden Devourer Sword, Overgrowth, but it’s been destroyed.」</p>
<p>「W-What the hell!  Even though it’s not even a divine sword, it’s a failed divine sword!  Moreover, it has accumulated power over the years!  Has it been destroyed? How stupid......!」</p>
<p>「The truth. Something happened to the adventurer’s woman, who was the current wielder, and she was probably destroyed in the middle of her battle against high-ranking antidemons.」</p>
<p>「Isn’t that adventurer lying?」</p>
<p>「Half of her antidemonized body has returned to its original state, and there is no sign of her divine sword. There’s no doubt about it.」</p>
<p>「Following Ebill Eater and even Overgrowth...  So, the only Discarded Divine Sword left is a falldown?」</p>
<p>「That’s right. But there were also problems with that too」</p>
<p>「What?」</p>
<p>「Everyone who had infiltrated has lost their consciousness」</p>
<p>「Wha! Then can’t we still follow the falldown!?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, this is one of my faults. I’ll apologize.  I’m sorry.」</p>
<p>「Sorry for the trouble! </p>
<p>「I’ve always wanted data on the Discarded Divine Sword.  The same frustration came to my mind. </p>
<p>「Were they building a relationship with the wielder?」</p>
<p>「Indeed.  Was that little girl aware of my intentions? </p>
<p>「Bufun.  Something’s not going well.」</p>
<p>「Yeah, we’re not gonna go well.  Anyways, we’ll have the people in Gordicia move on to find out what’s going on. We’re waiting for that information」</p>
<p>「... It can’t be helped, so hurry up as much as possible, okay?」</p>
<p>「I know.  Besides, I’ve gathered a lot of information about the Divine Sword. I’ll give you the documents later.」</p>
<p>「Oh?  I’m looking forward to it.  Well then, I’ll also give you a report on our investigation. First, can I tell you about the King’s behavior?」</p>
<p>「Wh-what’s wrong, he’s doing his job, right?」</p>
<p>「Of course.  Well, the King is still the same as before.  He leaves his political work to the Chancellor, learning every day. Hmph, he’s a good person, isn’t he?」</p>
<p>「He’s the King, so I know.  I have no intention of disobeying him.  But I don’t know the Chancellor, so I’ll have to eliminate him eventually. He’s still moving behind the scenes, just like last time.」</p>
<p>「Okay, shishi!  I agree!  I can pretend to be close to other countries! </p>
<p>「Bufun, that’s right.  And it’s the Northern Duke, who might be the biggest obstacle for us...... I still don’t know what will happen to the Northern Duke.」</p>
<p>「I can’t predict what will happen to the Northern Duke.」</p>
<p>「Indeed, but they will not be our enemies.」</p>
<p>「Kisshi!  If it ever comes to the Northern Knights, it’s the strongest group I’ve ever heard of!  How can I get so many powerful knights...... I’d like to hear their secret」</p>
<p>「Buffu, you’ve heard that, haven’t you?  If you keep reaping the magic beasts from morning till night for the rest of your life, anyone will become stronger. I heard that too.」</p>
<p>「Kissshishishi! They’re even crazier than me!」</p>
<p>「Okay.  The treasure sword in your hand is terrifyingly strong too.  It would be impossible to defeat any of the northern plains. Even I’m stupid to even try it」</p>
<p>「Yes.  Even so, in the north, Sibylla of the red sword, Shuzekka of the scarlet eye, Weena Rhyn of the high elves, Jean of the necromancer, and the demon knights directly under Diaz. All of them are troublesome inside and outside」</p>
<p> In the south.</p>
<p>「I’m looking forward to it then」</p>
