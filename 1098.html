</div><h1>Chapter 1098</h1><p>A scream from a servant woman in </p>
<p>「Kyaaaaa!」</p>
<p> would echo through the mansion. Now all of our intrusions have been exposed, but it’s okay. In the first place, Esmeralda was told to be flashy. The nobles of the Ashtner group were proud that they could not afford to take any strict punishment anyway, because they were in a national crisis. They had been underestimating them so far, but if they get into a fight any more, they are aiming to warn them that they will crush them. They’ve been taking a heavy hit so far, but their goal was to warn them that if they get into a fight any further, they would be crushed. That’s why they didn’t use the barrier to silence them, and even when we stepped in, they were talking proudly in front of the gate.  </p>
<p>「W-What are you―― Ugh!」</p>
<p>『I-I’m merciless』</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p> Fran gets electrocuted to knock the servants out. Well, I wonder if it’ll be okay if she won’t kill someone she’s recognized as an enemy?  Blue seems to be heading to her office where she thinks the Viscount is.  So we’ll try to give him a particularly strong presence in this mansion. It’s not the room where the Viscount is supposed to be, but the basement.  We ran through the mansion, knocking out servants and soldiers.  Finally, we found a staircase to the basement at the back of the mansion. But when we went down, we found no one there.  Well, it was obvious though. </p>
<p>「Hah!」</p>
<p>  Fran kicked the wall on her right, and a large hole opened to reveal the existence of the hidden room. There, four people were hiding.  </p>
<p>『They’re Viscounts!』</p>
<p>  Apparently, they were hiding here. Did they just use their presence to get away from here?  </p>
<p>『Fran, there’s some paperwork in this room. We want to get those as soon as possible, so we’ll take them over with as little damage as possible.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>  Fran nodded and already took down the knight in a single punch. He may not be the strongest person in this mansion, but he’s not Fran’s enemy. Then she beat up the Viscount with my telekinesis, and Fran sank a son who looked like an orc with a head-on collision.  The paperwork was their ledgers and trade records of illegal goods.  The real thing came out.  However, there was no illegal slaves. Apparently, she just lent her name so that Marquis Ashtner could not stand out.  </p>
<p>『Besides, Raidos wasn’t a stealthy mansion either』</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p> She didn’t seem to have escaped from the mansion, and she was probably not a secret agent from the beginning. After that, Fran and the others went through the nobleman’s mansions under Marquis Ashtner and captured them one after another.  They’ve already crushed five of their families.  At their first house, they probably learned that someone important would escape to the basement.  Fran first searched the basement and stomped down there.  Well, she didn’t get any hits other than at the beginning though. Still, she had managed to find many things, including hidden ledgers and illegal slaves.  Fran was looking for illegal slaves, in particular.  With the detection of illegal slaves in the second house, her main goal was to rescue them. She probably thought it was best to leave the nobles to the soldiers.  </p>
<p>「It’s okay now, so...」</p>
<p>「Y-yes」</p>
<p>「Do you want to eat this?」</p>
<p>  They let her eat the curry. From Fran’s point of view, she was the most concerned about them.  As if in direct contrast to their kindness to the slaves, it rained blood in the mansion where they had been hidden. I didn’t kill them just in case because we had to get the information out of them, but the situation was quite miserable. This must be the situation that Esmeralda was aiming for.  The sixth house was very obedient.  Apparently, the other troops were also steadily conquering the mansion, and more than ten families had already been clamped down on the royal capital.  The story has already spread. They thought it would be better to get thrown in jail rather than get into a bad fight.  Just as Fran and her friends were about to head for their next mansion.  </p>
<p>「Please wait. Esmeralda-sama has contacted us」</p>
<p>「You contacted me?  When?」</p>
<p>「Now」</p>
<p>  Blue said so, but she didn’t seem to be wearing any magic tools for communication.  Fran looked tilted her head as well.  Then Blue held out something in her hand.  It was filled with a small lump of sand.  </p>
<p>「What is this?」</p>
<p>「It’s Esmeralda-sama’s sand.  It is through this that we can have a conversation. On the contrary, we can even see from a distance」</p>
<p>  I guess that was the reason why the Esmeralda of the group was called the sand communication network. They scattered sand over a wide area, allowing them to monitor and communicate with each other. In fact, it may be better for them to stay still to concentrate on the control of the sand.  When Blue handed him the sand, Fran conveyed Esmeralda’s voice to me as well. It seems that it was not a telepathy, but a bone- conduction method of talking that vibrated the sand.  </p>
<p>『Derick got some information from the man. We got a nobleman’s name out of that list, so can you head there?』</p>
<p>「Did you let Dirk talk to you already?」</p>
<p>  It’s still a few hours since I left Dirk with you, right? I thought she might have helped Satia, but that doesn’t seem to be the case.  </p>
<p>『Hiyaahaha.  I’ve been living for a long time, so I know a lot of things.  That man may have been in pain and drug training, but not so much in the pleasures. Hyaaaaha!』</p>
<p>  I didn’t know the details, but it seemed that he had tortured himself in a completely different way than normal. The dark chief must have a lot of bad knowledge.  Esmeralda was instructed to go to a Baron’s mansion where Blue was said to be completely unmarked. Baron Noare was a plain and poor nobleman.  He had such a low presence that he never suspected anyone before.  That must be what makes him connected to Raidos. He had nothing to do with Marquis Ashtner, and was probably acting together in case of emergency.  The mansion stood quietly at the end of the nobility that was causing a lot of trouble in various places. Because of the shadow of the royal castle, it was really a dark corner.  </p>
<p>「Here?」</p>
<p>「Yes.Blue was also confused.  She really felt like a poor and low-ranking nobleman’s mansion and didn’t even have a gatekeeper.  The walls were collapsed and the gardens were not well-kept.  It was hard to believe she was hiding her stealth skills.  Even so, Fran’s face was filled with motivation.  I could feel some kind of presence, albeit faint.  I didn’t know who it was, but I was pretty sure that there was someone with stealth skills. Quite a few wielders would say that they didn’t know the exact location at this distance.  </p>
<p>『Urushi, we’ll count on you to track them down if push comes to shove』</p>
<p>(Woof woof!)</p>
<p> Urushi, who was not very active in the royal capital, looked motivated. It seemed that his opponent was specialized in stealth, and there was a possibility that he could escape.  We pushed open the gate ourselves and patted the door to the mansion.  I guess the reason why he was so violent was to intimidate us.  After waiting for a while, a maid appeared from the mansion. She was a maid who seemed to have a bit of a smug vibe and a naive attitude.  </p>
<p>「W-What is she doing?」</p>
<p>「I’ve heard a report that a spy from an enemy country has escaped to this area.  Let me find out what’s going on inside」</p>
<p>「Eh? Eeh?」</p>
<p>  We were listening to the exchange between Count Bailleys and the maid, who still disguised as a soldier, but this person really didn’t seem to know anything.  However, I was approaching and convinced. There was definitely something there somewhere in the mansion.  </p>
<p>「Where do you go?」</p>
<p>「W-wait a minute!」</p>
<p>「I won’t wait」</p>
<p>  Fran pushed the maid into the mansion.  I wonder if the one who was wearing a confused expression as she came out from the back was the Baron himself? Fran asked him a direct question.  </p>
<p>「Where is Raydoss’s stealth agent?」</p>
<p>「W-What is he doing......?  What in the world is he doing?  How could there be no Raydoss stealth agent, right?」</p>
<p>『No lies.』</p>
<p> Aside from the maid, Baron seemed to know about him. Fran pointed me at him.  </p>
<p>「I know I’m here.  If you show me not to lie, I might be able to avoid death.」</p>
<p>「B-How rude!  Even though I’m a poor Baronial family, my family is still a noble――Gyaaah!」</p>
<p>「We’re ordered by the government, so it doesn’t matter if we’re a noble or not.」</p>
<p>  Aah, since we’re friends with Raydoss, we’ve recognized him as an enemy.  He’s always at the top of his gear from the start.</p>
<p>「I’ll ask you one more time.</p>
<p>「I’ll ask you one more time. Where is Raydoss’s stealth agent?」</p>
