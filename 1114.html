</div><h1>Chapter 1114</h1><p>He hurriedly ran to the collapsed Klimut, who was bleeding profusely from his right eye. His eyes had complicated emblems on them that looked like magic circles.</p>
<p>It could not be healed by healing magic. It was different from the hard-to-curry wounds caused by evil spirits. It seemed that Klimt’s body didn’t seem to recognize the status of his eyeballs as abnormal. Even when I appraised Klimt, his status was normal.</p>
<p>「This eye can’t be healed by magic, you know...」</p>
<p>In a contract with a normal spirit, they form an equal relationship with each other through the lending of magic power. However, it seems that even a great spirit cannot be easily understood.</p>
<p>Until now, they had been forced to contain a raging Great-Spirit in a temporary contract. That was why they didn’t listen to her even when she summoned her, and Klimut was under a great burden.</p>
<p>She had changed this into a normal contract, and even wished for an equal relationship with a great spirit was evident in her words.</p>
<p>So, she managed to make a contract with him by giving him her right eye.</p>
<p>「Klimt, are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Kinda...... These eyes are a sign of a contract with the Great Spirit」</p>
<p>Klimt muttered something and smiled happily. To him, this was not something that he could easily accept as pessimism.</p>
<p>Besides, with the change to a decent contract, Klimut’s status had returned to normal. On the contrary, it seemed that some of it had been strengthened by the blessings of the spirits.</p>
<p>Indeed, when I appraised him to check his condition, I was surprised by his tremendous status.</p>

<p>He looked very strong.</p>
<p>It seemed that she was able to use Spirit Magic as before, and in exchange, she had gained powerful power. Moreover, she was also connected to the Great Spirit, which could even be an object of faith for an elf.</p>
<p>For a spirit caster, it would be cheap to make a contract with a great spirit with only their right eye.</p>
<p>I noticed that the blood flowing from Klimut’s right eye had stopped. The wound on his eyeball had also blocked. However, he seemed to have lost his vision.</p>
<p>I’m worried, but Klimt looks even more energetic than before. Klimt stopped Fran when she was about to go rescue the survivors, thinking that this would be very reassuring.</p>
<p>「Fran-san, is that sword okay?」</p>
<p>The sword that had been so evil must have made her realize that it was no ordinary sword.</p>
<p>「Nn, I’m fine」</p>
<p>「......Then I hope so.」</p>
<p>She didn’t seem to be convinced, but for now, she believed Fran’s words. I gave Fran another order to rescue her, and then she began to use spirit magic herself.</p>
<p>『Let’s just call Urushi for now』</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
<p>As I handed the captives over to Urushi and the others, Fran asked them about the mysterious object that had flew out of the Great Spirit. Because I couldn’t decide if I should retrieve it or just leave it alone.</p>
<p>However, Klimt was not well aware of that either. There was a strong possibility that it was a magic tool or something that was used in the ritual when he was summoned in the past.</p>
<p>Since the Great Spirit seemed to be concerned, we were asked to retrieve it just in case and we turned in the direction it had fallen. Then we caught a suspicious presence. The faint magic power was moving in a straight line toward the north. It was too suspicious. I followed it from above and found an undead running on the ground. There was something thin in its hand.</p>
<p>(Hydman.)</p>
<p>『I knew it, it was still there!』</p>
<p>It seems that Hydman was the first one to recover it. However, because of this, they had been discovered by us. Even though he had managed to erase his presence, he had not been able to erase the magic power of the mysterious object in his hand.</p>
<p>After observing from the sky for a while, he seemed to be trying to put the mysterious stick in an item bag. However, it seemed that he couldn’t put it in his bag.</p>
<p>Was it a special magic tool that couldn’t be found in an item bag? Well, it was actually something from the Great Spirit, so maybe it had some kind of hidden power.</p>
<p>In the first place, the fact that Hydman was trying to recover it also showed its uniqueness. In the first place, it was likely that his ultimate purpose was that mysterious stick instead of trying to deal with Klimt.</p>
<p>(I’ll take him down and get his stick back.)</p>
<p>『Yeah.』</p>
<p>We wanted to let him swim and see where he was going, but this would make him go to Raydoss. Besides, Klimut alone would not be enough to help us in the town.</p>
<p>That’s how much Fran thought about it when she decided to take down Hydman here. She hadn’t noticed us yet, and the combat power of that one was low. It was a complete victory with a slash from teleportation.</p>
<p>Hydeman’s legs were cut off and collapsed.</p>
<p>「G-Girl......!」</p>
<p>「What was your purpose for this?」</p>
<p>「Hmm? What are you talking about? I don’t know. I failed to kill the spirit user, so I was just thinking about recovering it」</p>
<p>「You mean Klimt’s assassination attack?」</p>
<p>「No! No further questions asked!」</p>
<p>So, I defeated it to try to activate the self-destruction device, but I now understand a lot by the Principle of Falsehood, didn’t I? Apparently, Hydman had been aiming for this stick-like sword from the beginning. I was sure that it would be recovered by us, so he must have tried to capture the false information before the self-destruct.</p>
<p>I appraised the mysterious stick lying on the ground and showed it as an old stick sword. A stick sword is a sword-like sword without a blade. At first glance, it looked like a thin sword in a scabbard, but in reality, it did not even have a blade.</p>
<p>Moreover, it had almost no decoration, only practicality. The metal cylinders were the only parts of the rods.</p>
<p>My attack power was 100 and the conductivity was D. There was no doubt that it had the skills for hardening and repair to put a lot of emphasis on toughness... But it was just a little strange.</p>
<p>Even if it didn’t land a direct hit, if it had been repelled by that momentum, it would have been a considerable impact. Moreover, it had fallen into the ground at a considerable pace.</p>
<p>There was no way a weapon of this level could be left unscathed. In fact, it was strange that it had not been shattered to such an extent that it could not be repaired.</p>
<p>Or was it because she was trying to increase her ability to cure and repair even at the expense of her performance? Moreover, she did not get into the dimensional storage. Because of the force of the backlash, she couldn’t store it no matter how I tried.</p>
<p>Is it because the information displayed and the power it felt were not the same as the real thing? There seemed to be a secret that Hydman was aiming for.</p>
<p>「I’ll deliver it to Klimut for now」</p>
<p>『Yeah.』</p>
