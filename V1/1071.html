</div><h1>Chapter 1071</h1><p>After I judged that I couldn’t easily defeat the demon, I transformed my decorative cord and stretched it out toward Fran. Capture my main body and shut it up!</p>
<p>Urushi was on his way to Satya.</p>
<p>(Master!)</p>
<p>『I’m not gonna kill him!』</p>
<p>(...I’m sorry.)</p>
<p>Fran must be frustrated at not being able to cook for herself. But I was even happy. It was a natural feeling for a person that they didn’t want to slash or fight because they were friends.</p>
<p>Just looking at it from the battle standpoint, it might be said that it has weakened, but I’m sure it has grown.</p>
<p>Besides, she was my partner in times like this.</p>
<p>『I can do what Fran can’t do. On the other hand, if I can’t, Fran can help me』</p>
<p>(Nn. Got it.)</p>
<p>Fran nodded and slashed at him. I guess he intended to block the demon’s movement and support me.</p>
<p>「Guys, get as far away from me as possible!」</p>
<p>Hearing Fran’s words, the villagers began to leave the scene on their own. However, the square was surrounded by wooden barriers and the men’s legs were restrained. It would be impossible to go far away. Still, it made it easier to fight just by getting away from them.</p>
<p>The Sword God Transformation had already been broken, and I hadn’t used Divine Energy Manipulation or Evil Conquest. But Fran had overwhelmed him.</p>
<p>I evade the scythes, cut through invisible telekinesis, and cut through the huge body of the demon. The regeneration inhibition doesn’t work, so it quickly regenerates, but I still can’t move while my legs are regenerating. It gives me the feeling of being able to relax, as if I’m giving a subordinate guidance.</p>
<p>And then, without the support of the demons, my steel threads rushed to Fran.</p>
<p>「Damn!」</p>
<p>He tried to escape, but Fran’s own status was not that great. Although her level was higher than it used to be, she was probably just a low-ranked adventurer.</p>
<p>My ability was also focused on the skill of manipulating demons. My steel threads then entangled around Fran’s limbs to seal her movements.</p>
<p>It seems that Pune wanted to somehow go help Fran, but Fran won’t let her. Using the blessing of the Beast and Insect Gods, she sometimes unleashes attacks clothed in the divine attribute.</p>
<p>As I’d thought, the Divine Attribute seemed to be effective against the demons too. There were still unregenerated wounds on Bunen.</p>
<p>As a result, Pune was unable to carelessly show any openings. As soon as she showed her back, she might be hit with a non-regenerating blow to her vital point.</p>
<p>『Sleep!』</p>
<p>「Gugaaah!」</p>
<p>I hit him with an electric shock while making Fran duck with steel threads. I was going to paralyze him to block his movements.</p>
<p>However, Fran was not paralyzed. When I paid closer attention, I saw that black magic power was overflowing around her body. It seemed that she had herself possessed a demon, just like a demon knight.</p>
<p>It seems that other than Bune, the demons were also following me. They had high levels of magical and abnormal status resistance due to their racial characteristics. That’s probably what allowed them to block my thunder magic. Will I increase my power output? But they might kill me if I overdo it.</p>
<p>Urushi seemed to feel the same way, and was unable to restrain them easily. Dark magic had been canceled.</p>
<p>However, I didn’t mention Ronoue at all. To my surprise, he’s been hit by the poison mist. It seems that the combination of Poison Nullification and Predatory Assimilation skills allowed him to eat the poisoned Ronowe. That’s why I couldn’t poison it unwittingly and I could see him attacking with tentacles. But Urushi has the advantage when it comes to fighting physically.</p>
<p>That should allow me to concentrate on what I’m doing.</p>
<p>『How about this!』</p>
<p>I used my Magic Steal and Magic Absorption skills to the best of my ability. With this, I could suck up all the magic power of the demon and defeat it.</p>
<p>I could see that Fran’s magic power was rapidly diminishing. Not only was it being sucked by me, it was also putting a lot of effort into defending against electric shocks. If things continued like this, the magic exhaustion might even knock her out of her consciousness.</p>
<p>But Fran could not do it for free. She must have realized that she would be captured without doing anything.</p>
<p>I was born several decades ago, it seems. Not that it means much to me considering how I don’t remember living that long myself.</p>
<p>「I offer you my mana......! Possess me! Buneneeh! Gughaaaah!」</p>
<p>『This is...!』</p>
<p>「Urooourgh!」</p>
<p>When he thought that Fran’s figure had disappeared, his appearance changed drastically. His skin turned brown, and his hair turned white as if he had lost its color. His eyes had turned into gold, and mysterious red patterns appeared on his arms and face.</p>
<p>Fran’s figure then sank into the shadows and appeared a little farther away from us. She used Shadow Transfer.</p>
<p>「Haha... Fran, don’t lose! But I won’t lose! That’s right! I won’t lose!」</p>
<p>Fran roared silently as she rushed in. The speed she had in the past was unbelievable compared to her speed in the past.</p>
<p>With that momentum, he slammed the handle of the scythe on his right hand. It was probably the same size as the jet-black scythe that Pune had. It was very small because it was Fult’s size, but the power was stronger than it was now.</p>
<p>He seemed to be stronger in his possession than in his summoned state.</p>
<p>「Uwooooh!」</p>
<p>「Muh!」</p>
<p>『I’m gonna increase the power of my telekinesis! But it’s not enough to block it. Leave this to me!』</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
<p>「Impossible...」</p>
<p>Fran was surprised. She must have thought that she could win if she had Bune in her possession. But that was not enough. If it had been Fran at the time we first met, she might have certainly lost.</p>
<p>But now that we’ve seen the hell in Gordicia, we can’t get close enough! Fran still didn’t get a scratch on her.</p>
<p>I thought about continuing to break my limbs and neutralize it, but there was something wrong behind that.</p>
<p>「Kyain!」</p>
<p>Urushi was flicked away by countless tentacles and flew through the air.</p>
<p>Satya was already fused with Ronowe. His first attack was called Summoning, while Fran’s status was Possessing. Then the first demon knight and the current Satya status was probably called Appraisal.</p>
<p>「Ahahahaha! It’s a beast that’s against me! Let’s just make it stuffed!」</p>
<p>「Grrr...」</p>
<p>But it wasn’t Satya, Ronowe’s words were released from her mouth.</p>
