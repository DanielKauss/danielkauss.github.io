</div><h1>Chapter 1072</h1><p>I borrowed Satya’s body to reveal Ronowe. The magic power radiating from her body was overwhelming. She was probably much stronger than the demons we fought in Alessa’s goblin dungeon before.</p>
<p>It seems that the most important thing for the Demon Lord was to be able to draw out the true power of the Evil God. And yet, the fact that you didn’t use it very often shows that you were exhausted...</p>
<p>「I’ll erase this whole village! I’ll sacrifice you and make you disappear!」</p>
<p>Even if it’s because of its weakness in terms of fuel consumption and exhaustion, that doesn’t do much to me in such a short fight!</p>
<p>The demon Ronowe shouted, turning his entire body into hundreds of tentacles. He thought the demon’s body exploded and attacked the villagers with countless tentacles.</p>
<p>At this rate, the men, women, mother, and children, as well as the villagers, would be annihilated. It is impossible to prevent everything!</p>
<p>Fran must have sensed the danger just as I thought she would.</p>
<p>Hesitating for a moment. However, Fran immediately turned away from her confusion and stepped forward.</p>
<p>Fran and Satia were friends, and the people in this village were the first time we had met before. So, if they were to prioritize getting along with their friends, they would abandon it and let it go.</p>
<p>Something must be going on. If we were to enemies here, we would not only lose our friends, but also make the Kingdom of Philias our enemy.</p>
<p>Still, Fran chose to help the villagers.</p>
<p>「Haaaaah!」</p>
<p>Turning into black lightning, Fran walked forward through the gap between the tentacles. The violently wriggling black mass at the base of the tentacles approached her in front of her.</p>
<p>Fran was probably in a similar state to when she slashed against Trismegistus in Gordicia. Perhaps she unconsciously mastered the blessings of the Beast and Insect Gods, or maybe, Fran herself radiated a Divine Attribute for now.</p>
<p>What emerged from there was a slash at a divine speed, similar to Heaven Judgement. It was not flashy. However, my blade was definitely slashing at the amorphous Ronowe.</p>
<p>The mass of black was split into two letters.</p>
<p>At the same time, I could see that her mind and magic power within her had also taken damage. I was somewhat convinced that she had cut through an invisible part of her body.</p>
<p>「Kyaaaaaah!」</p>
<p>Ronoue let out a high-pitched scream like an echo. And at the same time, countless tentacles returned to their main body as if the stretched gum had returned to its original state.</p>
<p>「D-Don’t aim your intimidation at me, fucking puppy!」</p>
<p>Now that she had regained her human form, Ronowe shouted in agony while holding back the area around her side.</p>
<p>A large amount of magic power leaked out of the slow-to-regenerate wounds created by the divine attribute. However, there was still fierce hostility in her burning red eyes. She seemed to be unwilling to fight.</p>
<p>「Uwooogh!」</p>
<p>「I’ve already seen it through」</p>
<p>「Gyiiiii!」</p>
<p>When Ronowe’s arms transformed into thin tentacles, each of them attacked Fran with different movements. In addition, his hair suddenly expanded and became purple smoke. It was a all-round attack using tentacles and poison. If it had been released as it was, it would have caused damage not only to Fran but also to the villagers.</p>
<p>But Fran wouldn’t let him do that. The tentacles had been cut down by countless slashes, and the poison mist had been extinguished by my thunder magic.</p>
<p>「Aaaaaaah!」</p>
<p>Ronowe, who had lost both arms and her hair in tatters, let out a scream of resentment. As Ronowe looked at her, Fran raised her eyebrows sadly.</p>
<p>「I’m not going to forgive you! I’ll kill you! Die――Gyii! Shit shit shit!」</p>
<p>Ronoue’s face contorted with fury and shame. Then, as he was about to sprinkle poison again, I blocked him.</p>
<p>Ronoue had not given up yet. In order to stop him, we would have to cut him down. I could see that Fran had made up her mind. As usual, she had no intention of killing him. But it seemed that she was ready to inflict any wounds that would continue to remain.</p>
<p>「Sorry――」</p>
<p>「I won’t let you!」</p>
<p>She unleashed her slash with a pathetic look on her face. However, the blow was blocked by Fran’s scythe, which she intervened in time.</p>
<p>「Satya! Run away! You’ve overused the Manifestation skill! If things continue like this, you’ll die!」</p>
<p>「......But!」</p>
<p>She seemed to be still conscious as a caster even in her demonkin state. Fran tells Satya to run away. Satya herself doesn’t seem to have any intention of running away, but it was Ronowe who took charge of her body.</p>
<p>In order to protect his own life, the demon immediately turned away and began to run.</p>
<p>「Wait! Ronoweh! big brother!」</p>
<p>「Sorry about that Satya.」</p>
<p>「Frut, I won’t chase you if you want to escape.」</p>
<p>「That is a tall order! Using my life as bait, bring it to life! Duke of Demons!」</p>
<p>An overwhelming presence that even surpassed that of Ronowe appeared. Did she call it the Duke of Demon? She’s a Baron and a threat level of B, right? There must be a threat level of A in all likelihood.</p>
<p>It was a huge body over five meters long, and the head of a dragon. It had dragon wings on its back as well, making it look like a half-dragonkin. prince Fran must have been prepared to achieve his goal even if he killed her.</p>
<p>Just from the aftermath of the magic power released when it appeared, a huge explosion occurred as if it had just occurred. The villagers were blown away.</p>
<p>「Urushi, please!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Don’t get in your way!」</p>
<p>「Grrrr!」</p>
<p>Fran swapped places with Urushi and sent recovery magic to the villagers. Some of them were in quite dangerous condition, but it seemed that they made it in time. They were unconscious, but no one was dead.</p>
<p>There, a loud scream echoed again.</p>
<p>「Ghaaaaah!」</p>
<p>「Frut?」</p>
<p>When Fran turned around, she saw a small knife stuck on the back of Benet’s face against Urushi.</p>
<p>『Hey... Isn’t he a villager!?』</p>
<p>It was one of the villagers who threw it. It seems that a operative or something from Raydoss had hidden his abilities and blended in with the villagers.</p>
<p>As expected, they hadn’t appraised everyone individually. I hurriedly turned to look at her status with the Heavenly Eye skill at full power, and found that all the skills that spies needed were of a high rank, such as stealth, disguise, act, and lie. I couldn’t sense any killing intent when throwing a knife at her, so she must be quite talented.</p>
<p>I quickly unleashed my telekinesis, but the attacker dodged as if they could see, and then turned away.</p>
<p>『Urushi! Follow this man!』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>『Fran, let’s treat Fran!』</p>
<p>「Don’t let it get away!」</p>
<p>Fran tried to pull out the knife stuck in her back, but it seemed to have some kind of magical effect, so she could not pull it out.</p>
<p>「Guh...」</p>
<p>「Frut!」</p>
<p>「It’s no use. This is a sign of a demon killer...... I won’t be of any use to you anymore...」</p>
