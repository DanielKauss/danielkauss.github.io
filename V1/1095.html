</div><h1>Chapter 1095</h1><p>It seems Count Bailleys was also responsible for finding out if Satya had any conspiracies.</p>
<p>Half an hour after he left, Satya, who had been waiting in the reception room, was led to a different room again.</p>
<p>Fran was on standby. Since she was in an audience with King Kranzel, she couldn’t bring any escorts with her.</p>
<p>The royalty of Philias was known to use demon power, and they probably wanted to minimize their forces just in case. If Satya’s goal was to assassinate the king, we wouldn’t know what Fran would do.</p>
<p>The other thing they wanted to do next was to take advantage of the rest. Kranzel would like to form an ally with Philias, but they would also like to gain an advantage as much as possible.</p>
<p>For this reason, they must want to show to Satya that they are superior in status. Kranzel has a large number of people, including guards, and Satya only has one. That implies that they are in the position of both countries.</p>
<p>The relations between the countries were not just a friendly one, and this was also a negotiation.</p>
<p>Still, she had no intention of messing around, so Fran, who was waiting for her, was in an infinite tea and snacks party. She had replenished the food from the moment she ate.</p>
<p>She had already eaten dozens of high-quality sweets that were served at the royal palace, right? A few maids have changed their expressions at all, you know? If it had been me, I would have definitely made them scrunch up. All of them were expressionless. As expected of the servants of the royal castle. They were all professional.</p>
<p>However, it was Fran who changed her expression here. There was a slight hint of suspicion around the royal castle grounds.</p>
<p>We were so far away that we couldn’t follow her anymore. However, it was obvious that she was using skills or magic to disguise her presence.</p>
<p>(Enemy?)</p>
<p>『Hmmm. I don’t know. I can’t sense any hostility or malice at this distance』</p>
<p>I don’t know if he was an enemy spy or a dark side of the Kingdom of Kranzel. In the latter case, it would be better to make a scene.</p>
<p>We were not the only ones who reacted to this presence. Or did they react to Fran’s reaction? It was one of the maids we had been waiting for in the corner of the room.</p>
<p>Actually, they knew that she was much stronger than the other maids. She must be their guard and watchman. She then walked over to us with her left hand on her ear.</p>
<p>「You noticed that?」</p>
<p>「Outside the royal castle?」</p>
<p>「I knew it... It must be an amazing ability」</p>
<p>I was surprised to see that Fran sensed the presence of someone far away. But she quickly returned to her face and told Fran not to do anything.</p>
<p>「This person is handling the situation. He won’t be able to move now」</p>
<p>「...Okay」</p>
<p>The piercing in her left ear must be a communication-type magic tool. It seemed that she was checking the outside situation with that thing.</p>
<p>「What’s going on?」</p>
<p>「I still have the details, but there’s a high possibility that the one who disappeared with magic has entered the Royal Capital」</p>
<p>Was he a spy for the Raidos Kingdom? If they had allocated a lot of forces to the north, the security of the royal capital would have been lax. In anticipation of this, it would not be surprising if a spy were to be hidden in the royal capital.</p>
<p>Fran was a little pissed off. She was getting bored of it, I guess. But we couldn’t move around here on our own.</p>
<p>We’d have to wait for Satya, and if we do something weird in the royal castle, we’d be a criminal.</p>
<p>Another hour later, just as Fran’s stomach was starting to swell, Satya finally came back to us. Her expression suggested that the meeting with the King was not a bad response.</p>
<p>「Fran-san. You will be staying in the royal castle for me. Your escort request will also be completed here」</p>
<p>「Nn. Okay」</p>
<p>「Thank you, very much」</p>
<p>Satya bowed her head deeply. Remaining in the royal castle meant, in a sense, that she was a hostage. Her heart would not rest completely.</p>
<p>Still, Satya smiled. She seemed to have made up her mind.</p>
<p>「I’ll do my best to be a bridge between our countries」</p>
<p>Fran also encouraged Satia with a slight smile on her face. Then, she hugged her.</p>
<p>「Nn. Do your best. But don’t push yourself too hard」</p>
<p>「Yes」</p>
<p>「I’m coming to see you」</p>
<p>「Yes...!」</p>
<p>They hugged each other for a while.</p>
<p>We parted ways with Satya and headed for the Adventurers Guild. That was what I thought, but it seemed we still had some business to attend to. The maid told me to wait just a little longer.</p>
<p>Within a few minutes, a new figure appeared in the room where Satya had waved her hands many times before. It was a small, old woman riding on a strange object. Was that a sofa made of sand?</p>
<p>The old lady was wrinkled, and seemed to be weak not only from the outside but also from the presence. However, there was no way that she could be weak if she was manipulating dust magic on her own. She must be good at hiding her abilities.</p>
<p>She had a beautiful robe with greenish-white hair and embroidery with plant-tree patterns. Her hair ornaments and rings were also stylish, and she looked like a refined old lady.</p>
<p>However, his impression dissipated when he opened his mouth.</p>
<p>「Excuse me in this state. Are you Black Lightning Princess-san?」</p>
<p>His voice and tone were very polite.</p>
<p>「Nn. Who is that old lady?」</p>
<p>「Gyahahaha. I am Esmeralda, a pitiful and pitiful old hag who has been defeated by incompetent former subordinates who have lived a leisurely retirement life」</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>Well, it wouldn’t be surprising if she had retired based on her age, but what would such an old lady do for us here? When we were confused, the maidservant supplemented her.</p>
<p>「She was originally the one in charge of the intelligence department in the Kranzel Kingdom」</p>
<p>「It was more than twenty years ago. They pulled him out because Ashtner’s rebellion made him short on magic power.」</p>
<p>「I’m sorry, but in order to make up for the lost intelligence power, we need the help of Esmeralda-sama of the 『Summit』」</p>
<p>「Hmm. In the first place, I can’t let her cause a rebellion anymore. I told her to be careful with Ashtner when retiring. Well, she’s going to give her a lot of money from the country after all. But more importantly, Black Lightning Princess. I was actually asked by a job request」</p>
<p>「Request?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. I’d love to recruit people to our academy, but you shouldn’t be interested in working for him, right?」</p>
<p>「Nn. I’m an adventurer」</p>
<p>「Yeah. I like kids who have a strong will of their own. It’s not like I’m gonna serve the country. It’s just a lot of trouble. How many times have I wanted to go back to being an adventurer?」</p>
<p>「She was an adventurer?」</p>
<p>「Up to forty years ago. I was still a former Rank A adventurer.」</p>
<p>They were the same age as Gamudot and the others, but they were probably even older than those old men. At any rate, I could tell that this old lady was the one we never wanted to make enemies with.</p>
