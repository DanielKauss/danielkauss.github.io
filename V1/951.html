</div><h1>Chapter 951</h1><p>Fran heard from the Silver Lady about her Divine Sword.</p>
<p>Next to Alpha, Berserk, Ignis, Gaia, Crystalos, and Tempest were the warrior knights, Charlotte.</p>
<p>I have only a little bit of information about this. It’s in the shape of a commander’s staff and it seems to be able to summon and control large numbers of various metal golems.</p>
<p>「It was about 5,000 years ago that I last saw Charlotte. At that time, an adventurer known as the battalion used me」</p>
<p>「The battalion! I’ve heard of it! The youngest adventurer to become an S-Ranked adventurer!」</p>
<p>I’m sure he was an A-ranked adventurer at the age of ten, or an S-ranker at the age of fourteen. As expected of Fran, he remembered the name of a strong adventurer.</p>
<p>To think she was the wielder of the Divine Sword... In other words, the alias of the battalion was derived from the fact that she led the Golem Army?</p>
<p>「As far as I know, she was manipulating twelve different golems and defeating antidemons by herself.」</p>
<p>The sight of the silver-coloured golem firing rays and metal bullets was exactly what made it worthy of the title of the strongest army in the world.</p>
<p>Wait, they’re really just a part of the Dragon King Syndicate, aren’t they? I think they’re doing science fiction, not just fantasy.</p>
<p>「Judging by the rumors, he died on the continent of Capul.」</p>
<p>They didn’t seem to know the restrictions either. However, since they couldn’t find any signs of her eating, it was possible that her body was mutating in some way.</p>
<p>「Overgrowth, huh? That’s a lot of people.」</p>
<p>「And for the heavy price of the Golden Dragon Sword, Eldorado, it must have been a very heavy price」</p>
<p>「Eldrado...... Certainly, the Divine Sword that had already been destroyed」</p>
<p>「Oh yeah, I know. El Dorado was a Divine Sword in the shape of a golden knight spear. Its ability is to summon a Light Dragon and use it. It was a huge Light Dragon that, once it appeared, dyed the earth golden」</p>
<p>That must be a ability similar to that of a kin of Lindvlum. The difference between a fire dragon and a light dragon is that of an El Dorado.</p>
<p>「The price was the life expectancy of the wielder. I remember that the more you use it, the older you age, and the faster you die.」</p>
<p>『Uwah. That’s certainly too high a price.』</p>
<p>So there was a price higher than the level. But even so, a Divine Sword was a Divine Sword. It seemed that those who wanted to use it were disappointed.</p>
<p>Therefore, he had been using more than ten replacements while on this continent. The user limit seemed to have been a good match for the sword, but apparently, many of them could be used on this continent since there were many dragonkin.</p>
<p>I guess that meant that it had been spilled out of this continent and destroyed there afterwards.</p>
<p>「......Did you have to pay for the life expectancy of your lynch?」</p>
<p>「Lindvlm... It’s the Divine Sword used in the defense of Sendia.」</p>
<p>She had already seen that battle, so she immediately mentioned that information to him.</p>
<p>「Nn. My friend was using it」</p>
<p>In Mea’s case, Sophie had reached the Divine Sword Release, but it was no longer available for use again now. It would not be released for a while again. Therefore, Fran didn’t seem to be too concerned about Mea’s cost, but she was suddenly worried about it when she heard that her life expectancy might have been reduced.</p>
<p>「We don’t have any information on Lindvlm, so we’re not sure exactly. Do you know the authors of that Divine Sword?」</p>
<p>「Umm...?」</p>
<p>『Could it be, she’s a Divine level blacksmith named Fergo?』</p>
<p>That must have been what Lumina had shown us in the list.</p>
<p>「I see. Eldorado’s creator is Urushi. It seems that the cost will differ depending on the authors, so I don’t think the cost of Lyndovlem would be a long life span」</p>
<p>「Good」</p>
<p>Fran stroked her chest relievedly. But the fact that Eldrad’s creator was Ulmer meant that the price for Gaia and Ignis must be a long-lived being, right?</p>
<p>No, Isario showed no signs of aging after use, and even Ashwrath must have been using Gaia for quite a long time. I wonder if that was the case.</p>
<p>We don’t know exactly how long a demonkin’s life expectancy is, so we don’t know exactly how long they are. Besides, if Ashwrath’s life expectancy was a price to pay, Ashwrath would have intentionally used it up on purpose to commit suicide. So, the price must be at a level.</p>
<p>Two swords remained. Sanctuary, the Sanctuary, and Wisdom, the Wisdom Sword.</p>
<p>「These two rings have been observed only recently, you know?」</p>
<p>「Recently? So, they’re still on this continent?」</p>
<p>「Unfortunately, they have already disappeared. The Sanatorium was about seventy years ago. Wisdom was about twenty years ago, I suppose?」</p>
<p>Golems have been around for thousands of years, and have been treated these days or so.</p>
<p>「The Sanctuary was a rare Divine Sword in the form of armor. It had a main body of blue and white Kait Shields, and at the same time, it seemed to produce armor. It was capable of creating a Holy Area, where it could super-strengthen itself and its companions, and weaken its enemies. It was also likely to have an effect of granting a Shield King Skill. It was used by the Knight Commander of the Kingdom of Ilgistia」</p>
<p>It was a country I had never heard of before. Well, there are many continents and countries in this world. Of course, many countries do not know about it.</p>
<p>「What’s the cost?」</p>
<p>「The price of this Divine Sword is a little different from Wisdom’s, which I’ll explain later. I guess she’s a Divine level blacksmith too.」</p>
<p>「What’s the cost?」</p>
<p>「I don’t know if you could call it a price, but its power depends on the opponent」</p>
<p>Both Sanctuary and Wisdom were said to be set so that their capabilities would change depending on the strength of the opponent’s evil spirit. Perhaps the creator of this Divine Sword placed importance on the fact that they were weapons against the Evil Gods.</p>
<p>It is said that it was the largest force against Evil Gods, about a tenth against Evil People, and only a little stronger against Magic Beasts. It may be a little better against antidemons that contain evil energy.</p>
<p>The remaining Wisdom Sword’s abilities were still a little special. After it was released, it took the shape of multiple orbs floating in the air. And when it was released, it could use all kinds of magic. It could increase magic power, accelerate thought, and use magic at the same time.</p>
<p>The Divine Sword itself had no offensive power, but it was a Divine Sword that could be strong and weak by its user’s skill. If a magician could find its opponent’s weakness and instantly use its magic, it would become unrivaled strength.</p>
<p>However, she had never shown her true power on this continent, so even the Silver Lady had never seen her true power before.</p>
<p>Wisdom, like the Sanctuary, was a Divine Sword that could be used for healing and defense. I guess she was the same creator as me.</p>
