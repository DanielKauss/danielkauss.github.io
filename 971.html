</div><h1>Chapter 971</h1><p>We began our all-out attack on the giant-type, which had collapsed in a downcast state. </p>
<p>「Thor Hammer!」</p>
<p>『Kanna Kamui!』</p>
<p>「Uuoooh!」</p>
<p> My multiple Kanna Kamui and Fran’s magic rained down on the head of the giant. On its own, the upper half of the huge head, which was about the size of a small apartment building, was shattered, and a black mysterious substance overflowed instead of the brainplasm. Countless fire bullets rained down on the giant-type. Naturally, we were not the only ones who attacked it. Of course, we were not the only ones who attacked it.  Isario’s flames.  A rock spear that seemed to belong to you. After that, arrows and magic from the soldiers and adventurers were released.  Hundreds of attacks had been unleashed around the upper half of its body.  And this was not the end.  The old soldiers of the Hagane Kingdom gathered at several places, and a huge amount of magic power was emanating from each of the groups. It was a ritual magic that multiple people unleashed a single spell. After a long, minute-long chant, a number of huge lumps of flames were released, probably matching Isario.  They formed a large arc and more than ten lumps of flames landed on the giant-type. Rather than an explosion, it seemed to be more of a spell that kept burning with magic flames that did not disappear.  The upper half of the giant-type’s body was almost covered in flames.  Even so, it was not enough to defeat the giant antidemons.  It was damaged, but it was still alive.  </p>
<p>『Fran! Don’t let it get up!』</p>
<p>「Nn!  Urushi, do your right arm!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  Fran, who was holding me on her shoulder, gave Urushi an order. Urushi, who had run down from the sky, was running on a trajectory that almost grabbed the right arm of the giant.  His right wrist of the giant was deeply slashed by Fran, who had shaken me in full as we passed each other. It did not even cut me, but I had succeeded in interfering with its action.  The giant-type, which had put more power into its arms to stand up, collapsed again when one of its arms became unusable. Its huge body slammed into the ground again from her right shoulder.  </p>
<p>「Good grief, young miss!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p> The plan was to continue shaving away the giant-type with just one blow.  The giant-type tried to blow away everything in its vicinity by releasing magic power from its entire body, but it still did not lose the second unit. But even so, the second unit did not lose.  Fran, Isario, and the soldiers of the Hagane Kingdom had put up multiple barriers to prevent its magic release.  In the end, the second unit defeated the giant-type without damaging its entire body. In the end, Isario and I could only use all our magic.  The giant-type had its head burned and a hole was pierced in its chest. Finally, its huge body slowly fell apart as its regenerative power could not keep up with it.  The second unit, which had completely defeated the giant-type, continued to walk toward the collapsed town. There were no survivors.  This unit was only meant to defeat the giant-type.Rescuing, reconstruction, and cooking were the work of the other troops.  </p>
<p>「Kyaa, we might have to consider abandoning the town.」</p>
<p>「Is that so?」</p>
<p>「It will take a lot of time to rebuild.  It’s a precious safe area, but it’s difficult to use as a town right away. The residents are already annihilated.」</p>
<p>「...... Nn.」</p>
<p> The antidemons were still rampaging around, but there were no residents. Was there something in the town that attracted antidemons? Maybe there were survivors somewhere and were they being drawn to their mana? Isario and the others decided to scout it out and see if anything was unusual, focusing on the place where the giant-type first went on a rampage.  We searched for signs of the town from Urushi’s back as well.  And Fran and Urushi noticed something at the same time. A moment later, I could tell too.  </p>
<p>(Master, this is.)</p>
<p>『Yeah, evil.』</p>
<p>  I could sense a dense evil spirit from a corner of the ground.  It was the place that had collapsed when the giant-type stepped on it. A pile of rubble collapsed into a large hole, completely covered. I thought there were high-ranking antidemons inside, but the evil spirit position did not move at all.  </p>
<p>『Urushi, secure the guards and eliminate the antidemons here.』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>『We’ll take care of the rubble.』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  While carefully stowing the rubble away, we aimed for the bottom of the hole. As we moved halfway through, Fran pointed to a gap in the rubble under her feet.  </p>
<p>「Master, that...」</p>
<p>『There’s a purple light coming from below!』</p>
<p> The most similar thing was the glow of the evil crystal we saw the other day.  There might have been another Dragon King’s exploit here. And there was a possibility that there was an evil crystal below us.  Normally, the evil crystal must have been shattered by the crushing of the giant-type. However, maybe there were evil crystals that had entered the gaps between the rubble and could not be shattered miraculously. Anyway, we wanted to find out if they were really evil crystals.  We continued to excavate more of them, and without finding the evil crystals, we reached the bottom of the hole. It was probably originally an underground hall about 20 meters below ground level.  And there was something unexpected that emitted evil energy.  A huge magic circle was painted on the floor.  A dark purple light emitted magic circle and scattered dark evil energy around the area. No, we were able to find the evil crystal by further eliminating the rubble so that we could see the entire magic circle.  A small evil crystal was placed in the center of the magic circle.  It seemed that this evil crystal was providing power to the magic circle through the flow of magic power. Moreover, it didn’t seem to be just a device to pollute the surroundings with evil energy.  My golden skill reacted strangely.  This magic circle seemed to have some kind of effect on antidemons.  Judging from the behavior of the giantoids, it must have been effective in attracting antidemons. </p>
<p>『Let’s just store these evil crystals away for now.』</p>
<p>(We’ll also destroy the magic circle.)</p>
<p>『Right.』</p>
<p>  But there was something I was a little curious about.  </p>
<p>『There were a lot of evil crystals in the basement of Sendia, right?』</p>
<p>  And yet, there was only one small one here.  Wasn’t that small from the beginning?My Golden Style skill triggered a strange reaction. This magic circle seemed to have some kind of effect on the antidemons. Judging from the giant-type behavior, it must have been effective in attracting antidemons. </p>

<p> And yet, there was only one small one here. Wasn’t that small from the beginning? Or did someone else retrieve anything other than what was used to activate the magic circle?</p>
