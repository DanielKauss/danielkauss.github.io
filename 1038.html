</div><h1>Chapter 1038</h1><p>The skill “Permanent Loyalty”, which seemed to be a clue to me not going crazy. I didn’t want to use it as it is, because it had the effect of making me look like a slave to the Lord.</p>
<p>However, would Announcer-san be willing to help me to make it right? I don’t know if I can do it, and I always rely on her for this, but I’ll have to rely on that power for now.</p>
<p>That was an important step forward for us if we could stay together as Fran’s partner.</p>
<p>「A Divine Swordsman...... Could you be someone from the Kingdom of Philias?」</p>
<p>When I think of a Divine Sword controlling a demon, all I can think of is its name......</p>
<p>「No, that’s not it. I know of Diaz from Philias, but he looks different from that.」</p>
<p>So, does that mean that aside from Diaz, there is another Divine Sword capable of controlling demons?</p>
<p>「The wielder was a human man. As I said before, I don’t know the name of the wielder. However, I know the Divine Sword that he used. His wielder was the 『Grand Sword, Hell』, a Divine Sword that could control several kinds of poisons. However, it seemed that he had the ability to defeat a demon on his own and use its power」</p>
<p>Poison versus demon. Looks like they’re so close, that I can’t really understand the relationship between them. No, considering the name of this sword as a prison gate, it must be something like an ability to open a gate to hell.</p>
<p>I don’t know if there is a hell in this world. However, according to the legends of Earth, the demons are supposed to live in hell. Therefore, it would not be surprising if the prison sword could take advantage of the power of the demons.</p>
<p>「Her wielder was a gentle man with golden-silver eyes, blond hair, and dark skin, just like a male prostitute.」</p>
<p>「That’s it!」</p>
<p>Seliadot reacted to Trismegistus’ words. His eyes immediately sharpened as he shouted to Trismegistus.</p>
<p>「Where’s she now!?」</p>
<p>「I don’t know.」</p>
<p>Trismegistus’ attitude was not friendly, probably because he did not recognize Seliadot. But Seliadot was not afraid.</p>
<p>「Yeah, without a doubt! She’s the poison user who had killed my country!」</p>
<p>So this is her revenge, huh? A powerful poison user who has obeyed many illegal slaves. That’s why the lorelei will lose. To think she was a Divine Sword user after all.</p>
<p>「I have no clue what’s going on? Just my goal.」</p>
<p>「It seems he wanted power. At first, he heard about the Golden Dragon Sword, Eldrad. He heard that it was originally struck for me」</p>
<p>「Eldrado is the sword for Trismegistus?」</p>
<p>「Yeah」</p>
<p>To my surprise, Eldorado was apparently a divine sword made for Trismegistus in the fight against the Abyss Eater. A golden dragonkin and a gold dragonkin sword. They certainly seemed to go well together.</p>
<p>Besides, the life expectancy of the price was not a problem for Trismegistus, who was immortal due to Divine Punishment. I felt uncomfortable with the price for a Divine Sword made by Ulmer, but that was how it was, huh?</p>
<p>「Then, why didn’t you use it?」</p>
<p>「I couldn’t get any equipment. Urushi said he was rejecting my El Dorado. When we parted, he told me to take care of Juanaverta... Come to think of it, that was what happened」</p>
<p>Does that mean that Trismegistus back then refused the Divine Sword because he had Juanaverta and didn’t need Eldo?</p>
<p>It was like Fran, wasn’t it? She was just like Fran, who said that if I were here, she didn’t need a Divine Sword.</p>
<p>That’s kinda like what I thought, so staying alive forever must be a much more terrifying punishment than I had imagined. Fran was looking at Trismegistus with a sad expression on her face.</p>
<p>「And he also brought a little girl with him when he came here. She looked like a slave, but she was the same race as the girl there」</p>
<p>A poison user with a lorelei, huh? I’m sure of it.</p>
<p>「......That’s good to hear. It would be enough just to know that we are here. I also saw the possibility of connections between the black market slavers, so we can follow their lead.」</p>
<p>Seliadot mumbled down, suppressing his rage. His figure, combined with the emptiness of Trismegistus in front of him, gave off an intimidating aura.</p>
<p>But Isario was surprised to be able to interrupt.</p>
<p>「I don’t know what’s going on with the Ward Dealer, but can we just continue talking to them for now?」</p>
<p>「I’m sorry. I got a little excited.」</p>
<p>「It’s good. Everyone has their own problems.」</p>
<p>Isario shrugged his shoulders and smiled bitterly as he said that. He was carrying a variety of things, just like what he said. I guess that was why he felt a strange presence behind it.</p>
<p>「Well, Trismegistus-san. I heard that the Abyss Eater’s power has weakened, but can you tell what kind of effect it will have in the future?」</p>
<p>「Indeed. First, there will be no antidemons for a few days. And second, there is no doubt that antidemons will be weakened, even if it is only for a short period of time. estimated at about thirty years.」</p>
<p>「...Are you sure?」</p>
<p>「There is a high possibility that there will be no antidemon season in the meantime.」</p>
<p>「That’s plenty.」</p>
<p>I had thought that Trismegistus would take a little less time to defeat the Abyss Eater, but the impact was even greater than I had imagined.</p>
<p>Simply weakening the antidemons will make it much easier, but the antidemon season will be over for a while? That’s good news for each city.</p>
<p>But the conversation wasn’t that easy. Isario and Jayne looked somewhat reluctant for some reason.</p>
<p>「This could only cause a ruckus if other countries were to find out about it, right?」</p>
<p>「......If things continue to stay stable for 30 years, there will be more people coming into this continent. That’s exactly why the population might explode.」</p>
<p>It’s not just about making sure the people around us are safe. More people will come to this continent, and there will be less chance of death.</p>
<p>In that case, it would not be surprising if the population increased significantly. There was a possibility that they would temporarily increase their forces and gain a dominant position against antidemons.</p>
<p>But what if, after thirty years, the Abyss Eater recovered and was back to the same state as before? She might even find herself in a state with a large amount of food.</p>
<p>In the long run, this could turn negative.</p>
<p>「You wished for the lives of a lot of people this time, but what are you going to do if there are more people again?」</p>
<p>「Of course, it will reduce the number of people in the same way. In the absence of a Divine Swordsman, creating strong antidemons is a risky thing to do, but if we have to avoid doing so, the number of people will continue to increase, benefiting the Abyss Eater」</p>
<p>「Even if he can’t escape from the barrier of the castle, does that mean that it is possible?」</p>
<p>「By observing the failed divine sword, I have completed the design of a magic tool to create powerful antidemons. I can now do the same thing on my own.」</p>
<p>Oh, come to think of it, this guy was a genius alchemist. I don’t know why, but it seems he can make tools to create giant antidemons.</p>
<p>「Isario, Jayne. You all must warn the nations. Use your own rules of duty to stop interfering with our mission. The world is about to be destroyed」</p>
<p>「...It would be impossible to convince each country」</p>
<p>「Next time the Abyss Eater is unleashed, I don’t know if the Gods will rescue him or not, right? For his beings, a human being is only worth that much.」</p>
<p>I was thinking that you shouldn’t say Trismegistus’ words, but I was somewhat convinced. The legends of the Gods were somewhat undead, and many of them were far from words like mercy.</p>
<p>Perhaps, except for unusual Gods like the Goddess of Chaos, Trismegistus’ words are correct. That’s why Divine Punishment is vague and is quite appropriate. I’m not really interested in it. I guess that’s especially true of the Naturally occurring Gods.</p>
<p>「It’s certainly an annoyance to move just like you said, but I can’t say that at all... Taking advantage of this continent may be considered to have used the Abyss Eater and, by extension, the pieces of the Evil Gods. Let’s check it out by such a way of talking」</p>
<p>「It’s been a long time since I’ve had the chance to use my connections to the fullest, huh...? Haah, that’s a bit annoying, but I don’t have a choice」</p>
<p>If Trismegistus could not be eliminated, there was only one thing we could do. In the end, we had to change the way other countries use this continent.</p>
<p>As Isario and Zelos Reed were discussing this with a dark look on their faces, a magic circle suddenly appeared right next to the throne. Among them, the one who came up was a chair very similar to the throne of Trismegistus and a woman sitting on it.</p>
<p>「Is this......?」</p>
<p>「Just now, the Gods gave us the information. Let’s welcome a new sinner, Merit.」</p>
<p>「Trismegistus! This is indeed a castle! Before I knew it......!」</p>
<p>He said he was going to let them fight antidemons with Divine Punishment, but was he going to let them fight together with Trismegistus? I don’t think there was any way Meritte could fight together with him, since he hated the dragonkin.</p>
<p>On the contrary, we might just get in our way. Is this the danger to the world...?</p>
<p>But soon I realized that his fears were unfounded. Meritte began to suffer in front of her.</p>
<p>「Geh! Ghaaah!」</p>
<p>「The moment I think about interfering with my mission, you will be in great pain.」</p>
<p>「Guh, Ghigih......!」</p>
<p>「The same goes for when you are unfulfilled and lazy.」</p>
<p>「Gyii......! Shit, shit......」</p>
<p>「I was the same at first, but soon I realized it was useless. The pain is not that of a resistance type.」</p>
<p>Hearing Trismegistus’ words, he seemed to have given up on interfering with him. The hint of pain disappeared from Meritte’s face. As long as she didn’t think badly, she should be fine.</p>
<p>「......Damn, shit, shit, shit, shit! I won’t give up! One day, I’ll destroy you and the dragonkin!」</p>
<p>「When the mission is completed, we are free. If that feeling remains at that time, we can do whatever we want」</p>
<p>「No matter how many years have passed, I will never forget this feeling! Never!」</p>
<p>Meritte exclaimed with an angry expression and glared at Trismegistus. Trismegistus, on the other hand, was as expressionless as ever.</p>
