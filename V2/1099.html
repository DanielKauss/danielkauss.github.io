</div><h1>Chapter 1099</h1><p>Baron Noaret, despite his pitiful appearance, was quite strong. He never recognized himself as a traitor, and continued to act as a stupid and majestic nobleman. Even though he was still covered in blood, he only said that he didn’t know about him. </p>
<p>「...Urushi」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Hiii!」</p>
<p> The baron lowers his head when he sees a wolf suddenly appear in front of him. No, it looks like he’s pulling off some tricks, but it’s probably an act. It’s amazing that he’s done this thoroughly. It’s amazing that he’s done so thoroughly.  </p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>「W-What are you doing!  Stop!? I don’t think it’ll taste good!」</p>
<p>「Fufun.  I’ll try to keep saying that I don’t know even if you bite me alive」</p>
<p>「Grrrr!」</p>
<p>「Hiiii!」</p>
<p>  As expected, this scream was serious, huh? They must have remembered that theconfessed poison Urushi had learned was more effective when they were mentally weakened.  After scaring Baron Noare with Norinori and screaming several times, it was finally Urushi’s turn. I put a gray smoke on Baron to deprive him of his sound judgment.  Although Dirk needed to be exposed to it many times, Baron Noare’s technique was effective only once. It must have something to do with his resistance to poison.  After confirming that, Fran asked him the question again. </p>
<p>「Where is Raydoss’s spy?」</p>
<p>「I don’t know」</p>
<p>「I know he has escaped here」</p>
<p>「I’ve invited him to this mansion, but he’s nowhere to be found. I really don’t know where he is.」</p>
<p>  Isn’t that really what the Baron himself didn’t know?  Apparently, he was hiding somewhere in the mansion.  There was a presence, and it felt kinda familiar. </p>
<p>「We don’t have any choice. Let’s search the mansion and seize the evidence.」</p>
<p>「Okay.」</p>
<p>  While searching for the stealthy, we used our human-sea tactics to conquer the Baron’s mansion at once. However, we were unable to find the whereabouts of the stealthy until the very end.  We went to all the rooms, including the basement. There were some that looked suspicious, but I just couldn’t find where they were.  Some rooms had a slightly unusual scent from inside the mansion, and the scent was slightly stronger.  Well, I’m a sword, so I can’t smell it. It’s just a matter of image.  There were almost no documents coming out.  However, she had been able to seal off a few tools to secretly reveal her identity with the people of Raydoss. Some tools, such as a knife with an emblem engraved on it and a vial, that could only be seen by him and the other party.  When we asked Baron Noare, he said there was really nothing more we could find.  There was no suspicious facility such as a basement, so it seemed to be strict so that no one could be suspected. </p>
<p>(Secretary, I don’t know where he is.)</p>
<p>『Hmm, it looks like he’s going to keep hiding until we leave.』</p>
<p>(Woof.)</p>
<p>  I guess he’s just going to hide and run away when we’re gone. The reason he won’t run away from us in his current state is probably because he’s confident in his stealth skills, or because he saw through Fran and Urushi’s abilities and realized that he won’t be able to escape, or both of them.  </p>
<p>『I’d like to get caught somehow, but...』</p>
<p>(Leave it to me)</p>
<p>『Huh? Do you have a plan?』</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
<p>  Fran nodded confidently. She seemed to have come up with a way to find Raydoss’s secretaries.  </p>
<p>(Can I do it?)</p>
<p>『Sure, but are you okay with not helping?』</p>
<p>(Nn.  I can do it by myself!)</p>
<p> Since the mock battle with Gumdo a while ago, Fran has been in her training mode. She wants to do what she can. </p>
<p>『If it getting dangerous, I’ll lay a finger on her, okay?』</p>
<p>(Nn. Please.)</p>
<p> Fran nodded lightly and crouched on the ground to activate her magic.  </p>
<p>「Great Wall」</p>
<p> A huge earth wall then blocked the northern part of Noare’s mansion.  </p>
<p>「Eh? What?」</p>
<p>「What’s going on!」</p>
<p> Not only Baron Noare but also Blue and the soldiers on her side voiced in surprise. Some of the soldiers were even on their knees. </p>
<p>『Fran.  I think it’s better to tell them beforehand, okay?』</p>
<p>(?)</p>
<p>『Soldier-san, you’re surprised, aren’t you?』</p>
<p>「Hmm.  I’ll use magic after all」</p>
<p> After informing Blue, she activated Great Wall again without waiting for the other party’s reaction.  The wall appeared to the west and east of the mansion, and surrounded us.  I could feel a slight wavering in the mysterious presence. The mansion that was hiding was suddenly surrounded by a huge wall and must have been surprised.  However, before they could escape, they had blocked another huge wall in the remaining corner. It had been completely blocked by the walls on all sides.  </p>
<p>「Phew. Then, let’s do the next one」</p>
<p>「Eh?」</p>
<p> Leaving the blues with a puzzled look on their faces, Fran jumped up to the top of the wall and peeked inside to activate a new spell.  </p>
<p>「ThunderChain!」</p>
<p>  It was a powerful magic that had low attack power but was paralyzing. I guess Fran’s strategy was to block the escape route with the wall, and then randomly strike lightning magic inside indiscriminately.  Well, it would certainly not have made sense if it was hiding... However, Baron Noare’s mansion was half-destroyed by Fran’s magic, which was released without a pause.  The whole mansion was scorched, so I won’t be able to stay here unless I fix it. </p>
<p>「Hmm?」</p>
<p>『You’re not coming out』</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>  magic didn’t work on him?  As usual, his presence was still weak.  It may be that he had high fighting prowess as well as the ability to hide.  </p>
<p>「Then, look at this!」</p>
<p>  Fran let out even more magic.  What a surprise, Thor’s Hammer.  This means that even if we can identify the whereabouts of his opponent, we won’t be able to kill him... And even if she was hiding her face, if she used this flashy lightning magic, her identity would be exposed...But before I could stop her, a thick thunderbolt engulfed the mansion.</p>
