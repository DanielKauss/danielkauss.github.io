</div><h1>Chapter 1110</h1><p>Klimut stared at the spirit, releasing magic power and standing on his knees.</p>
<p>The Great Spirit of Wind, on the other hand, did not move much either.</p>
<p>Both of them moved slightly in place. However, it seemed that Klimut and the Great Spirit were indeed connected and were in a tug-of-war with each other.</p>
<p>Gradually, sweat began to build up on Klimut’s forehead, and his expression began to contort.</p>
<p>Apparently, this was not something that could be easily done. Then Klimt opened his mouth without looking at us.</p>
<p>「Fran-san, I have a favor to ask you」</p>
<p>「What is it?」</p>
<p>「I want you to attack that Great-Spirit」</p>
<p>「......You’re not gonna be countered?」</p>
<p>It would be dangerous not only for us but also for Klimut and the others if it were to be attacked by the Great Spirit, right?</p>
<p>Klimt shook his head with a look of frustration and fatigue on his face.</p>
<p>「We’ll send the great spirit out of town. As for counterattacks, we’ll have to somehow avoid it. I really don’t want to let them do something like this, but that’s the only way I can do it now」</p>
<p>The reason they were not attacked now was that they were near Klimt. The Great Spirit could not attack them because it might implicate Klimt, who recognized them as a magician.</p>
<p>It must have been thanks to that fact that Urushi and Zenos were safe. That was also the reason why they suddenly stopped attacking us after we passed through the wall of tornadoes.</p>
<p>However, if she attacked, she would be recognized as a complete enemy and would be subject to a fierce counterattack. Even if she knew this, Klimt seemed to have been cornered so much that she had to ask Fran, a child, to attack her.</p>
<p>「Understood」</p>
<p>Fran nodded enthusiastically at my question. I couldn’t just abandon Alessa, so I have no choice...</p>
<p>『I don’t know what kind of counterattack we’ll see. Let’s go with the intention of fighting the strongest enemy in the history of mankind』</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
<p>Klimt told Fran about his weakness.</p>
<p>「There’s something at the core of it. Please target that part」</p>
<p>「What do you mean by “somewhere”?」</p>
<p>「I’m sure it’s her torso... But Fran-san can use spirit magic, right?」</p>
<p>「Do you know?」</p>
<p>Klimt said that with a confident look on his face. He shouldn’t have told her that he had learned to use Spirit Magic. But it seemed that Klimt knew.</p>
<p>「It seems that spirits are reacting to it. If you have Spirit Magic skills, you should be able to find its nucleus. Maybe」</p>
<p>T-Probably... No, it was an emergency that we had no choice but to go there. On the surface, Klimt looked calm, but in reality, he might be close to his limit.</p>
<p>「Should we just attack the core?」</p>
<p>「Yes. Due to that undead attack, the Great Spirit has weakened. If we could weaken it even more, we would have complete control over it. Then it might be possible to return it」</p>
<p>「Great spirit, can I return it to you?」</p>
<p>Wasn’t he a trump card for Klimut? He must be the spirit that was the source of his alias, and one that was representative of Klimut.</p>
<p>But Klimt nodded back at Fran with a wry smile.</p>
<p>「It doesn’t matter. It was the spirit, it was me」</p>
<p>They said that she was losing her abilities because she was focused on sealing, and maybe she just wanted to unload the burden.</p>
<p>「How did the enemy manage to hurt the spirit?」</p>
<p>Oh, and I’m curious about that too. Maybe we could use it to our advantage when we attack.</p>
<p>But Klimt shook his head with a bitter look on his face.</p>
<p>「We can’t imitate it. It was the Evil Spirit. The Evil Spirit that was poured into it had damaged the spirit and made it go out of control even further」</p>
<p>「Evil energy...」</p>
<p>If it was evil, there was nothing I couldn’t use. But if I wanted to let it go out of control, it would be dangerous, right? I’m sure it was quite a bet.</p>
<p>「It seems that the weapon that that the undead possessed originally had the property of devouring magic power. An evil spirit was added to it, and my defenses were broken through. Magic Absorption-type attacks might be effective in breaking through the spirit’s defenses」</p>
<p>Eat magic, huh? This must be a skill similar to the magic sword Soul Drain, used by a swordsman named Valusa, who fought in the town of Dards. Maybe Raidos succeeded in mass-producing it.</p>
<p>That’s why maybe our Magic Absorption and Magic Stealth would be more effective. We got some good information.</p>
<p>「You ready?」</p>
<p>「Nn! I can go at any time!」</p>
<p>「Then we’ll send the Great Spirit out of town. It will take a lot of strength, so please think that we won’t have much time after that」</p>
<p>「...Okay」</p>
<p>Hearing Fran’s nod, I could see that Klimut’s concentration increased a notch.</p>
<p>「Let’s go!」</p>
<p>A tremendous amount of magic power was released from Klimut’s entire body. The momentum was so great that Urushi and the others standing next to him were even incited to back down on him.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Great Spirit began to move. It was moving slowly. Despite its huge body moving, it had no physical presence at all. footsteps were natural, and there was no movement of wind.</p>
<p>It was as if the hologm was moving.</p>
<p>We held our breath and waited a few minutes. The Great Spirit was about a hundred meters away from the town. It seemed that we would not be able to receive any more orders from it.</p>
<p>「I’m counting on you for a serious blow」</p>
<p>「The Great Spirit is not dead?」</p>
<p>「It would be a big deal if we could do that. I don’t have to hesitate」</p>
<p>Then let’s do it spectacularly.</p>
<p>『Looks like you don’t need any hesitation』</p>
<p>「Nn. Okay, I’ll go all out.」</p>
<p>「Yeah, and if at all possible, I’d like you to stay away from the town」</p>
<p>「...Okay」</p>
<p>「I’m afraid of that in the meantime!」</p>
<p>Me too!</p>
<p>『Fran, you’re not pretending to be, right?』</p>
<p>(Fran?)</p>
<p>『...It’s nothing. Just be careful, okay?』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
