</div><h1>Chapter 1083</h1><p>The dusty wilderness. The trees and even the undergrowth were not growing well, and the dry and reddish ground continued.</p>
<p>This rugged land lying between the Kranzel Kingdom and the Shallus Kingdom was not worth using, so both countries did not insist on their territories and split the center as their border.</p>
<p>In the middle of the wilderness, a horrible army advanced with silence.</p>
<p>All it could hear was a strangely hard sound created by the march and an unpleasant sound emitted from the scraping of armor. I couldn’t hear the sound of breathing, let alone the words being spoken.</p>
<p>And of course, that was all that mattered.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just people who made the march.</p>
<p>The most common ones were probably the undead. They were zombie soldiers who wore armor and continued to walk at the same speed with their spears on their backs.</p>
<p>The undead body and equipment were of poor quality, showing inconspicuousness as a force to be reckoned with. However, since there were so many of them, they might be of use for occupiers and diversion. There were probably well over 5,000 of them.</p>
<p>Leading the undead in this army were golems as glistening as precious stones.</p>
<p>It was not a gem, but a golem made of a magic stone. The sight of more than a hundred deformed golems marching in a row was even spectacular.</p>
<p>We were quite late for this out-of-people army, and the troops of what seemed to be the Kingdom of Shallus’ army were following us. Were they afraid of the undead or were planning to use them to dispel them? Maybe they were about a kilometer away?</p>
<p>(Magic stone soldier)</p>
<p>『Yeah. They’re definitely an army of the Raidos Kingdom』</p>
<p>I don’t know if he was Zelyse or his disciple Ansel, but there was no doubt he was involved in this invasion.</p>
<p>「That’s somewhere...」</p>
<p>「Zelyse’s magic stone soldier」</p>
<p>「I see! That’s when!」</p>
<p>Gamudo shouted with a clap. He must have remembered the magic stone soldier that Zelyse was controlling during the commotion in Barbra. At that time, the group of adventurers was in chaos against several magic stone soldiers.</p>
<p>Gamudo must have had a hard time dealing with the magic stone soldiers who had reflexive abilities too. Moreover, the magic stone soldiers this time were probably stronger than ever. They moved much smoother than the ones we fought before.</p>
<p>Does he mean to be the latest type? Anyway, he must be the strongest magic stone soldier in the history of mankind.</p>
<p>『Well, no matter how strong you are, it doesn’t matter much to me』</p>
<p>(Nn! All of it is Master’s food!)</p>
<p>『Hahaha! You’re right! I’ll make it taste good!』</p>
<p>That said, I’ll make sure I’m ready for defense. After all, I don’t know what kind of attacks might come at us.</p>
<p>「Gamdo. I’ll take care of the magic stone soldiers.」</p>
<p>「Now that I think about it, she had the skill to defeat it with a single shot」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Alright! Then leave the undead and the humans behind to us!」</p>
<p>「Nn. Gamudo and Urushi will take care of it」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Urushi nodded, but Gamudo shook his head.</p>
<p>「Yeah」</p>
<p>「What do you mean?」</p>
<p>「Did you feel it?」</p>
<p>「...? Oh, something’s coming...」</p>
<p>At the same time Fran, I noticed a flying object approaching us at high speed. After waiting for a while, something like a brown wyvern approached us.</p>
<p>Parts of it had rotted off, exposing the bones and internal organs inside. This was definitely an undead, but not one from Raydoss.</p>
<p>「Diaz, Fermus, Eiworth.」</p>
<p>『Let’s step on the strongest of the old men!』</p>
<p>There were three old men on the back of the undead wyvern.</p>
<p>「You really did come, everyone!」</p>
<p>「It’s been a long time, Gamudo. It’s as hot and humid as ever.」</p>
<p>「You’re the same, Eiworth, huh?」</p>
<p>Eihwaz, who had experience in working together in the Royal Capital, held the Wyvern’s reins. The level of necromancy was low, but would that allow him to use a Wyvern like this? Well, it wouldn’t be surprising if Eihwaz could do something like this.</p>
<p>「This man is unwell」</p>
<p>「You’re Diaz, still talking like always.」</p>
<p>He was Diaz, the Guild Master of Ulmut and an active Rank A adventurer. He had fought with this old man in a martial arts tournament before. He was one of the few people who knew who I was.</p>
<p>「Stop arguing on the battlefield.」</p>
<p>「Hahaha! Both of you, don’t cause any trouble for Fermus!」</p>
<p>「Tch!」</p>
<p>「Hmph.」</p>
<p>Felmus, the owner of a restaurant called “Dragon Restaurant” that specializes in dragon dishes and a thread user, is as handsome as ever. I can’t believe he’s as young as the others.</p>
<p>Gamudo the Dragon Tripper, Eiworth the Dragon Binding, Diaz the Dragon Tripper, and Fermus the Dragon Hunter were all members of a legendary dragon party made up of Rank A adventurers.</p>
<p>「I called them here to protect Barbra!」</p>
<p>「I thought the town’s defense was boring, but I guess it’s getting even more interesting!」</p>
<p>「The Kingdom of Shallus was bothered by them in the martial arts tournament after all. Shall we try to make them a little irritated?」</p>
<p>「Don’t be too excited」</p>
<p>Well, the old men were really motivated. Anyways, it was a very unique party. I can imagine the hardships of Fermus, who seemed to be the leader of the party.</p>
<p>「Leave the magic stone golems to Fran, and we’ll strike the undead and the Shallus army behind them. Okay」</p>
<p>「Leave it to me!」</p>
<p>「Understood」</p>
<p>「Understood」</p>
<p>Neither Diaz nor Fermus raised their voices to worry about Fran. It was probably because they fully understood her power.</p>
<p>But I had one question.</p>
<p>『Can I call Diaz “this way”? Alessa or something like that from the Royal Capital, right?』</p>
<p>(Hahaha. The royal capital can be managed by the knights alone. Alessa is...... safe.)</p>
<p>『...Come to think of it, you were scared of Klimut, right?』</p>
<p>(N-no, that’s not it! I’m not here because I was afraid to fight alongside Klimt-dono! I just couldn’t abandon my old friends!)</p>
<p>This old man was still in Freedom. No wait, everyone here was in Freedom.</p>
<p>「Well then, let’s go!」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「「「Yeah!」」」</p>
