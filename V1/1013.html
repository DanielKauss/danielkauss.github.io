</div><h1>Chapter 1013</h1><p>Immediately after Fran ran off to escape, there was a huge explosion behind her. Isario released his divine sword.</p>
<p>『In the end, I was asked by Isario to do this.』</p>
<p>(Nn......)</p>
<p>She must have been frustrated, Fran bit on her lip. But she did not stop.</p>
<p>I used all my strength to move around, just as fast as I could. I knew that getting out of here quickly would help Isario.</p>
<p>Isario must have been very interested in Trismegistus since no one was chasing after him.</p>
<p>But it should have been quite difficult to discuss with them now. Fran was still angry, and she said that she would destroy us too.</p>
<p>『But that doesn’t change the fact that you saved us.』</p>
<p>When I was destroyed, the pieces of the Evil Gods would disappear against Fenrir-san. At the very least, I didn’t expect them to be lies, and the power of Trismegistus’ dragonkin was said to be tremendous. There was a good chance that they would be right.</p>
<p>In other words, the part that could remain even if it was destroyed. I guess their purpose was the system for strengthening and growth that they say was made by the Goddess of Chaos in her dungeon.</p>
<p>Juanaverta also said that he was jealous of my growth potential despite being a sword. However, Fenrir-san has the power to grow me. I don’t think it would be meaningless if I were to take him away...</p>
<p>But I wondered if she didn’t really see that, or if she had a different goal.</p>
<p>Fran kept running and headed out of the castle while I was remembering Juanaverta’s words.</p>
<p>(If we take that turn, we’ll just have a little more time to exit!)</p>
<p>『Alright! If we leave the castle grounds at once――』</p>
<p>We passed through the throne room and were about to leave the castle.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>Her feet shook her head.</p>
<p>The impact of the battle between Isario and Zelos Reed had been conveyed to us, but the situation didn’t seem to be so easy.</p>
<p>Unable to withstand the uncontrollable shock, cracks began to form on the floor and walls of the castle, and they were gradually starting to stretch out. The crack in the floor, which continued to run while crushing the stone material, was already deep enough to make me think that I was about to take a step into it.</p>
<p>『This is bad! It’s collapsing!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>The crack finally began to stretch to the ceiling, and pieces of stones of all sizes began to rain down on us. The castle, which was protected by the power of the Gods, barely scratched by any decent power, was about to collapse in an instant.</p>
<p>What I could feel from the basement of the castle was just the power of powerful antidemons. The swollen presence of antidemons was so strong that it made me wonder if my detection skills had been bugged.</p>
<p>In terms of the size of her power, even Isario and Ashwrath when using the Divine Sword Release had probably lost.</p>
<p>『Could it be, the Abyss Eater?』</p>
<p>Fran continued to move her feet as if to make a rattling sound as the castle fell apart. Then she jumped out.</p>
<p>「Just in time!」</p>
<p>『The castle... Get away from it!』</p>
<p>Immediately after Fran jumped back, a large amount of rubble fell on the spot. It was part of the stone wall that Fran was carrying. And that was not the end.</p>
<p>The spire of the castle had collapsed and now I could see it falling.</p>
<p>Fran moved further away from the castle, avoiding the debris. The bigger picture showed that the castle was not the only one affected. The entire hill where the castle stood had been ripped open and was beginning to crumble.</p>
<p>Besides, the hill was clearly expanding. It seemed to be being pushed up by a strong force from below. What was going on under this huge hill?</p>
<p>Crap!</p>
<p>『The ground is......! Fran! Jump!』</p>
<p>The slope of the hill had collapsed, and large ground cracks were running in all directions. Just before we were swallowed by the deep crack, Fran jumped out of the hill at once.</p>
<p>「Something’s coming!」</p>
<p>『That’s pretty big!』</p>
<p>Parts of the castle burst from the inside, and a huge shadow appeared from within. In terms of size, it was probably larger than a giant antidemon.</p>
<p>Its magic power was comparable to that of a giant――but it was also a fusion of two large giant-types.</p>
<p>「It’s red and golden...... The one who was in the basement?」</p>
<p>『Yeah, they certainly have similar wavelengths of magic power, but...』</p>
<p>They looked not only colored and magical, but also similar. Could it be that the red-golden antidemon we had been fighting in the basement had turned into something huge? Could it be that the giant-type antidemon was an experiment to create that one?</p>
<p>Standing up, destroying the castle, the huge red-golden antidemons moved their shoulders and chests up and down as if they were breathing deeply.</p>
<p>As I stared up at the face of the antidemon far above in amazement, I heard a familiar loud laugh.</p>
<p>「Ahahahahahaha! I’ve reached this point! The life force hasn’t gathered, and I’ve been planning to eat Overgrowth for a long time, but it’s gone! I didn’t expect the plan to go crazy so much, but the vessel was completed here! The birth of the strongest antidemons!」</p>
<p>The source of the explosion was the shoulders of a giant antidemon. Then, there was Mertritte. A lorelei girl, who looked like a child of an elf, glared at us with a wicked demon-like expression.</p>
<p>It seems that antidemons have advanced. Some of their hands and faces have been transformed into antidemons.</p>
<p>「I’ll crush them all!」</p>
<p>「Meltorite!」</p>
<p>「Little girl! Stay there and watch! You will destroy everything!」</p>
<p>Immediately after Meritte shouted so, the sun suddenly began to set. A huge shadow then covered the earth. Looking up at the sky, I saw a purple dye spreading rapidly in the sky.</p>
<p>Did the barrier surrounding the castle change color? No, it was even higher. The translucent purple dome covered a wide area. It was not as big as the barrier that covered the continent, but it was a purple dome that seemed to be a few kilometers in diameter.</p>
<p>Was this the work of Merritte?</p>
<p>But as we were puzzled, Meritte’s shout fell.</p>
<p>「No one can escape with this now! This antidemon will devour everything!」</p>
<p>「What do you mean?」</p>
<p>Fran asked back as if she was screaming, but Meritte hadn’t seen her anymore. She was glaring back at the earth in the distance, screaming back.</p>
<p>「Destroy! Ahahaha! Destroy!」</p>
