</div><h1>Chapter 961</h1><p>When Fran and Charon arrived at the gate, the situation there was quite miserable. Outside the gate, adventurers fought antidemons with curses from the others, and many injured were lined up inside. Most of the adventurers in Brutori were gathered, and half of them were unfit for battle. The army of antidemons had already reached the wall, so it was unlikely that they would have another half an hour before they died. </p>
<p>「Miss Hilt! Can you heal them? If it’s not possible, I’ll go to treat the injured!」</p>
<p> Isario, please go outside!」</p>
<p>「Yes! I’ll leave it to you!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  Fran loved Isario a lot and respected him.  I could tell that by looking at him.  I guess it was because his freedom was close to his ideal. There was no way that Fran would not be motivated by such Isario’s request. </p>
<p>(Master, let’s help everyone!)</p>
<p>『Ou!  First of all, we should make sure that no one dies by using Circle Heals. And those who are still dangerous will be healed by Greater Heal after that』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  As Fran landed on the main street, she checked the surroundings.  </p>
<p>「Uuh...」</p>
<p>「Agha......」</p>
<p>「Giyeeh......」</p>
<p>  Most of the more than a hundred adventurers who had been laid down were left unattended. Those who could fight were blocked from the antidemon invasion outside the walls, and those who couldn’t fight were unable to move because of their magic absorption.  Just in case, people like town doctors were giving first aid and healers were running around.  However, because of the magic absorption and Evil Spirit sickness, they were unable to move as usual and could not use magic. It was not very, but I didn’t think that she could save everyone. Fran used a series of wide-area recovery spells as the injured adventurers walked down the main street where they had been laid.  Because she prioritized wide areas, the recovery rate of one person was low. Although seriously wounded people could not recover fully, they should be able to at least take their lives.  After about twenty times using Circle Heal with Fran and me, most of the adventurers must have been saved.  They then started to get up with astonishment on their faces. They didn’t seem to know what had happened after their wounds healed suddenly.  They were looking around fidgeting.  However, there were only a few who could not get up yet. Some of them were already gone, and others were not fully recovered because they were seriously injured. I went to cast Greater Heal on the seriously wounded while paying my respects to those who have never woken up anymore.  </p>
<p>「Phew...  This is my last attack」</p>
<p>『All right, let’s go to the outside to give you support.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p> Fran turned on her heel, but a panicked voice appeared on her back.  </p>
<p>「W-Where are we going!?」</p>
<p>  There is a town doctors with a white beard. The old man looked at Fran with concern as she was about to head for the wall.  </p>
<p>「I’ve done my work here, so I’m going to help out here.」</p>
<p>「We don’t need any precious healers to go outside! Stay here until the battle is over!」</p>
<p>「We’ll be fine」</p>
<p>「What are you talking about! Leave the dangerous part to the adventurers!」</p>
<p>  He was a person who came all the way to the side of the battlefield to perform first aid.  He was basically a good person. His tone may sound like an important person, but the worry about turning to Fran was real.  He seemed to think that Fran was a healing expert.  Well, it couldn’t be helped if he didn’t think that she would even fight at his age. Besides, on this continent, people wore weapons even if they were not adventurers, and it was hard to tell if someone was an adventurer just by looking at them.  </p>
<p>「Don’t worry」</p>
<p>「Wha?  Wait――」</p>
<p>  The old man tried to keep Fran quiet even more, but Fran ignored him and headed for the wall. He probably didn’t want to spend time explaining the emergency to them.  With the eyes of the old man and the adventurers who understood that Fran had healed them behind his back, he used aerial hop to jump over the wall.  From there, we could see the battlefield below us.  </p>
<p>「A lot of antidemons.  A lot of people were injured.」</p>
<p>『We’re left behind.』</p>
<p>  They already couldn’t afford to transport the injured into the wall. Dead bodies and injured people were gathered in one place and lying on the ground as if they were being abandoned.  </p>
<p>「Let’s help them.」</p>
<p>『Yeah! Let’s heal the surrounding antidemons first.』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  When Fran landed in front of the wall, she healed the injured who were unable to move and dispelled some of the antidemons. The adventurers around her noticed Fran there.  In order to heal their wounds, Fran used more recovery magic.  Fortunately, most of the adventurers were gathering in front of the gate. It was probably because the antidemons held them back. Isario, who headed for the rescue, was a little further away from the gate. His defense-oriented style seemed to have attracted the attention of antidemons as usual.  Isario, who hadn’t made any noticeable attacks while spreading an enormous amount of magic power, must have looked like a treat to the antidemons.  Except for the antidemons fighting near the gate, most of the remaining individuals were focused on Isario. Because of this, they seemed to be losing a lot of pressure on the adventurers.  With Fran’s further appearance, they seemed to have regained a little more composure.  </p>
<p>「Y-you has saved us」</p>
<p>「I’ll rebuild you now」</p>
<p>「Y-yes!」</p>
<p> The adventurers seemed to know Fran, and began to follow our orders quietly. However, they couldn’t get very close to Isario, so the adventurers took the form of guarding the castle gate, with Fran holding back the antidemons in front of them. If the antidemons’ eyes turned to us, we would have used a wide area attack to attack them at once, but Isario’s hate control was perfect.  By continuously releasing magic power to the surroundings, he had attracted the antidemons’ attention to himself until the very end.By continuously releasing magic power to those around her, she had attracted the antidemons’ attention to herself until the very end.  After years of fighting on this continent, she must have understood exactly how much mana she released and how much antidemons would recognize her.  </p>
<p>「There’s only a big residue.」</p>
<p>『Yeah.』</p>

<p>『Yeah.』</p>
<p> The culprit of this situation, the giant antidemons sleeping with their knees, was the one who glared at her.</p>
