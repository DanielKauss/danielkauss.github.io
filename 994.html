</div><h1>Chapter 994</h1><p>Trismegistus, clad in golden mana, ascended down the stairs, his mana illuminating the surroundings. </p>
<p>「......!」</p>
<p>「Hmm. We don’t have that many today?」</p>
<p>few? What about this? At the end of the stairs, we found a terrifyingly large underground room. Even we, with dark vision, could not see the end of the stairs. It was probably less than 100 meters or 200 meters. It was hard to believe that such a large space existed in that hill, and the space may be distorted. It was hard to believe that such a large space existed in that hill, and the space might be distorted. Since this place was related to the power of the Gods, it would not be surprising if it was only a kilometer or two in size.  In such an underground world, there were countless antidemons that Fran could not help but gasp.  Moreover, all of them were strong. Only high-ranking antidemons with a threat level of C or B-rank were swarming hundreds of them.  Their hostility turned to us at once, as if they had noticed Trismegistus, who was radiating delicious magic power. That alone was enough to make Fran, Urushi, and Frederick feel stiff.  However, Trismegistus, who was subject to such hostility, did not move. He walked into the room with the exact same light steps as before, as if he was going for a walk.  I see, it was not a normal mind. Rather than being reliable or anything like that, I felt more uncomfortable with the unusualness.  This was probably another part of Trismegistus’ monstrous nature.  </p>
<p>「Miss Hilt, never enter the room.」</p>
<p>「As long as you’re here, the antidemons won’t attack us.」</p>
<p>  The stairs and the room were apparently blocked by some kind of barrier, so the antidemons didn’t seem to be coming into us. In a sense, this was the best special seats they’ve ever been.  The antidemons who found an intruder into the Sanatorium began to move. They are all special in their own right.  A large antidemon with arms, an antidemon like a horse, and an antidemon with multiple faces.  If we fight, we can only get three at most. Even if we went all out without thinking about exhaustion, we would not be able to take on 100 of them.  No matter how strong Trismegistus is, how are we going to deal with these antidemons? Will we target the areas where there are few of them and break through them?  However, Trismegistus’ abilities were far beyond my imagination. wings had grown on his back, covering his forehead, arms, legs, and neck with golden scales. The horns and claws were extended, and their pupils were as long as a dragon.  And most conspicuously, the golden magic power gained even more shine. But now it was gushing from all over their bodies like a raging flame.  </p>
<p>『 Divine Dragon Form! I knew it!』</p>
<p>「... Strong」</p>
<p>「Woof」</p>
<p>『Yeah.  To be honest, I didn’t expect anything like this...』</p>
<p>  The golden dragonkin hit the sky with his wings and accelerated in an instant. Even Fran and I, who had been watching him for a long time, were so fast that we had completely lost sight of him.  When we realized it, we were already 100 meters away.  That was the only way to say it. If it were us who were hostile, Fran and Urushi would have been beheaded before they realized it.  In terms of the size of magic power alone, it was one of the strongest in the history of its kind. They were not as good as Weena Rhyn’s when she used the Demigod transformation.  As expected, they were not as good as the super-enhanced Weena Rhyn who was using the Demigod transformation + Borrowing In Advance.  However, Trismegistus still seemed to have some room for leeway. If we could further enhance ourselves from here, we would be on par with Weena Rhyn, who was serious. In other words, he was one of the most powerful people in the world.  </p>
<p>「Dragon Flame Whirlpool」</p>
<p>  Trismegistus wielded his arm and the flames swirled, turning several antidemons into ashes.  </p>
<p>「Dragon ice chain」</p>
<p>  This time it was ice. The white mist released from the body of the golden dragonkin enveloped a wide area, causing the antidemons to freeze and shatter.  Rather than magic, it was more a skill, huh...? I had the impression that each dragonkin was specialized and had strengths in their own right......  Trismegistus had mastered various attributes. He not only used fire and ice, but also wind and lightning attacks.  In the first place, as a golden dragonkin, we didn’t know much about them. It was different from the divine attribute.  </p>
<p>「What dragonkin is Trismegistus?  Since he’s gold, lightning?  Light?」</p>
<p>「Yeah.  Golden-scaled dragonkin have special attributes that only royalty can give birth to. They contain a high-level dragonkin, the “dragonkin” attribute.  It is a high-level magical power called the “dragonkin” attribute, or “Kinga” or “All-around” attribute.  It is said to be a proof of the King’s Godlike nature, which contains all attributes. To put it bluntly, they’re royalty or the Golden Dragonkin.」</p>
<p>  Apparently, the Golden Dragonkin were special beings with multiple attributes. So they could use such a wide variety of abilities.  In addition, their swordsmanship was also amazing. Trismegistus did not stop for a moment, moving around at high speed and slashing away at the antidemons.  With the constant flow of attribute attacks and swordsmanship, the high-ranking antidemons were buried as small fry.  Fran stared at their movements with a serious look on her face. Even a monster piercing her was trying to gain something.  She believed that it would catch up to them eventually.</p>
<p>『You’re right』</p>
