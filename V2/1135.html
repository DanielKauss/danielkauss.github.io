</div><h1>Chapter 1135</h1><p>After the demise of the Zhu Flame Knights, we left Forrund to Urushi as he ran out of power and headed towards the undead army behind. The adventurers were struggling thanks to the white light of protection that surrounded them. However, the soldiers of the nobles were somewhat puzzled. Was it because only the adventurers were suddenly strengthened? But that was not all. </p>
<p>「Why are you killing each other?」</p>
<p>「W-We’re both gonna attack each other!」</p>
<p>「W-We’re gonna attack both of them!」</p>
<p>「I-is that fine?」</p>
<p> It was because of the Avenger we brought with us! He seemed to be confused when he saw the ghouls attacking the undead.  But even so, the undead army was beginning to fall into a disadvantage.  </p>
<p>「Avenger! You have betrayed them, huh!?」</p>
<p>「Fuhahaha!  We get a new divine revelation!」</p>
<p>「We weren’t sane from the very beginning, but we’ve gone even crazier! How is your loyalty to the Kingdom of Raidos, the one who created us?」</p>
<p>「Just because it was manipulated from the very beginning, there is not a hint of allegiance in the Kingdom of Raidos! In fact, the hatred we carry is the one that Raidos created and will surely repel!」</p>
<p> It seems that Avenger was able to successfully eliminate the commander of the undead army called the Scavenger.It seems that Avenger was able to successfully eliminate the commander of the undead army known as the scavengers.  This scavenger had low fighting ability, but also powerful necromancy abilities and the Physical Simultaneous Manipulation skill that was created after her research on Hydeman.This scavenger had a low fighting ability, but it also had a powerful necromancy ability and the Physical Simultaneous Manipulation skill that was created after her research on Hydeman.  It was an undead that was created with the concept of endlessly multiplying and taking command of him.It was an undead that was created with the concept of endlessly multipliing and taking command, capable of increasing one’s number as many as one body.  It seems that both the scavengers and Avengers were inferior in overall strength to their superiors, but they had sharper abilities that surpassed even their superiors in one point.  However, this guy was just like a squad captain or a company captain, not a commander. The undead army was led by a large, undead undead with two horns on his head.  It was a completely naked demon.  It was not a demon, but an undead ogre. However, his skin was as black as charcoal, and he didn’t have any sexual organs.  That’s why he looked like a doll.  This was Chardman, the fifth seat of the Black Skeleton Army’s “Black Burns”.  He was an undead specialized in combat, manipulating explosions. Well, even though he was the commander, it was the scavengers who were actually in charge.  However, there was no doubt that the undead army was gaining momentum because Chardman was leading the way.  So, we were going to eliminate it, but――  </p>
<p>「Nuooooooorgh!  Brilliant Flame Fist!」</p>
<p>「Doraaaah! Intimidation, anger, and dance!」</p>
<p>  The two demons were busy killing each other.  A demon in a white light faced the jet-black necromancy demon.  Chardman and Donadrond stopped and exchanged attacks with each other. It was not a skillful battle like dodging and slashing.  They took turns hitting each other with their blows, their regenerative abilities heal their wounds, and once they were sure that their opponent had survived, they clashed again. In the middle of the strange gap that had formed between the undead and the adventurers, such a primordial battle for life was waged.  </p>
<p>「You lazy fuckwads! I’ll make effective use of your body!」</p>
<p>「I won’t lose!  For the sake of my comrades, I will never lose!」</p>
<p>  Could Chardman be bigger than I had heard in advance, and he has a higher fighting power? It seemed that there was something even Avenger didn’t know about.  His body was covered with flames, and explosions occurred every time he was hit. In addition, he seemed to have exploded behind him during his attack and accelerated as a backlash. His weapon was his fist, but the power of each blow was probably at the level at which he could shatter a huge rock. I wondered how strong Donad was, since he was only slightly injured by being able to take such an attack head-on.  It would be difficult to coordinate with him unless we know what kind of abilities he had. With that as an excuse, I appraised Donadrond.Unique SkillsInnate Skills for the Demon God’s BlessingInnate Skills for Demons, Brilliant Titles as GuardiansGuild Instructor EquipmentHeavy alchemy large axe, black steel giant ruffian full-body armor, raging tiger cloak, stone dragon shoes, bracelet of great strength </p>
<p>「Mutation, huh!?」</p>
<p>  It seems that demonkin don’t evolve, but they sometimes cause mutation.  Ashwrath’s Mad Ogre skill, which was also the trigger for his outbursts, was also caused by his mutation in a race called the Calamity Demon.  I had heard that this mutation was not caused by level, but by various things...  I didn’t expect Donad to mutate. Moreover, from the looks of it, it didn’t seem to be a dangerous mutation like Ashwrath’s.  My status has gone up, and so have my skills such as regeneration.  When we first met Donadrond, he must have been killed instantly by Chardman. However, he was able to fight head-on.  Gradually, the tide was turning to Chardman.  Judging from his name and skills, this Donadrond’s guardian demon was probably a race with the power to protect his comrades.  His attack power was not so great compared to his defense power. No, he has also been strengthened a few notches, but it seems that it is not enough to defeat Chardman.  Fran moved to a position that was visible from Donad. And Donad must have sensed that we were about to join in the support by showing us a light poised stance.  Then, Donad shook his head lightly. Did he say that he didn’t need assistance?  Fran and Donad stared at each other for a moment.  Then, Fran attacked the undead around her instead of Chardman.  </p>
<p>『Are you sure?』</p>
<p>(Nn.  Donad has some thoughts. So it’s okay)</p>
<p>『I see.  Let’s get rid of the undead so that they can at least fight more easily』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  As we defeated the undead, the balance between Donadrond and Chardman finally broke. Chardman’s fist blew Donad away, and then the magic of the explosion exploded as an afterthought.  </p>
<p>「Ora ora ora!  That’s it! Blow them up into pieces!」</p>
<p>  He managed to get up, but Donad didn’t put much force into his knees.  At this rate, he won’t be able to stop him! But it was just right after that thought passed through my head.  </p>
<p>「...... The antidemon method」</p>
<p>「Gugaaaaah!」</p>
<p>  Donad muttered something, and at that moment, there were countless holes in Chardman’s body.  </p>
<p>「N-No, no... shit, ghaa......」</p>
<p>  Immediately after Chardman’s misdeeds, his body exploded.  That would no longer be able to regenerate. It was the end of an endless mass of violence that unites the undead.  No, what happened? I think Donad has done something to him...Anyway, it was surprisingly fast.</p>
