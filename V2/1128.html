</div><h1>Chapter 1128</h1><p>The Kranzel Kingdom’s army continued to advance at the ready from the start. Before we knew it, the undead around us attacked from behind, and the knights of red armor attacked from the front. There were over 2,000 undead, but there were only about 200 of them, so the red knights were unusually strong. </p>
<p>「Donad-san! This is bad! Raydoss’s army appeared from behind the fort!」</p>
<p>「Another one, huh!? What’s going on in the front!」</p>
<p> What’s going on in the front!」</p>
<p>「I’m trying to hold them back with the knights, but this is bad!」</p>
<p>「I’m sure they are the red knights!」</p>
<p> The scout adventurers we scouted out one after another, but there was not even one good thing to know.  The red knight.  That reminded me too. I remember what the captives said about the guardian knights of this country. The strongest knights in red armor were unbound by anything and continued to protect the security of the country.  I knew for a fact that they were powerful, but I never expected them to be this strong. The Raydoss knights in the front of us during our invasion were just like small fry compared to the red knights!  </p>
<p>「Gyaaah! Save them!」</p>
<p>「Guf......!  How pathetic!」</p>
<p>「W-Argaa!」</p>
<p>  Even though the knights, soldiers, and adventurers combined were nearly five times larger than the knights, their march did not stop. They were overwhelmingly defeated in a melee battle.  If a new recruit appeared on their path, they would be attacked from three sides.  They would have to do something to get them in danger.  The only screams they could hear were those of their friends.  Moreover, from time to time, flame magic could erupt into a huge explosion. They had a barrier to prevent magic, but it couldn’t cover a wide area enough to prevent everything.  They must have been made up of high-ranking magic knights.  speaking of adventurers, each one of them was a C ranker or higher. That was how they worked together as a knight. They were terrifyingly strong.  The adventurers were also hurt a lot.  A terrible commander, huh?  I could hear their teeth creaking. But still, I can only inspire my comrades.  I want to go forward and use this huge figure as a shield to protect my comrades.  But I can’t do that. If I leave my posts, the commander will be confused and the damage will be even more severe.  </p>
<p>「You need Forrund to run a message! Get back here!」</p>
<p>「Understood!」</p>
<p>「Donad-san!  This is not good! It looks like a few nobles were attacked from behind and a nobleman died!」</p>
<p>「Tch!  Can’t leave them alone?  Okay!  I will be covering for the nobles in the back. Together with them, we will kick the undead out of the encirclement!」</p>
<p>「U-Understood!」</p>
<p>「The vanguard will rush in with me! The rearguard, along with the scout, will cover them up!」</p>
<p>  Once they had distanced themselves from the fort and re-established themselves, that was how dangerous it would be.  That’s why I led the adventurers into the backlash.  They sent messengers to inform the knights of their movements. </p>
<p>「Hold it!」</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Yeeaahh!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>  The undead were quite strong.  At first glance, they looked like ordinary zombies or skeletons, but their movements were quick and strong. They were much more troublesome than ordinary humans because they could move forward without pain.  The unexpected resistance slowed down their advance.  This would be dangerous at this rate.  The red knights were still approaching us from behind.  </p>
<p>「Kill those fools in Kranzel!」</p>
<p>「Die this place with their blood!」</p>
<p>「Kill them alive, kill them!」</p>
<p>  Each time a cry similar to the roar of the red knights echoed, the people on our side lost their lives. And the enemy was not serious yet.  </p>
<p>「burn, ignite! My vermilion flames, turn into ashes!」</p>
<p>  I thought a war cry echoed through the air, but a huge magic circle was drawn to the sky. I could see it even from warriors like me who were dull to mana.  It was dangerous. They pierced through the barrier and caused a huge explosion. It was similar to the flame magic that Fran had used before at the entrance of the goblin dungeon, but this one was much more powerful and had many of them.  </p>
<p>「Gyaaah!」</p>
<p>「A-Are you sure...」</p>
<p> The red flames scattered about made my friends collapse.  They burned, charred, and crushed.  My friends were dying.  I couldn’t do anything.  All I could do is encourage my friends and swing an axe at the undead. I have to escape this place before there is any more damage!  But my wishes came true, and a magic circle was drawn up again in the sky. This is really bad.  It’s close to our adventurers’ troops. There might be more damage than before.  It’s worthless!  I don’t have any anger towards the enemy, nor do I have any resentment toward the nobles for pushing through my reckless operations. What I am feeling is anger at myself for not being able to save my comrades. A burning feeling as if I was going to ignite even this body.  So, this is my true anger, huh?  I’ve been called a changed child ever since I was a child.  I’ve been told that since I was a child, that I was quiet for a demonkin and that I was intelligent. Of course, she couldn’t be compared to people and elves.  But in demonkin who often moved based on their emotions, she was a quiet child.  She could get angry. But I may have never felt this strong in my life.  My weakness, my hatred!  Why am I so weak!?  Why can’t I protect my friends when all I do is big! This wooden doll stick!  It’s pointless!  </p>
<p>「Nuuuuuuuuuh!」</p>
<p>「Eh?  D-Donad-san?</p>
<p>「Ughaaaaaaaaah!」</p>
