</div><h1>Chapter 974</h1><p>The giant-type looked at us with an angry expression. Until now, the only person who seemed to have emotions were the commander, but I guess the giant-type, which was even more powerful than the commander, naturally had them. </p>
<p>「Ruaaaah!」</p>
<p>『Do you remember something stupid?』</p>
<p> The giant-type crouched down again to pick up the rubble. But this time, it was not the same as before. To our surprise, it grabbed the rubble with its left and right hands. The giant-type, which stood up vigorously in front of us, raised both hands at the same time. The giant-type, which stood up vigorously in front of our astonished eyes, raised both hands at the same time.  </p>
<p>「Ruaooourgh!」</p>
<p>  The giant-type twisted its face as if it was grinning, and began to swing only its left arms down. </p>
<p>『Did we plan to throw two bullets in a row by the time difference!?』</p>
<p>(Master, what do we do?)</p>
<p>『You just throw me!  Fran, you just have to lower your body a little and hit everyone directly』</p>
<p>(Okay!)</p>
<p>  Fran twisted her body as hard as she could and threw me at the left arm of the giant in a side throw form.  She accelerated super-accelerating with skills and magic, but it would still not do much damage. However, the main purpose of this attack was to close the distance. The closer we were, the more telekinesis could be affected.  </p>
<p>『First, telekinesis!』</p>
<p>  Just like before, I activated my telekinesis to hinder the throwing of the giant-type. The rock that the giant-type of shorz threw fell at its feet again.  However, this was not the end of the giant-type attack.  He used the momentum of his left arm to twist his body, and used the recoil to swing down his right arm even more forcefully this time.  His body’s performance was predictable! But I’ve predicted that!  I’m thinking of a way to deal with it! </p>
<p>『Self-destruction!』</p>
<p>「Rooom!」</p>
<p>  I then read the trajectory of the giant-type hand and opened the dimension gate in front of it. It was not difficult to predict since its movements were similar to those of a human.  I used the blessing of the Wizard skill, the God of Wisdom, to create the largest gate I could create.  It was probably more than ten meters in diameter. Even so, some of them had escaped from the space-time gate, but most of them had succeeded in swallowing it into the gate.  The paired gate was created right next to it. After all, it was right behind it. Countless pieces of rubble jumped out of the gate and pierced the back of the giant.  </p>
<p>「Ruuuuuh!」</p>
<p>『Sorry for trouble!』</p>
<p>「Ruaaaagh......!」</p>
<p>  Even if they have a tough body, they will be damaged if they are attacked by that powerful attack. A large number of rocks were thrust into his back, and magic power was leaking out of it.  It may not be a serious injury for him, but he seemed to be confused by the situation that he couldn’t understand. He is paying particular attention to the back.  In his attack and defense now, he grasped the timing of opening the Dimension Gate. Next time, I’ll build a gate even closer and return all of it to him.  That was what I had been thinking while looking at the giant-type that crouched down again.  However, the giant-types do not often get up. </p>
<p>『Yeah, what did you do while you’re still sitting――』</p>
<p>「Ruuuaaaaaaaaaah!」</p>
<p>『Wha!』</p>
<p>  With a tremendous crash, a tremendous torrent of magic power blew away the surroundings. I was safe as I had put up a barrier, but the area around the giant-type was like a crater.  I quickly looked up and saw that the body of the giant had jumped up. It wasn’t that it was picking up the debris, but that it had bent its legs to accumulate muscle and magic power. By using the power of that giant body combined with the momentum of his magic release, he was able to make a surprising jump.  He judged that throwing was not working well and switched to a direct attack.  The more annoying it was, the faster the changeover was!  The super huge body over 200 meters high was over its height. A huge shadow slowly licked the ground and blocked the sunlight above the head of the second unit.  That position was insane! </p>
<p>『Uoooooh!』</p>
<p>  I quickly teleported to the back of the giant and hit him with my wind magic. I tried to somehow divert its trajectory, but it didn’t do much to the giant-type, which was clad in magic barriers. However, there was no way anyone on land could do anything.  A zone of flames reminiscent of a dragon’s exhalation had been released into the giant-type in the air. Even the giant-type would not be able to block Isario’s attack.  The giant-type, whose left arm was burned as a shield, lost its balance in the air and was diverted from its original trajectory. It would fall at a considerable distance from us, but the giant-type was still badly injured at the time of its death.  Immediately after it fell from its stomach, it swung down its desperately extended right arm toward the second unit. The ground was shaken by the impact of the giant-type’s fall, and the second unit could not escape on the spur of the moment.  Its arms, which looked like high-rise buildings, were just barely reaching the second unit. I saw its giant palms crushing part of the second unit more than a large truck.  </p>
<p>「Guys!」</p>
<p>『Damn!』</p>
<p> We hurriedly returned to the second unit and gnashed at the extent of the damage.  There must have been more than 50 casualties, including adventurers and the old soldiers of the Militant Nation of Hagane.  There were about as many injured people as there.  </p>
<p>『We’re going to heal Fran!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  Fran was giving orders to hurry away while healing the soldiers. At this rate, the giant-types that were trying to get up might cause even more damage. Immediately afterward, I saw a red light rising just beside the giant who used his right arm to get up.  It was Isario.  I thought he had released his divine sword, but that doesn’t seem to be the case. He seemed to have released so much magic power in order to draw the attention of the giant.  </p>
<p>『Fran, move everyone within now!』</p>
<p>「Nn.  Guys, hurry up!」</p>
<p>  Even though it was hard hit, it was an elite unit. They immediately obeyed Fran’s orders and began to move with their injured friends on their backs.  Meanwhile, we saw the giant-type on its knees swinging its right hand toward Isario. But Isario was already gone by that time.  He had moved at high speed to avoid the giant-type attack.  He went around to the side and attacked with flames. Although it looked like a feint, the flames were from an S-ranked adventurer.  He had pierced through the giant-type defenses and was in a panic at the surface of his body. Although his regeneration began instantly, there was no doubt that some damage had been inflicted.  I could see that the Giant-type’s attention had shifted from the second unit to Isario. He had completely identified Isario as his prey.  </p>
<p>「I’ll prepare for the ritual magic while the Red lotus blade-dono is luring you!  The adventurers must first aid the injured!」</p>
<p>  Following your instructions, the survivors formed a formation. We formed a formation in front of them, and we were the ones in charge of defense.  </p>
<p>(We will no longer cause any damage.)</p>
<p>  Fran was ready to knead her magic and unleash her secret move at any time. The most difficult way would be to use the ritual magic of the Hagane Kingdom and have them stop with us and Isario.  It was too close to the town, but we couldn’t afford to take any more damage. We had no choice but to allow any damage.  Just when we had decided our departure and braced ourselves, Fran turned her head to the side.  We saw some kind of shadow flying in the western sky.  At first I thought it was a swarm of chickens, but it seems that is not the case. There are no such bigbirds on this continent.  </p>
<p>「Something’s flying!」</p>
<p>『Rocks!  Storage!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  It was countless rocks.  It was more than rubble, as if I had smashed and threw some rocks out of it. It had attacked us with more than twenty of them.  Who was it? I had been watching the movements of the giant-types for a long time.  It was not his work.  Then I saw something approaching us from a distance.  It was in human form, but it was not a person. It was too huge.</p>
<p>『There’s another giant-type!』</p>
