</div><h1>Chapter 1037</h1><p>Trismegistus’ castle was still in an accumulation of remnants of the castle. However, some of it had already been repaired. I saw the outer wall of the castle regenerate little by little. Its method of regeneration was rather unique. Fran was staring at it with interest. It didn’t rise little by little like a regeneration skill, nor did the rubble return to its original state as if it was inverted. First of all, a translucent wall that looked like a hologram was projected into the air. Then, I wondered if the hologram emitted a strong light, and in the next moment, the wall had acquired its physical form. And in the next moment, as if the hologm had emitted a strong light, the wall itself had acquired its physical form.  A hologm emerged from the regenerated wall again, and the wall was resurrected one after another. It was a very strange sight, even for me.  </p>
<p>「Hmm?  It’s shining over there」</p>
<p>「Around the place where the throne is?」</p>
<p>  We could also see light rising from the center of the pile of rubble. As Isario said, it was probably the place where the throne room used to be.  We decided to head there for the time being. We climbed over the pile of rubble and occasionally moved the rubble as we piled it up and used it as a foothold. After about ten minutes of climbing the rubble, the scenery in front of us changed completely.  In the center of the pile of rubble, there was a large space. It looked like a bowl and looked like a crater.  An unscathed throne sat in the center of it. Of course, there was also the figure of the Lord sitting on the throne. As we looked down from the rubble mountain, we immediately looked away with interest.  There was no ceiling, no walls, no floor, only the throne and the ground where it was placed. The only thing that surrounded us was the remains of the castle.  It was so ruinous that it looked so fitting for Trismegistus. It felt strangely fitting, as if I was the embodiment of the essence of this dragonkin. A tall king sat in the middle of the remnants of the castle.  </p>
<p>「...... So pathetic.」</p>
<p>「I’ll be careful not to become like that.」</p>
<p> Isario and Jayne must have felt something close to me. We went down a mountain of rubble and approached Trismegistus.  </p>
<p>「Is it Isario, Fran, or Jayne?  What did you need?」</p>
<p>「I need to go over a lot of things.」</p>
<p>「Very well. I’ll answer all your questions.」</p>
<p>To make matters worse, their attitudes were still the same. But I felt a terrifying sense of emptiness in it.  It was a similar atmosphere in the past.  A voice and expression that did not feel the warmth of a human being, like a machine. In fact, I had never seen this man get upset before, and I thought that his mind had worn out during his long life.  But now that I’ve seen Trismegistus, I can tell that it was better than before. What we were looking at was a dragonkin whose mind had become frayed and turned into a machine.  But what we saw in front of us was a real doll.  It was like a fresh golem created using the flesh of a living being. There was no heart in there, only a mechanical response. When it was explained that way, it was understandable. Can a person harbor such an empty feeling?  It wasn’t just Fran.  Everyone who came here paused because of an indescribable sense of fear and uneasiness.  Even Isario was holding his breath.  </p>
<p>『That sword...?』</p>
<p>(Juanaverta?)</p>
<p>『No.  It looks similar, but that’s it.』</p>
<p>  Trismegistus had a silver Falcion standing next to it.  But he looked different.  I couldn’t feel any presence, no power, no strange humanity. There was no heart in that sword.  Trismegistus must have noticed Fran’s strong gaze.  </p>
<p>「This is the perfected version of an intelligence weapon.  No unnecessary words, no unnecessary actions. It is a true intelligence weapon with extreme rationality and convenience」</p>
<p>  So, he’s saying that we don’t have to worry about losing Franaverta?  Was it because he pushed the boundaries of rationality that it was so good? Fran seemed to be concerned about the different parts.  </p>
<p>(... No)</p>
<p>『Fran?』</p>
<p>(That’s not the perfect form of an intelligence weapon! No way!)</p>
<p>  Fran turned her head down and repeated negative words in her mind.  Well, if I affirm Trismegistus’ words, I’m not going to be a mere imperfection. But I wonder if she’ll accept me.  </p>
<p>(It’s not because Master is strong, it’s because he can talk.  It’s because he can talk, it’s fun.  It’s reassuring to be able to talk. It’s not like it’s amazing at all)</p>
<p>『Fran...』</p>
<p>  It was a reaction of denial that could even feel hatred. Maybe he imagined me as a sword, and he seemed to have a negative feeling that he couldn’t control over the sword that reminded me of that image.  But he didn’t talk about it.  I guess he knew that it was useless to tell Trismegistus. Instead, he asked something else.  </p>
<p>「I heard that Juanaverta hadn’t gone crazy for a long time. Why?」</p>
<p>「... I had a skill to not go crazy.」</p>
<p>  It was unusual for this man, since he had a momentary pause. His golden eyes turned to Falcion of Silver and narrowed slightly.  However, soon after, Trismegistus replied with the same attitude as ever.  </p>
<p>「Skill?」</p>
<p>「Indeed.  It’s an Extra Skill called ‘Permanent Allegiance’.  It’s a skill that allows you to identify your Lord and swear to follow him for eternity.  In a sense, it can be said to enslave yourself. Instead, as long as the user exists, they can be a permanent indefinite being.」</p>
<p>  Does that mean they can be eternal as long as the user is alive? Moreover, he can’t die of age? </p>
<p>「You had that skill and yet you were defeated by the source of jealousy?」</p>
<p>「No.  Instead of obtaining the source of jealousy, you were deprived of your eternal loyalty.」</p>
<p> Oh, I see!  So you were easily defeated by the source of jealousy and turned into what you are today.  </p>
<p>「...... Who the ones who took that skill?」</p>
<p>  Fran was a little distressed and asked.  She didn’t want me to be Fran’s slave with that skill, but she didn’t want me to turn into a sword.  Well, let’s just get some clues for now.</p>
<p>「I don’t know his name, but he was a Divine Swordsman.」</p>
