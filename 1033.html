</div><h1>Chapter 1033</h1><p>『Phew.........』</p>
<p>The negative emotions that came from Juanaverta finally calmed down.</p>
<p>『I’m okay now』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Holding me in her arms, Fran glared at Trismegistus.</p>
<p>「Is this a reward?」</p>
<p>「Yeah」</p>
<p>He had lost his beloved sword――or his partner who had been with him for many years, but there was no sign of emotion in Trismegistus’ voice.</p>
<p>I lost my mind to be angry in the face of Trismegistus.</p>
<p>I felt sorry for him.</p>
<p>Juanaverta was easily 「unwanted」 by someone who had been working for him for many years, and Trismegistus was not grieving after losing his partner.</p>
<p>Her eyes were――no, were there just a little bit of emotional swings? There was still sadness in her eyes. Did she intervene before Juanaverta went completely crazy? Or was it just that my heart, which I wished she was, was showing that by Juanaverta’s emotions?</p>
<p>Fran seemed to have a similar thought, and her ears were drooping. The anger and killing intent she had been emitting earlier had disappeared, and she felt a strong sympathy for Trismegistus and Aurel.</p>
<p>She must have felt the fear of being so different from her. It was exactly an encounter with the unknown. The arms holding me were tightly tightened.</p>
<p>「We know that sword has the power of cannibalism. That’s why we transferred its power」</p>
<p>『Is it because of Juanaverta’s spare parts somewhere? Maybe she has backed up her memories?』</p>
<p>「Nothing like that.」</p>
<p>『Seriously......』</p>
<p>So, would this guy continue to be punished by the gods on his own for a long time to come? I know that is self-righteous, but that is――</p>
<p>Trismegistus, who had been answering our questions, suddenly blurted out.</p>
<p>「Th-the body is the limit, huh―?」</p>
<p>「You’ve disappeared?」</p>
<p>Suddenly, Trismegistus’ figure disappeared into the void. I guess it meant that the time limit for us to stay outside the barrier had come. At about the same time, Isario regained consciousness.</p>
<p>「Fran, huh...?」</p>
<p>「Isario, are you okay?」</p>
<p>「......I’m safer than I thought I would be. Why?」</p>
<p>『Trismegistus.』</p>
<p>I explained to him that Trismegistus had used the original sin of jealousy to save Isario.</p>
<p>After hearing that, he seemed to be convinced.</p>
<p>「I’m a valuable asset. I act just like him」</p>
<p>『I heard she took a few hours’ worth of time, but how about it?』</p>
<p>I checked Isario’s condition. He was still worn out and recoiled until we reached the castle, but it seemed that there was no problem. He had already woken up and could walk normally.</p>
<p>On the contrary, he said that the level he had fallen back was what should have been the price of using the Divine Sword.</p>
<p>This would make it even possible to fight. Let me hear from him about Trismegistus’ actions this time.</p>
<p>『Isario, what do you think you’ve done to Trismegistus?』</p>
<p>I don’t feel a sense of justice that would make me want to kill him. But I don’t have enough patience to forgive him for being a pitiful being.</p>
<p>I think we should kill him, but I can’t kill him. In the first place, if we were to confront him and interfere, there was even a possibility for punishment from the Gods. In the end, we could only just stand by and not do anything, right?</p>
<p>『I don’t know what to do with him anymore...』</p>
<p>「I know you’re tired, but we have no choice but to give up on the idea of him. Whatever we say, he’s still the same, and we can’t eliminate him. Besides, we’re the ones who broke into the barrier after all」</p>
<p>「They told me they couldn’t stay there except those who could fight.」</p>
<p>「That too, is one truth.」</p>
<p>『But we need people who can produce in order to keep fighting, right? We need a town to do that, and if people gather, children will be born and the town will expand』</p>
<p>Certainly, Trismegistus may find it meaningless for many people. However, there were blacksmiths, alchemists, and cooks who fought within the barrier, so I wonder if such a presence was necessary for a dragonkin to keep fighting within the barrier.</p>
<p>「Trismegistus doesn’t need to be replenished, so the dragonkin could enter through the barrier. I guess that means they shouldn’t have an absolute reason for building a stronghold inside the barrier. Instead, they decided that it would be more disadvantageous to have more people living inside the barrier and keep their power being sucked out」</p>
<p>Originally, this was the land for Trismegistus and the dragonkin to atone for their sins. Moreover, he warned them not to enter unless the gods were capable of fighting.</p>
<p>If you interfere with them, they might be eliminated. If you can freely enter the barrier, you must accept it and live.</p>
<p>「Just think of it as a natural disaster, Trismegistus and antidemons alike. That’s why we can’t do it on this continent.」</p>
<p>『......Maybe that’s true. But I......』</p>
<p>「That’s fine. It’s over once you’re comfortable splitting up. Just like me.」</p>
<p>Isario laughed in self-mockery. He’s nowhere near as dang strong as he sounds. But he won’t be able to survive on this continent unless we divide him up.</p>
<p>I guess that was why he was telling himself that he had decided to break free.</p>
<p>『So he’ll win by himself in the end?』</p>
<p>「......There is no doubt that this incident has greatly reduced the power of the Abyss Eater. If someone like you were to leave, the world would be destroyed. It may not sound good to say it, but it has helped us to make a contribution to the world. That’s what I have to say」</p>
<p>『Yeah, yeah... Besides, I’ve lost my Juanaverta. I can’t say it’s a victory.』</p>
<p>As I sighed fidgetly, I saw a person running toward us.</p>
<p>「Isario, Fran! Are you okay!?」</p>
<p>「Will the girls be okay too?」</p>
<p>「Yeah!」</p>
<p>It was Mea. Apparently, everyone else was able to move now.</p>
<p>The battle had been raging since the fall of the sphere-shaped dragonkin, but I guess they managed to get everyone alive. They spontaneously gathered around Isario’s location.</p>
<p>All of them were in tatters. Even the armor worn by Orfalve was made of dwarven armor.</p>
<p>Sophie was transported by Urushi and Ashwrath, who was carried by two adventurers, had not woken up yet.</p>
<p>And the number of them had decreased too. I guess it was less than half of the first one, regardless of whether they were adventurers, soldiers, or knights.</p>
<p>Still, the giant antidemons were defeated and the crisis was over. Many were mourning for their deaths while biting their victory.</p>
<p>Also, there was no sign of the Holy Nation. Apparently, they withdrew on their own. Well, it would have been useless if those guys didn’t have Ader, so I don’t mind...</p>
<p>I was born several decades ago, it seems. Not that it means much to me considering how I don’t remember living that long myself.</p>
<p>We’d like to leave as well, but this would not be enough to “yes”. This army was already investigating the antidemons’ anomalies.</p>
<p>The relatively energetic Orfalve, Isario, and the knight chief of Silard who had just returned, Seliadot, who seemed to know what was going on, had gathered and was discussing the future. It would be quickest to talk to Trismegistus, but we had a hostile response once.</p>
<p>Well, I think he’s not completely concerned about that matter, but there was a possibility that he would suddenly fight for a reason that we didn’t understand.</p>
<p>When their goal was achieved, they would be able to say it was well-behaved without any hostility or goodwill.</p>
<p>Like I thought, Trismegistus really didn’t like me. If at all possible, I didn’t want to see him for a while. I need time to accept this feeling.</p>
<p>Fran probably hated him even more than me. He didn’t try to directly touch him, but he was involved in a incident where many people died and tried to destroy me. It was not so much that he said, “I won’t forgive you, I’ll spend my life destroying you!” But I was sure she hated him to the extent that she could feel angry when she looked at him.</p>
<p>As I was thinking about this, Fran and Isario suddenly looked up to the sky. I was also well aware of the anomaly, right?</p>
<p>There was powerful magic power swirling far above us.</p>
<p>「What’s that?」</p>
<p>「Oi oi, that was... Divine Power?」</p>
<p>Then the light suddenly faded.</p>
