</div><h1>Chapter 939</h1><p>After separating from Jayne and the others, Fran returned to the Adventurers Guild to obtain information on the Holy Nation of Silard and the Kingdom of Hagane.</p>
<p>The queen duo had told us a lot about both countries, but I didn’t even know why they came to this town.</p>
<p>If we were to fight around here, we might be able to see the activation of the Divine Sword.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the Adventurers Guild, we found no holy knights or soldiers. Did they leave already?</p>
<p>I stepped inside to try to call out to the adventurers. But before we could do so, the woman at the reception desk approached us first.</p>
<p>「Black Lightning Princess-sama! So, you’re now back! I heard that the guildmaster has something to discuss, so can you ask the office for it?」</p>
<p>「Guildmaster’s room?」</p>
<p>「We’ll leave it to you」</p>
<p>「...Okay」</p>
<p>She had been waiting for Fran. It would be too early to talk to the guildmaster directly, so we would follow her lead. The reason why Fran hesitated slightly was probably that she was not very good with that sex appeal Mungial master.</p>
<p>We took a slightly heavy step towards Guild Master’s room, and there, we found several men and women waiting for us, aside from the Guild Master.</p>
<p>One of them was the reliable submaster, Dandism. With him, we can handle Replare’s outbursts.</p>
<p>Isario was also sitting on the couch, drinking and occupying the three-person couch in front of the guild master alone.</p>
<p>So this is a Rank S adventurer huh...? Well, maybe Fran is the same type as me when she starts eating in front of important people though?</p>
<p>Well, it was reassuring to know someone I knew.</p>
<p>The only problem was probably the other two. One of them was sitting on the chair on the right side of the sofa where the guildmasters sat, and the other was using a chair on the left side, which was the opposite. The holy knight of the guards stood behind the man on the left. He seemed not to be the wielder of the divine sword because of the intimidation he felt.</p>
<p>There was a tension between the two that made it easy to see at a glance how badly they were getting along. They never looked at each other, but they were very conscious of each other.</p>
<p>I’d never seen either of them, but I could tell which one they belonged to at a glance. If I knew that I was going to meet them here, I would have refused.</p>
<p>「I was thinking of calling him later, but he just came to the right place」</p>
<p>「Come on, take your seat there」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran stared sideways at the holy knight in front of the submaster and sat down next to Isario. The smell of alcohol was probably better than next to the others.</p>
<p>After confirming that Fran had sat down, the submaster opened his mouth.</p>
<p>「First, let me introduce you to these guys. The person sitting beside Black Lightning Princess-dono is an S-Ranked adventurer――」</p>
<p>「It’s Isario the incompetent. Well, look again at me, young miss.」</p>
<p>「You should do that again......」</p>
<p>「I don’t know how many names I would give myself. The stylish name of a red lotus blade that ignited flames is not a good match for me. A man like me looks good without talent」</p>
<p>Isario shrugged in response to the submaster’s vindictive stare. His tone of voice showed that he was neither humble nor embarrassed.</p>
<p>Isario seriously thought that the alias “incompetent” was a good fit for him.</p>
<p>Fran tilted her head in confusion. After all, she must have thought that the alias of an S-Ranked adventurer was “Unskilled”.</p>
<p>「Why are you insane?」</p>
<p>「Haha, I like that a lot」</p>
<p>「Hmm」</p>
<p>Fran didn’t dig any deeper. If he had liked it, she must have thought that it was inevitable.</p>
<p>The submasters apparently wanted her to give her a stronger alias than I had hoped for. After all, she was a Rank S adventurer, the top of all adventurers.</p>
<p>It was not a joke that such a person had a strange name for himself, but rather the morale of an adventurer. But Isario had heard the tempest was coming from somewhere.</p>
<p>「Come on, I’m currently in the middle of introducing you, right?」</p>
<p>「I-is that so? I’m sorry. The man sitting on that side is the Knight of Silard. He is the head of an organization called the Divine Swords Department that administers the divine swords, and he is the highest ranked in the world」</p>
<p>「I’ll be in your care」</p>
<p>「And behind it is the current Divine Sword Knight」</p>
<p>「What is this Divine Sword Knight!?」</p>
<p>Fran asked back with a look of surprise. Then the guard nodded again with a smile.</p>
<p>「Hello young miss, I’m Adors, the Divine Sword Knight of my generation. Do you know him?」</p>
<p>The man who seemed to be her escort was Adors Yaresfeim, the Divine Sword Knight, the wielder of the Divine Sword Alpha. At first glance, he looked like a refreshing figure. If he hadn’t hadn’t been in contact with Filuria, they might have believed him.</p>
<p>But was this man really a Divine Sword Knight? He was strong enough to be strong. But considering that he was the wielder of the Divine Sword, I felt a shortage.</p>
<p>Moreover, it didn’t seem to have a Divine Sword. To be honest, I was really suspicious or the wielder of the Divine Sword at this point.</p>
<p>In that case, he was probably much weaker than Zefmate in his current state.</p>
<p>Fran was surprised not only by her status as a Divine Sword Knight, but also by her lack of ability to meet that title.</p>
<p>However, Fran could now make such a judgment by suppressing her expression and bowing her head.</p>
<p>「I’m Fran, a B-ranked adventurer」</p>
<p>「I’ve heard from Replare-dono, that you’re a wonderful adventurer. It’s an honor to meet you. I heard that Sendia’s defense was a fierce battle that surpassed even anyone’s.」</p>
<p>「Nn. There were hundreds of thousands of antidemons.」</p>
<p>「That’s amazing! It’s like the holy knights in our country fought in Sendia and lost their lives. But I agree with you, since there are so many antidemons out there.」</p>
<p>There’s no lie in Adel’s words. Apparently, the scum-filled knights had been killed by antidemons before they returned to their main force.</p>
<p>Honestly, I felt a great sense of gratitude. This would have prevented the worst from happening, with the holy knights looking at us as enemies.</p>
<p>I’d like to question her about our relationship with Filuria, but I’d like to say no to the bushes snake. Let’s just say hello for now.</p>
<p>「And the one sitting on that side is the commander of the troops of General Hagane.」</p>
<p>「Nice to meet you, Black Lightning Princess-dono. My name is Shiki. I am in charge of commanding this expeditionary force.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Nice to meet you」</p>
<p>It was a very neutral person who bowed her head. I think she was probably a woman, but at first glance she looked like a handsome young prince.</p>
<p>I wonder if you’re stronger than Ader? But isn’t the Divine Sword’s wielder the commander? The Divine Sword Berserk possessed by General Hagane was supposed to kill the wielder. So, it must not be the type of weapon that the commander uses.</p>
<p>「Eventually, I’d like to have a talk with her slowly」</p>
<p>「Nn. I want to ask you a lot of questions too」</p>
<p>「Fufufu, thank you in advance for your assistance.」</p>
<p>I don’t feel any hostility, but I can’t read their intentions. At first glance, they seem friendly, but in reality, they seem to be the type of person who can’t――.</p>
<p>In fact, we might have to be most vigilant.</p>
