</div><h1>Chapter 912</h1><p>Thanks to Mea and Zelos Reed’s participation, our front became much more stable. Although we were chipping away at the antidemons, Sophie’s recovery had helped us minimize our backs.</p>
<p>They were able to continue fighting without a hitch, even when their enemies were only higher ranked, the jet-black type.</p>
<p>Fran and Mea’s black-and-white duo will use high-level coordination to crush antidemons and maintain their front. Velmeria and Zefmate will protect both sides.</p>
<p>Velmeria was flying around at high speeds in the air, striking antidemons with water magic and spears.</p>
<p>The speed was so fast that an afterimage was created. Moreover, by releasing magic power from its wings, it was possible to reach the maximum speed in an instant. The speed of the wings was so fast that I was impressed by how freely they moved.</p>
<p>It was also excellent in terms of defense, with scales all over its body repelling the antidemons’ attacks. Like I thought, it did not look like it was dragonizing, but it seemed to be able to do something similar to turning only a part of its body into a dragon.</p>
<p>Fran used to have an overwhelming victory in the mock battle, but now it’s not going to be easy for her to win.</p>
<p>Zefmate had also evolved at a surprising rate. Aah, that doesn’t mean he has evolved as a Beastman. Well, the way he uses his unique skills was completely different from before, at the level that I think he has really evolved one more time and learned a different unique skill.</p>
<p>The blue leopards, the evolution of the blue cats, were endemic to the skill called the leopard’s leg. It must have been a skill that combined increased speed with aerial jump.</p>
<p>In fact, Zefmate, whom we had fought before, was good at high-speed maneuvering by using his leopard leg skill.</p>
<p>Of course, she was still moving at high speeds in the same way as before. However, the number of moves she took was not as great as before.</p>
<p>『Double swords alone are certainly evil at that speed.』</p>
<p>(Did they kick it?)</p>
<p>『Yeah. I’m gonna use my leopard legs for attacking him』</p>
<p>Zefmate, who had been fighting with twin swords before, was even able to use martial arts now.</p>
<p>It looked like he had a leopard leg on a kick, and the antidemon was slain in two. A high kick knock knock knocked him off his head, allowing his body to snap vertically. The antidemon was slaughtered every time he flashed a blue magic-powered footsword.</p>
<p>Moreover, his movements were not as linear as before. He was spinning his body up, down, left, right, and left, and it was very tricky. Not only was he moving like a spun skater, but he also used a lot of sideways and capoeil movements.</p>
<p>Using this speed, she unleashes both her legs and twin swords at once.</p>
<p>Simple calculation, the number of hits was twice as many as before. Moreover, the destructive power due to the turn and the hit rate due to the tricky nature have increased dramatically.</p>
<p>Her fighting style had changed to such an extent that she could no longer be called a separate person from Zefmate when she fought him in the martial arts tournament.</p>
<p>I had thought before that the blue cat’s leopard skill was a backwards version of the Black Heavenly Tiger’s Brilliant Lightning Rush. That was probably why the blue cats hated the black cats.</p>
<p>But now that I’ve seen Zefmate’s skill, I can tell that I was wrong. His leash was a skill that integrated offense and defense, and attacking was probably my main goal.</p>
<p>The skill that increased the power of the kicks could also be used to move around. That was how it seemed.</p>
<p>Still, I’m doubtful that Zefmate couldn’t make full use of it in the past...... I wonder if the blue cats don’t have the know-how to make full use of their leopard legs?</p>
<p>「Zefmate is very strong」</p>
<p>Fran looked at Zefmate with excitement. The blood of a battle junkie must have pained her in the eyes of his strength.</p>
<p>In other words, she has become strong enough to make Fran want to have a mock battle with him. Maybe she will be able to have a good match with Colbert?</p>
<p>Velmeria and Zefmate, who had grown and become stronger, were as reliable as Mea.</p>
<p>Behind Fran and the others, the Beastmen Union’s troops laid out a line of defense, but there were almost no antidemons flowing through them.</p>
<p>Fran and Urushi’s morale got boosted when their friends came to the rescue, and they no longer felt like they could lose.</p>
<p>As we continued to fight, at last an enemy captain appeared in front of us.</p>
<p>He was a red horned knight with four guards guarding the commander of Castel, and a larger body than usual standing in the center of it.</p>
<p>「I will take over my commander. I beg you all to remain silent.」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Fran followed Mea’s words and pointed her sword at the vanguard-type. Not only did she realize that she was not at full power, but she also wanted to see how much Mea had grown.</p>
<p>However, the results were very different from what we had imagined for the next round.</p>
<p>Compared to the antidemons we fought at Castel, this one was a little more powerful, and not nearly as powerful as an enemy.</p>
<p>If Fran and the others were serious, the vanguard-type would be defeated in an instant. And the large red horned knights were also much inferior to the special individuals that were the boss of Castel.</p>
<p>In front of Mea, who had awakened and was clad in gold and white fire, she turned into ashes in less than a minute and disappeared. I guess that’s a good feeling too.</p>
<p>「Hmm, I guess she’s at least used to being able to do some exercise」</p>
<p>「Mea, so cool」</p>
<p>「Fuhahaha! Of course!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Urushi did his best too」</p>
<p>「Indeed! You have become even stronger! I was surprised too, Urushi!」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>The antidemons were still around, and Fran and Urushi were continuing to fight. However, their pressure on them had decreased to the point that they were short on chatting.</p>
<p>We’ll end up wiping out the rest.</p>
<p>I wondered what would happen, but as a result, it did not cause any damage――</p>
<p>『!! A newbie huh!?』</p>
<p>「Amazing speed.」</p>
<p>Just when we were relieved, we caught the sight of a newbie. They were surprisingly fast, probably nearly ten times faster than the speed of antidemons in the past.</p>
<p>At this rate, we’ll reach this city in less than five minutes.</p>
<p>And the depth of their presence. They seemed to be numerous in number. Could it be that even the antidemons we had been engaged in fierce battles with were our advance party?</p>
<p>Mea and Zelos Reed were also staring at the east, where the presence of antidemons was evident, with grim faces.</p>
<p>A new kind of despair was about to come over us.</p>
