</div><h1>Chapter 987</h1><p>『Ahhhhh......』</p>
<p>「I’m glad we escaped.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「W-woof......」</p>
<p> The antidemon dragonkin stiffened with their backs to their stance at a distance, but Fran swung down Berserk. A large amount of jet-black magic power enveloping the divine sword overflowed, covering the earth with a tsunami-like force. The black tsunami then rushed over a wide area, trying to swallow the antidemon dragonkin. We thought it would be a bad idea if we didn’t escape, but it stopped moving after about 400 meters. We thought it would be a bad idea to run away too, but the black tsunami stopped moving after about 400 meters.  But if we had remained on the battlefield, we might have been caught up in it.  If there was still reason in the battle, they might have been holding back, but I don’t even know how the release of Berserk would affect their mind. He avoided the troops of the Militant Nation of Hagane, but it was unknown if they would attack even the adventurers with them off.  </p>
<p>「I can’t see any sign of the antidemon dragonkin.」</p>
<p>「Yeah.  I don’t feel them either.  They’re gonna attack us if we get swallowed up, right? terrifying......」</p>
<p>  After the black tsunami with no sound pulled back, there was nothing alive there.  It wasn’t just the antidemon dragonkin who lost their lives.  The grass and trees that grew sparsely, and the presence of small insects that could be faintly detected, were all gone.  After all, after Berserk was liberated, Maste‍rno was capable of impromptu death. No, from the point of view of fighting giant dragonkin, it was not an instant death. In addition, he canceled out the explosion of ball-type antidemon dragonkin to prevent their impact.  No matter what kind of person they were, they could kill their power. Maybe that’s a power that is not within the realm of such skills.  </p>
<p>「Morning Slayer!」</p>
<p> Fran, who had been staring at the battlefield with a stifling spit, let out a sad shout.  </p>
<p>『Ah!  Fran!  Urushi, I’ll leave the adventurers to you!』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  Fran had found the falling Songpan, and she was unconsciously running away. She was strangely concerned about it, even though she had never talked to the Hydrangea before.  She had heard what was going on with the young beauty from the Silver Lady and thought about it.  She had no intention of pity for Fran. However, I couldn’t help but feel something.  I couldn’t already feel Berserk’s vicious magic power. It seemed that his power was less than before the sword was released.  Did the release of the Divine Sword exhaust Berserk’s power?  If so, they might not be able to use it continuously in a short period of time. Well, it was unlikely that he would use Berserk in succession.  But when Fran arrived at the Sanatorium, the hydrangea had already picked her up. Survivors of the old soldiers were frozen around her. They looked as if they were escorting beautiful women below the moon without expression as usual.  But upon closer inspection, the old men’s eyes were red. Some of them were suppressing their sores and others were trembling slightly when they gripped their spears.  When I heard about the sheaths, I had a nasty idea.  Sheaths only took effect after the soldiers of the Kingdom of Hagane had suffered some damage to some extent. In other words, they were sacrificed to the old people.  When I thought about the beauty of the younger generation, it seemed that the Militant Nation of Hagane did not hesitate to use up its people. It was not impossible.  However, from the looks of the old people grieving for the death of the Great Magic Beast, I couldn’t imagine what was going on behind the scenes as if they were being sacrificed. I thought about it in the previous battles, but these old people could feel the strength of those who were fighting on their own volition.  The atmosphere of the situation was heavy.  </p>
<p>「Must have been snowing」</p>
<p>「Black Lightning Princess-san, right? I’m glad you didn’t get caught in this」</p>
<p>  I didn’t ask them if they were okay. The reason why the light of life of the Great Magic Beast was already about to go out was because it was obvious to everyone’s eyes.  They didn’t seem to be holding their breath, but their skin and hair were dull and had dark spots under their eyes.  However, they had lost their life force. She must have thought that she couldn’t take away her last time. </p>
<p>「Thank you」</p>
<p>「I’m very happy because I didn’t expect anyone other than our country to thank us」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>「Hydrangea」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>「It wasn’t surprisingly bad for me to die...  I know why the Onee-sama died smiling. I know now...」</p>
<p>  She turned her eyes on the old soldiers, who were already doubtful whether she could see them or not. </p>
<p>「Mazyuki.  Good night」</p>
<p>「Fufu...  Take a break.  I think you’ve got a good dream...」</p>
<p>  While her sister, the Hydrangea, stroked her hair, the Masteyuku slowly closed her eyes. And the girl, the Divine Sword user, who had saved Fran and Urushi, went to sleep for a long time with a peaceful look on her face.  </p>
<p>「Black Lightning Princess, an adventurer.  Why are you crying?」</p>
<p>「... I don’t know」</p>
<p>「I see」</p>
<p>「Ajisai, are you okay?」</p>
<p>「No problem.  This is our mission.  Besides, she’s sleeping happily. That’s why I’m fine」</p>
<p>  As the hydrangea said, the tree seemed to be asleep. But her eyes never opened again.  Thanks to the tree, she had saved her life.  It would not be an exaggeration to say that she had saved her.  She was the debt of gratitude not only to Fran but also to all the adventurers.</p>
<p>『Thank you very much』</p>
