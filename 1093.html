</div><h1>Chapter 1093</h1><p>A few days after we opened the item bag, we deposited the documents we found with Gwad. He had used his guildmaster’s authority to send them directly to the King. This would not mean they would crush us out of bad hands. Today was our final day in Barbra. The government sent soldiers and other civilians to finish the job. They had been building up a field for the past few days. Not only had they repaired the land that had been crushed by the bombardment, but they also re-established the areas where houses and other things had been crushed and turned into empty areas. Not only had we repaired the land that had been crushed by the bombardment, but we also re-established the areas that had been crushed and turned into empty lots.  Of course, we didn’t do it on our own, but it was a request from the lord.  He said that now that they were in a state of war, they wanted to get as much food as possible on their own. Just because there was the meat of a mountain dragon would probably make them nutritious.  They planted a variety of vegetables that could be grown in a short period of time, similar to the twenty-day radishes. The taste was subtle, but the nutritional value seemed to be mediocre.  In fact, I’ve even raised my Tree Magic to Lv4. I wanted to try a spell called the Grow Plant, which allows me to grow plants rapidly.  Twenty-day radishes were harvested in just three days.  Even I had grown them, their growth rate was a little back. The farmers who helped us were also scared of it.  Moreover, it seemed that the growth was faster, but the taste was messed up.  So, if they were forced to grow it, the backlash would come out. Fran would have become silent.  But she managed to cover it up by putting it in curry! Fran was displeased for being blasphemy about the curry, but the residents smiled as they ate it.  For the time being, they had harvested a good amount of food, so they must have been able to secure enough food for a few days. They continued to use tree magic until I had enough magic power.  It was only a few days’ worth of cooking in a big city like Barbra, and it tasted good, but I’m sure Felmus and the other guild members would be able to do something about it. The taste was good, but Fermus and the other cooks at the guild must be able to do something about it.  They could mix it up with wild dragon meat and cover it up.  The lord asked me if I could ask them to keep doing this, but Fran refused. I guess it’s not suited for her to continue the work.  But I didn’t mind it.  The work of transforming into a wavy mode and creating a field with land magic and water magic was unexpectedly interesting.  Besides, I once made a field in the game when I was a human being. It was a rare experience for me to remember a little bit of that and feel uncomfortable.  Well, I soon realized that it was not the right work for Fran.  It was the same for gathering medicinal herbs, but Fran was not very good at the same process of repeating it. She didn’t mind the slightest hint of her sword.  But before that, she had to make the last dish.  If Fran was going to give it away at Barbra, that would be the only way.  </p>
<p>「Dragon Restaurant and the Black Tail Pavilion, their combined dish, Dragon Restaurant Curry!」</p>
<p>「It’s delicious!  Doooh!」</p>
<p>「Let’s give it away for free!」</p>
<p>  At each place in Barbra, we asked the receptionists of the Adventurer’s Guild to help us distribute the curry. Moreover, as the receptionists said, it was a special curry made in cooperation with Felmus. It was a serious curry made with Yama Dragon’s meat that Felmus had dismantled and the spices I had blended with the soup stock he made from his dragon bones.  Fran was still able to make three plates of it silently. They were using dragon meat, and Felmus and I were getting serious. They were serving it outside of here, but it seemed to be a great success everywhere.  </p>
<p>「Hey.  You’re the kid at the Black Tail Stall, right?」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>「Thank you for the meal again!」</p>
<p>「Thank you very much for your help!」</p>
<p>「It really is a great help!」</p>
<p>  They handed out the curry bread during the previous incident, but many of them remembered that time.  They bowed their heads many times and asked to shake their hands many times. This time it was especially bad for free, so I guess they would be even more grateful to us.  Apparently, Gamud had helped Fran earn some points. Before I knew it, he was being treated as a hearty, black cat girl who had hunted dragons for Barbra and handed them out for free.  It was just too much fun, but it was not enough to deny it...  In the end, she just left it like that. Fran seemed a little annoyed though. But please forgive her because we will serve a good curry for her.  After Fran finished distribution of everything, she was eating curry from the rooftop of the guild, looking down at the square. There was a strong sense of anger on Fran’s face as she stared at the people, her legs plattered.  Seeing the smiles on people’s faces, I think she was angry with the Kingdom of Raidos again. However, it was Urushi, who ate the curry next to her, who calmed down Fran’s uneasy feelings.  </p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p> As promised, they are now all-you-can-eat super-spicy curry.  Even Fran would have already eaten a bowl of bright red curry that was satisfying with just one plate.  The mouth is bright red, but she has given up on cleansing it anymore. It will get dirty with curry from the corners of her body, so it’s best to wash it off at once after finishing it.  It seems that she was poisoned when she saw Urushi chewing the curry in a good mood while swinging his tail. Fran smiled slightly and stroked his body.  </p>
<p>『Fran.  I’ve got over 200 self-evolution points.  Is there a skill I want to raise my level? Now I’m free to raise it, okay?』</p>
<p>「Ooh, then, curse magic and purification magic!」</p>
<p>『Both of them have nothing to do with the battle, are they okay?』</p>
<p>「Nn! With those two, I can save those who are being enslaved!」</p>
<p>『I see.  Okay!  Let’s Kanst the Cursed Magic and Purification Magic!』</p>
<p>《Cursing Magic has reached LvMax.  A curse enhancement has been added to my skill. Even if I managed to Kant two skills, I still have about 200 self-evolution points. I could also let Fran Kant use the other magic spells, but I don’t think she could master them even if her skill level was too high.  So, I guess we should spend some time and increase it little by little.  </p>
<p>『Fran.  I managed to Kant the Cursing Magic, but don’t try to force it.  I’ll definitely free anyone Fran wants to help. Okay?』</p>
<p>「Nn.I’ll answer recklessly when push comes to shove!</p>
