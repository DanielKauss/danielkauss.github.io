</div><h1>Chapter 1129</h1><p>This was not good.</p>
<p>We’ll lose this battle if we continue like this. I, who was watching the battlefield from a bird’s-eye view with my magic sword, could clearly see the flow of events.</p>
<p>There was an undead that appeared from behind, the red knights that had dashed out of the fort, and the surprise attack unit that appeared out of nowhere and attacked our right wing, as if to mock our swarm.</p>
<p>The left side that opened up must be in a trap too. It was trying to guide us into that side. I knocked its sword away and searched for it, but I could feel a huge amount of magic power emanating from under the earth.</p>
<p>We should go back to support them, but the squadrons were also under attack. They were undead too.</p>
<p>There were quite high-ranking necromancers in the enemy army. The undead were quite strong.</p>
<p>I’ve reduced the number of antidemons by a lot with my ability, but I can’t shoot swords over a wide area in a disorderly brawl.</p>
<p>It was not a time to save our strength for the future. We had to use one of our trump cards right now.</p>
<p>「Jig. My trump card.」</p>
<p>「Forrund’s husband......! Got it!」</p>
<p>「Yeah」</p>
<p>「Oi oi! Take your husband’s sword!」</p>
<p>I told the C-Ranked adventurer, Zig, who was doing something like my second-in-command, to cut something too. He knew how to move with that, which was very useful.</p>
<p>Jig quickly told the adventurers about his plans for the future, and I activated my Sword God’s Favor with all my might.</p>
<p>I saw various swords appearing in front of the adventurers assigned to the mercenary brigade. This was one of my secret techniques, the prolonged embodiment of the sword.</p>
<p>Notes: I got an issue with my editor, he hasn’t done anything on his part for these past ten days, and this is the last chapter he has edited. He’s miraculously back! XD</p>
<p>But it was not that she couldn’t. By making countless swords into reality as it was now and letting them be used by her comrades, she could strengthen her forces at once. By doing so, she was able to increase the fighting power of the entire unit and increase the survival rate of everyone.</p>
<p>Those who picked up my sword were then enveloped in magic. I focused on the sword that had the power to increase my status and heal me.</p>
<p>Even if they couldn’t use the sword, just being equipped was enough to do this.</p>
<p>Instead, it will take a lot of my magic power. After this battle, my fighting power will be greatly reduced for a while. But that’s only possible if I survive.</p>
<p>「Let’s go」</p>
<p>「Don’t lie to me, bastards! You dare insult me!」</p>
<p>「「「「Woooh!」」」」</p>
<p>Leading the adventurers clad in colorful mana, I leapt into an undead army. I swung my purification swords in both hands and cut down the undead.</p>
<p>Quite a bit of time had passed when we defeated the undead army, especially the Adventurers Guild. The damage was also considerable.</p>
<p>The knights that were accompanying us in particular must have inflicted close to a hundred casualties.</p>
<p>But it is too dangerous to divide our forces here. We must go to the rescue of our main forces while protecting the wounded.</p>
<p>So this was what they were after? Anyway, we were way too late. We should join up with our main forces and leave the battlefield together.</p>
<p>As we continued further with that thought, we bumped into the knights in the red armor. The red knights, the guardians of the Raidos Kingdom, didn’t expect us to be that strong.</p>
<p>The adventurers equipped with my swords were being pushed forward. Moreover, the young man in charge of the knight order was unbelievably strong.</p>
<p>「Hahaha! Burn with fire! Those shitty bastards from Kranzel!」</p>
<p>He was probably about twenty years old. The young man looked like a magician who carefully patted his blue hair, and fortunately, he managed to shake off our forces. His magic was powerful and his melee combat skills were quite impressive. Moreover, he seemed to have special skills to strengthen the red knights.</p>
<p>The red knights’ armor was now enveloped in flames, and their attack and defense had increased. Moreover, they seemed to have an effect of blocking fire, so the knights were calm even when caught in flame magic.</p>
<p>Because of this, flame magic was shot at a wide area without any change, causing damage only to us. And just like that, the red knights were able to break through the chaos in their formation.</p>
<p>And if we don’t get rid of that young man, we won’t stop this flow.</p>
<p>I slashed at the young man to cancel my chanting. But I was blocked by the barrier of fire that suddenly burned.</p>
<p>「So you call her an advanced adventurer that you didn’t notice until you were so close?」</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>「You mean to say that you have no intention of giving us any information? Hmm, do you mean that some small fry are better?」</p>
<p>This was useful for times like this when I wasn’t very good at talking. I then held up my sword against an opponent I admired on my own.</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>「Then die without saying anything!」</p>
<p>He looked down on us, but he didn’t force Fran to slash at him. Despite his arrogant tone, he seemed to understand that she was at a disadvantage in melee combat.</p>
<p>At the same time, I activated a series of flame magic attacks. No chanting, and multiple activations. I quickly created a magic sword with flame resistance and repelled it.</p>
<p>「Sigh? What the hell is that! You’re so cheeky about that weakling’s habit! Burn it up!」</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>「Tch! How silent you are! Damn!」</p>
<p>He was a very skilled magician. He could release high-level magic without pause. The flame resistance of his magic sword was also not a complete nullification. It would be dangerous if he were to continuously be hit by magic of that level.</p>
<p>A stalemate. No, I still had some leeway on my way, but I was already close to the limit. By lending my comrades a hundred magic swords, I was continuing to use my magic power.</p>
<p>If we deactivated the incarnation temporarily, there was a possibility that we would be able to defeat the young man with a saturating attack of the sword. However, our friends would be invaded by the Red Knights instead. We had no choice but to keep it up.</p>
<p>「Come on! Come on! Fight back!」</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>「What a boring asshole!」</p>
<p>Fine. I’ll ride on that provocation then.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I saw me coming forward with my black sword outstretched, and I saw a slight wavering on the young man’s face.</p>
<p>They probably didn’t expect me to get on with the provocation to irritate us. Moreover, they ignored their boasting fire magic and began to thin their flesh.</p>
<p>I quickly tried to use the Flame Sword in my hand to defend against it, but my Black Sword extinguished the Flame Sword. This Magic Sword was a hungry magic sword, a magic sword that ate and disappeared everything in existence.</p>
<p>Instead, she ate my magic, physical, and life force at the same time. Even I, who was often ridiculed for my recklessness, was one of the forbidden people who could not use it.</p>
<p>But even when he used it, it did not reach the young man. He had somehow turned himself into fire and instantly distanced himself from them as if he was teleporting.</p>
<p>Since we’ve considerably reduced our magic power, it doesn’t seem to be a technique that can be used in rapid succession, but I don’t think we can catch it even if we continue to follow it. Do I have to play the last trump card for this? It would be my life expectancy if I lost my friends here――.</p>
<p>「Muh?」</p>
<p>「What? That’s...!」</p>
<p>What the hell is that?</p>
<p>Just like the young man, I was surprised.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just me. A white light enveloped all the adventurers. I could see that it was not a bad thing. It clearly had the power to protect them. In fact, the wounds we had inflicted were gradually healing.</p>
<p>What in the world was going on?</p>
<p>Just as the white light and confusion spread to the battlefield at the same time, black lightning poured down on the battlefield.</p>
<p>「Forrund! Are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Yeah」</p>
<p>The adventurers cheered for the reinforcements we had been waiting for. They saw a black cat girl riding a giant wolf. But I was as confused as they were joy.</p>
<p>「My priestess! Leave the undead to me!」</p>
<p>「Nn. Please」</p>
<p>As if to follow Fran, ghouls clad in vicious evil spirits appeared. Who are they?</p>
