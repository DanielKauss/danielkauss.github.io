</div><h1>Chapter 1034</h1><p>I saw a light raining down from above. It was emitting an sinisterly powerful divine attribute. Gradually, the light outlines and becomes sphere-shaped. It was a large ball of light that emitted a dazzling light. I braced myself for a moment, but others were unable to react. They didn’t seem to think that even if they felt something strange, it might be dangerous. Even Isario and Orfalve were standing there. They were distracted, or rather, they couldn’t hostile. Anyway, they were not even able to get a weapon from the powerful. At any rate, the powerful ones couldn’t even get a weapon.  I tried to put up barriers around themselves to help the people around us. The others will be here in time!  </p>
<p>『Kuh!』</p>
<p>  They brace themselves for the expected impact, but nothing will happen.  </p>
<p>『?』</p>
<p>「Don’t worry, I have no harmful intentions towards you」</p>
<p>  Then, a stiff voice echoed through the air.  Maybe I was a little similar to Announcer-san?  </p>
<p>『Eh?  Who?』</p>
<p>「I am one of the pillars of the ones in charge of the greenery. You are the ones who call myself the Goddess of Wind and Trees」</p>
<p>  Haaah?  Gods?  Is the fact that she is the Goddess of Wind and Trees the Goddess of Forests?  Why? It seems that the others are unable to move after feeling the presence of the Gods.  No, are some of them okay? Isario, Hilt, and Fran seem to have already gotten out of their stubbornness.  I guess that’s the same reason why I could move from the beginning. Because I was a soul born on Earth, I was resistant to the presence of the Gods. The ball of light floating a few meters above the ground continued to talk, regardless of our attitude.  </p>
<p>「The reason for my coming down is to punish the Gods」</p>
<p>  The ball of light―― the Gods of Wind and Trees seemed to have shined brightly, and a few grains of light were released into the surrounding area. However, it soon gathered in front of the Gods and gradually formed.  It was a human that appeared.  It was a girl that looked familiar.  </p>
<p>『Mertritte...』</p>
<p>Mertorite, who should have disappeared with the giant antidemons, was lying on the ground.  </p>
<p>「This place... Why...?」</p>
<p>「With her remaining soul at the center, I performed a physical reconstruction.  You need to atone for your crimes. I will punish you.」</p>
<p> Everyone was gasp at the quiet, yet indescribable words from the Gods.  No one was thinking about it. I guess that’s just how terrifying Divine Punishment is.  Seliadot looked a little different too.  She had a pale face and a half-hearted breathing.  It was probably because something terrified had happened. As she looked up at the Gods, she muttered in a trembling voice.  </p>
<p>「Naturally God...」</p>
<p>『What do you mean?』</p>
<p>(A sword?  A God in human form can expect emotions and pity from him. But the God in human form does not have that)</p>
<p>『In other words, when it comes to decisions that do not have an extenuating heart or anything like that, and are not bloodthirsty?』</p>
<p>「That’s right...  There’s no swelling in anger, but it’s also because it’s so pitiful that it doesn’t get mitigated.  Besides, Divine Punishment is a strong way to show off to others. When the Naturally Gods are in charge of it, the content and scale of the Divine Punishment often changes?」</p>
<p>『Or rather, do the Gods also change the content and scale of the Divine Punishment?』</p>
<p>(There are different punishments for different people in the human world, right?  Even if they are punished the same punishment, there will be differences between those who will execution it. Even if they are punished ten times, the Gods will do the same)</p>
<p>  If a slender man and a woman were to execution, there would be a difference in pain. Moreover, if there are different Judges, even the same offense can be punished differently. And in the case of the Naturally Gods, they often punished them more heartlessly on all sides.  </p>
<p>(I guess the Naturally Gods are not interested in people in the first place)</p>
<p>『That’s how it works』</p>
<p> But she knew all about that.  </p>
<p>(I’ve been researching why Divine Punishment doesn’t go down on her because she doesn’t allow her to do what that Poison Magic-User did. Well, I only found out that the Gods are not involved in a conflict between people.)</p>
<p> Seliadot didn’t dare mention it, but did she think about using the power of the Evil God Fragment?  The other party was an organization with terrifyingly strong poison users and a large number of illegal slaves.  It was too powerful to fight alone. And wouldn’t she have given up when she found out that she would be punished by the gods if she used the Evil God Fragment? </p>
<p>(Besides, I didn’t expect it to be this quick...)</p>
<p>『That’s probably because there’s a Divine Sword in this place』</p>
<p>(What do you mean―― No, the Divine Sword is a kind of divine sword that grants a part of a person’s power to their kin.  Are you looking at people’s world through the Divine Sword?)</p>
<p>『Looks like that』</p>
<p>(So that means... I’m either lucky or bad...)</p>
<p>  It also didn’t matter if they were just after the Beast Bug Gods came down. The conditions made it easier for the Gods to show up. Before Seliadot looked at her with a pale face, the orb of light flickered.  </p>
<p>「Merritite, a sinner. Your sin is your dishonesty contact with the Evil God Fragment and your private and one-sided use of it」</p>
<p>「――!」</p>
<p> Merutite was trying to argue, but he was silent.  No objection is needed, so I guess he already knows how to accept a fixed punishment.  It’s not just the natural Gods, many Gods don’t seem to be interested in people.  This time, the Divine Punishment didn’t touch on the point of slaughtering people at all. It’s probably because it’s not a crime for the Gods.  However, Seliadot looked a little surprised.However, Seliadot looked a little surprised.  </p>
<p>(She’ll bring a complaint......)</p>
<p>『The other Gods don’t give a reason when they’re punishing them?』</p>
<p>(They can only say that according to the Gods.  However, in most cases, the natural Gods only say that they will punish them, and there is no need to talk back to them.  There are countless stories about towns and people who were destroyed without knowing anything about them)</p>
<p>『Uwah.  That’s scary』</p>
<p>  That’s why the ball of light in front of me gave a firm reason even though she was a natural God. Is it a surprisingly gentle God?  </p>
<p>「However, it was not a direct connection to the pieces of the Evil God, but an indirectly contact through another person.  Also, the exchange of power using divine tools can be considered as a contract. Therefore, the guilt will be handled as a punishment for you individuals」</p>
<p>  She was clearly telling Seliadot about this, wasn’t she? As I thought, she was like a God who could sense her presence.  Seliadot was so relieved that it made me wonder if she might collapse. It’s no wonder though, since Seliadot’s future was protected.  </p>
<p>「You should keep hunting antidemons on this continent.  Until the day the pieces of the Evil God of Gordicia are freed from slavery.」</p>
<p> As soon as the God told her this, Meritte’s body lit up.  </p>
<p>「Now you are the same body as the sinner Trismegistus.Seliadot was so relieved that it looked like he might collapse. Since the future of the lorelei had been protected, it was no wonder. </p>
<p>「You shall keep hunting antidemons on this continent. Until the day the pieces of the Evil Gods of Gordicia are freed from slavery.」</p>
<p> As soon as the God told her this, Meritte’s body lit up. </p>
<p>「Now you are the same body as the sinner Trismegistus. We will continue to atone for you in this eternal and inexhaustible prison.」</p>
