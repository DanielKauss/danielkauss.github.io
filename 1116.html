</div><h1>Chapter 1116</h1><p>We had been pretty busy for a few days, cleaning up rubble, administering first aid to those injured, and witnessing the interrogation of the captives we handed over. The captives, or rather, the Chief of the Soldiers, had a good time with Klimut.</p>
<p>The interrogation went very smoothly with the soldier chief trying to convince the other captives.</p>
<p>We also sold some supplies we had on hand to the guild, including item bags and armor we had taken from our enemies.</p>
<p>The most expensive one was probably an item bag. Unfortunately, the item bag possessed by Hydeman and the others was broken because it had been pierced. In the first place, it must have been designed to return to a normal bag when it was forcibly opened so that it could not be reused by the enemy.</p>
<p>The item bags we had stored in the past came to about 2 million Goldes in all. I didn’t think we could have reached 3 million if Hydeman’s bag was still alive. It’s a pity though. I’ll have to be more cautious about opening it next time.</p>
<p>Fran may have really wanted to go to the battlefield right away, but we couldn’t leave Alessa unattended. There was a risk that Hydman would appear again after all.</p>
<p>But now that the surveillance network using Klimut’s spirit was starting to work, it would be difficult for Hydman to enter Alessa again.</p>
<p>Once all our worries were over, it was only natural that she would start wanting to leave. However, before Fran could decide to leave, Klimut called her.</p>
<p>「Responsible for the transport mission?」</p>
<p>「Yes. I’m in charge of transportation of supplies to the border and the movement of volunteer and duty-free soldiers who have gathered from all over the country」</p>
<p>They will also be guarding the supplies, and will be incorporated into the troops when they are on the battlefield. Fran herself will not be treated as a valiant soldier, but as the leader of the troops sent by the guild.</p>
<p>「......Are you sure?」</p>
<p>Fran tilted her head as she asked Klimut. I guess it was really strange that she was asked to do this.</p>
<p>I know that Klimt does not want to put children in the front line. Even when we were told that this request was made, we thought it was a request to leave the battlefield.</p>
<p>That was the request to go to war. Both Fran and I were surprised by Klimut’s words.</p>
<p>Klimt chuckled when he saw Fran’s reaction.</p>
<p>「It’s all of a sudden, you know? It’s all of a sudden...... If we leave it alone, we might just rush straight into the Raidos Kingdom. So, I’m willing to take on this request and have them stay in a place where we can see it」</p>
<p>「I see」</p>
<p>「......I’m going to Colbert.」</p>
<p>I also guess there’s a hint of guilt in this request.</p>
<p>It would take a lot of time to move a bunch of volunteer soldiers and supplies. In other words, Klimt was trying to delay Fran’s arrival at the battlefield.</p>
<p>Well, I could understand Klimt’s feelings, and I’m grateful for that.</p>
<p>Perhaps I myself don’t even know where it is, so the hurdles for not only killing people but also fighting and the battlefield are low.</p>
<p>I guess that must be a part of me that was played around by the Gods when I became a sword. Even though I was determined not to impose the common sense of Earth on Fran, I could tell that it was strange that Fran, a child, was not even averse to going to the battlefield.</p>
<p>Even after thinking that far, I still didn’t feel like separating Fran from the battlefield. That was why I was grateful to have adults like Klimt who saw Fran as a child.</p>
<p>『Fran, let’s take this request』</p>
<p>(Should I take it?)</p>
<p>『Yeah, I think so』</p>
<p>Fran wanted to go to the battlefield as soon as possible, so she was hesitating to take it or not.</p>
<p>「Okay. I’ll take the request」</p>
<p>「I see, I see. I’m glad to hear that. Well then, the valiant soldiers are expected to arrive in a few days, so please wait in Alessa until then」</p>
<p>「You haven’t arrived in Alessa yet?」</p>
<p>「Yes, you’re right, something?」</p>
<p>「...It’s nothing.」</p>
<p>Oops, I got this. I didn’t know the valiant soldier hadn’t arrived yet. Well, I knew.</p>
<p>『Fran. I know you’re in a hurry, but calm down. This request is pretty important, right?』</p>
<p>(Really?)</p>
<p>『Yeah. Like the Braves, we really need supplies. Fran, what should we do if we ever get hungry on the battlefield?』</p>
<p>(I’ll take out the food and eat it)</p>
<p>『What if we don’t have anything to eat in our storage or in the camp? You’ve been hungry all this time, right? Can we fight with that?』</p>
<p>(Don’t fight! Eating is important!)</p>
<p>『Right? That’s why this supplies are so important. In a sense, it’s even more than a force to be reckoned with.』</p>
<p>(Got it! I’m going to deliver my food to everyone)</p>
<p>Fran’s motivation switch had turned on. She must have understood the importance of supplies by replacing her with her own.</p>
<p>She stared back at Klimut with firm eyes.</p>
<p>「W-What is it? I won’t take it now or anything, okay? I-I won’t tell you, right?」</p>
<p>「I’ll definitely do this request」</p>
<p>「Y-yes. For some reason, I’m feeling motivated too. So, you’re willing to take it?」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Upon Klimt’s request, Fran used her waiting time to hunt around Alessa. She wanted to buy some food in case of emergency.</p>
<p>I had accepted a hunting request and processed it from one side. I picked up half of the meat myself and sold the other half to the guild.</p>
<p>「Fran-chan. Thank you! Thanks to you, I’ve secured a lot of meat!」</p>
<p>「You have enough food?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, I’m fine!」</p>
<p>Nell-san was overjoyed to see Fran, who had brought back a large amount of Magic Beast’s meat in just half a day. Even though the taste was not that great, she had hunted a large Magic Beast after all.</p>
<p>The adventurers worked together to dismantle the hard and smelly meat of the magic beasts like Elephant and Hilt’s hippocampus. If we dried it, we’d get a good amount of it.</p>
<p>Maybe they’ve been serving a lot of food since they arrived back in the Kingdom of Kranzel?</p>
<p>「Nell, are you asking me about the request?」</p>
<p>「Sure thing honey. What did you want to know?」</p>
<p>「Who knows the streets? Do you know the streets of Raydoss?」</p>
<p>「The borderline is now Raydoss, but it was originally a different country」</p>
<p>There is currently no country between Kranzel and Raidos. Oh, Filurias is there though. But that is all.</p>
<p>However, until about 50 years ago, there were several small countries, which seemed to have become a sort of cushion for both countries. Now that they were absorbed by one country, there were quite a few people from that country.</p>
<p>They said that the adventurers of the guild would show us around the ruined country.</p>
<p>「What kind of person is she?」</p>
<p>「You’re a bad guy, aren’t you? Well, you’re a high-ranked adventurer, so you have a lot to talk about」</p>
<p>A high-ranked adventurer, huh? Well then, they must be weirdos. All the guys except Fran were weirdos too.</p>
