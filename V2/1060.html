</div><h1>Chapter 1060</h1><p>Each time Fran swung me, several Raydoss soldiers lost their lives, and my spells turned the humans into firecrackers. Fran, on the other hand, only consumed some magic power and was not even as wounded as her fur. It may look like a one-sided battle, but in fact, the quality of the soldiers was not bad. The level of training in group battles was appropriate. Perhaps it would be better for her to against magic beasts that already had some information, and she would be able to utilize that to her advantage. This was a strategy where the surrounding spears and bows damage while repelling their attacks with the vanguard. This was a strategy that allowed the spears and bows around her to inflict damage on her while repelling their attacks with the vanguard.  Besides, they seemed to be mentally trained. Quite a few of them were willing to defeat Fran even if it meant risking their lives. But this time, however, the Raydoss soldiers had too many bad conditions.  They were fighting in a tight spot called a harbor, and they couldn’t form a good formation because they were arriving in different ports. Moreover, the chain of command seemed to be in chaos.  Apparently, the commander we caught was the highest commander in this place. The battle began before they could take over, so the chaos seemed to be continuing. And the main problem was that Fran was too strong. </p>
<p>「Save me!」</p>
<p>「GYAAAAAAAAAAAH!」</p>
<p>  No matter how hard Raydoss’s soldiers pushed themselves, they simply scratched their armor sleeves.  Soldiers were slashed aside and sliced flying away at a tremendous pace.  On the other hand, attacks from Raydoss’s side would be ineffective at all. His evasion ability was tremendous, and even if it hits, his barriers would easily repel it. The more soldiers he had, the more damage he had suffered. The soldiers, who had been intimidating at first, were clearly beginning to fall back.  Dead bodies were piled up all over the harbor, and fish were swarming and plopping around the bodies of their friends floating on the sea.  The girl who created the scene was a black cat girl who looked young.  She was shattered by a single girl without being able to do anything to help the troops. It must have been a nightmare. Finally, some people screamed and ran away without preparing any weapons.  It doesn’t matter if their superiors told them that it was a breach of orders. Then, as it started, the number of people who started to run away began to increase.  However, a large number of magical beasts appeared on the Raidos Kingdom’s side.  At the front were magic beasts like tigers.  They were Snike Reo, a cat-shaped magic beast with excellent exploration abilities. It was probably introduced for security purposes, just like the Lesser Rock.  There were a few of them, four of them. There were also wolf-shaped magic beasts and cow-shaped magic beasts for carrying around.  </p>
<p>「Grrrr!」</p>
<p>「Don’t look away! The target is that little girl!」</p>
<p>「Grrrrr...」</p>
<p>  The men behind them were probably magic beast users. They were chastising the magic beast that drooped when they saw the soldiers’ bodies.  Small bat-like magic beasts were also gathering in the sky.  When the magic beast appeared as a reinforcement, some of the soldiers seemed to have regained their composure. Fran seemed to have been completely encircled――  </p>
<p>(Magic beast... </p>
<p>『Yeah, it seems so』</p>
<p>  This swarm of magic beasts was cute compared to the antidemon army. To us, it felt like a magic stone came from the other side. It was kicked and kicked again in less than five minutes.  No, it looked even worse than before. The soldiers, who had been shown to be annihilated without being able to do anything, were in a state that could even be called crazy.  If we continued to pursue them, we would be able to defeat even more soldiers. However, we did not pursue them.  </p>
<p>『You’ve finally made your move!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p> The shots began to hit the Raydoss fleet, which was docked at Dars Port.  It didn’t matter if they felt Fran was a threat or if they still had friends with her. The brave Raydoss soldiers remaining around Fran were blown away by the bombardment.  Fran rushed into the shadow of the earth wall I had created, grabbing and dragging the neck of the magic beast user. I brought the magic beast user with me to get information about them. The magic beast user must have thought that she had been abandoned by being exposed to the bombardment despite being herself.  The magic beast user started to blurt out his feelings.  Many of the residents of Dars had escaped, but there were still nearly 300 captives. They mainly consisted of residents and sailors who had failed to escape, as well as soldiers and adventurers who had fought in the dono. Among them, healthy adults and children were transported north by boat, and injured people and old people were planned to be kept in Dars for a while.  However, it seemed that the Adventurers we rescued were the first group to be transported, and there were still no residents on board. In other words, the Raidos fleet that was anchored in Dars was only carrying soldiers from the Kingdom of Raidos. Incidentally, the reason why the Sea of Seedran was not a ship was because it was deployed to capture Barbra.  </p>
<p>(Master)</p>
<p>  Fran’s eyes were filled with motivation.  Well, if we destroy the Raidos fleet here, it would lead to the safety of not only Dars but also Barbra. They were completely ready for battle.  However, I was also worried about that.  </p>
<p>『... It might bring another force like Marl. If he’s being forcibly manipulated, will he be able to fight?』</p>
<p>(... I can.)</p>
<p>  Fran nodded with a look of determination. I’d love to avoid a battle that could hurt Fran’s mind again...  But there was no way Fran would back down so far.  </p>
<p>『Okay, let’s do it.』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  I bind the magic beast users and leave them in the shadows.  If the battle is over and they’re still alive, I can hand them over to the guild as a source of information.  If they get caught up in a gunshot or something―― Well, at that time. I was just bad luck.  As soon as I erased Great Wall, Fran jumped out.</p>
<p>「Understood!」</p>
