</div><h1>Chapter 1008</h1><p>「Black Lightning God’s Claw!」</p>
<p>The black lightning on Fran’s body then converged on my blade and covered the whole body.</p>
<p>『Your control over this technique is so perfect!』</p>
<p>It was a flowing manipulation of black lightning. I guess this was also thanks to the blessings of the Beast Bug God. After all, the control of the techniques related to the Divine Attribute was surprisingly smooth.</p>
<p>Moreover, I was using the Black Lightning God’s Claw while still maintaining my Sword God Transformation. It was a fusion of my trump card and my trump card.</p>
<p>As expected, she’s been wearing a lot of things after coming this far. My durability value had started to decrease drastically. It was not a technique that I could use all the time.</p>
<p>「She’s prepared!」</p>
<p>「Kuh......!」</p>
<p>Fran swung me at him. The lack of calmness in his movements made it easy for him to get caught in his attacks.</p>
<p>He quickly raised his cross-shaped magic sword above his head and tried to take Fran’s attack. However, he quickly withdrew his sword.</p>
<p>She hated to take it with her sword. After seeing me clad in black lightning, she must have felt that the cross-shaped magic sword was dangerous.</p>
<p>And so, when he was free, Fran’s front kick was thrust into his abdomen.</p>
<p>「Ghaa!」</p>
<p>With a crack in her hard chest, Fran jumped backwards. She followed her and readied me above her head.</p>
<p>Meritte was unable to control her movements in a cone, and Fran was able to perform any kind of movement by leaping in the air.</p>
<p>The next blow was sure to hit her.</p>
<p>『I can go with the brute force method now, but I don’t know if I’ll be able to defeat the antidemonized Meritte. But more――』</p>
<p>(Sword!)</p>
<p>I was confident that it was as if Meritte found it dangerous. After all, I understood the hardness of the other side from our previous fights.</p>
<p>With the power of the Sword God Transformation and the Black Lightning God’s Claw, I’m sure I can cut through the cross-shaped magic sword.</p>
<p>(If we destroyed it, we might be able to interfere with Meritte’s plan)</p>
<p>『That’s right』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Fran exhaled lightly as she aimed at them. That showed that she was ready.</p>
<p>「You’ve gone so far!」</p>
<p>After realizing that Fran’s aim was not her own, but the cross-shaped magic sword in her hand, Meritte shouted hopelessly.</p>
<p>His face looked like that of a normal human being. He was neither a warrior nor a powerful person, just an antidemon.</p>
<p>She was just a woman who only grieved and lamented for the world. I’m sure if she didn’t have the will to seek revenge, her life would have ended peacefully.</p>
<p>Fran looked sad for a moment. But soon after, she returned to her determined face and swung down the blade of black lightning.</p>
<p>「Raaaaaah! Heavenly Judgment!」</p>
<p>Fran turned into the Sword God Transformation, the Black Lightning God’s Claw, and finally to the Heaven Judgement. This was the strongest shot that the current Fran could use.</p>
<p>「Stop!」</p>
<p>However, it didn’t work when he was still blown away in mid-air.</p>
<p>In the first place, the cross-shaped magic sword was so huge that even the small Meritte’s body could not hide it.</p>
<p>Black Blade, Crusher Magic Sword――</p>
<p>Gaaang!</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>With an explosion so loud that it was hard to believe swords clashing with each other, black lightning and golden magic power scattered violently.</p>
<p>「Guh!」</p>
<p>「...!」</p>
<p>It was not the cross-shaped magic sword that I clashed with. For a moment when I was convinced that my blade, which was swung at a godspeed, would cut through the cross-shaped magic sword, Falcion of white silver intervened.</p>
<p>It was a golden dragonkin who interrupted us. The man who had caught the attack in an impossible position was flicked away with tremendous force.</p>
<p>Seeing the man who had intervened between them, Fran and Merritte said his name at the same time.</p>
<p>「Trismegistus...!」</p>
<p>「Trismegistus!」</p>
<p>Both of them had bitter looks on their faces.</p>
<p>Aside from Fran, who was bothered by it, why was she staring at Trismegistus until Meritte, who had been saved?</p>
<p>He was apparently burned by the black lightning coming from Falcion, and was also deeply slashed from the shoulder by the attack that could not be fully canceled out. He stood up, holding the wound with his scorched hand. However, the golden dragonkin seemed to be more interested in his beloved sword than he was in himself. He stroked his blade with a red bloody hand and nodded many times.</p>
<p>「It might have been dangerous if I hadn’t been clothed in magic power. I see」</p>
<p>After being caught by a killing blow, Fran backstepped away from Trismegistus and canceled his Sword God Transformation.</p>
<p>My instincts must have understood that it would be more dangerous than this. In fact, the decrease in my durability value was beginning to accelerate. It seemed that I was now able to discern dangerous areas.</p>
<p>(It got stopped......)</p>
<p>『Yeah. It looks like Trismegistus has sent a huge amount of magic power into his sword. I wouldn’t be surprised if that sword is now as strong as a divine sword』</p>
<p>(Nn......)</p>
<p>Fran exhaled wildly and looked frustrated. She had put all of her strength into her attack, but it was blocked by that level of damage. I guess it couldn’t be helped.</p>
<p>Just by inflicting a lot of wounds on a monster in its Divine Dragon Form state and succeeding in defeating it even more, I think it would be tremendous.</p>
<p>While Fran was breathing, Meritte was hit by Trismegistus too. His eyes were completely focused on the enemy.</p>
<p>「......Why did you save me! Trismegistus!」</p>
<p>「That’s because my beloved sword, Juanaverta, said it was better that way」</p>
