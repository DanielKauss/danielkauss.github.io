</div><h1>Chapter 943</h1><p>After releasing the power of his Blade of Origin, Alpha, he plunged into the antidemon army by himself.</p>
<p>100,000 vs. one person. But we didn’t have any worries as we were watching it.</p>
<p>The holy knights didn’t even go to support them, really fighting alone.</p>
<p>Maybe the holy knights were being expelled along the way. Also, maybe they were trying to wipe out any attempted attackers?</p>
<p>Besides, they’d be completely involved if we were near that Addler. It would be difficult to cover for them.</p>
<p>Each time that the white magic-powered Addle wielded its Divine Sword, a tsunami-like shockwave was released, swallowing the antidemons.</p>
<p>Not to mention the power, it was just a wide range. Fran could fire a flying slash, but it was impossible to spread it that far.</p>
<p>There was no expression on Addle’s face as she slayed the antidemons. I also felt uncomfortable with her refreshing face, which seemed to be the work of before the Divine Sword Release, but I felt something strange when she suddenly lost her expression.</p>
<p>He didn’t seem to have any intention of missing any of the antidemons, and was politely crushing them from the lower class antidemons without being able to target the commander at once.</p>
<p>There was no disturbance.</p>
<p>The wielder of the divine sword wielded solid power to make his enemies disappear from the inside out. Such a scene continued until the very end.</p>
<p>「It’s over」</p>
<p>『Yeah... It really was the same until the very end.』</p>
<p>The commander, who had been cut in half and defeated just a few seconds ago, was not weak. The current Fran, who had no Divine Beast Form, must have had a hard time.</p>
<p>I’m not saying that we will lose, but it will take a good amount of time even if we try our best.</p>
<p>They were instantly wiped out, just like lower class antidemons.</p>
<p>As I’d thought, the power of the Divine Sword was ridiculous. And it seemed that Addle was raised to demonstrate its full power.</p>
<p>With that in mind, it would not be an exaggeration to say that she was the strongest person in the world when she used the Divine Sword Release.</p>
<p>(I want to see a fight with someone stronger.)</p>
<p>『Yeah, I’m interested in what would happen if she were a Unique of the class that was in Sendia』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p>Ader put his Divine Sword in his sheath. The white magic power that had been scattered around him disappeared, and silence came to the plains.</p>
<p>The holy knights, aside from Adel, didn’t cheer. They probably thought it was a shame if they caused a commotion. Also, if they knew the power of Adel and Alpha, they probably thought it was only natural for an opponent of this level.</p>
<p>『I can see the horror of Alpha.』</p>
<p>(Adr is also strong.)</p>
<p>『Yeah』</p>
<p>As one would expect from a large country. Instead of letting strong people use the divine sword, they were training those who would become the strongest when they used the divine sword...</p>
<p>I’m very curious to hear more about Berserk now. I wonder how strong he is as if he was two against Alpha.</p>
<p>As I was thinking about this on top of the wall, I noticed someone approaching us. They didn’t seem to be an adventurer working for the city walls.</p>
<p>She was a beautiful girl with reddish-purple hair tied into twin tails, who looked a little older than Fran. Moreover, she didn’t look like an adventurer.</p>
<p>She was wearing a gothic dress based on black. Not a dress armor, but a miniskirt dress. She might be using a monster material, but she didn’t look like a defensive one.</p>
<p>For such a conspicuous person, she would remember it at the time of the meeting.</p>
<p>Her face was still expressionless, but no sense of hostility. Who was she? It was obvious that Fran had some business to attend to.</p>
<p>「......Who are you?」</p>
<p>「I’m the Hydrangea. I’m from the Kingdom of Hagane」</p>
<p>Commander Hagane? Could it be that she was in a carriage protected by the old soldiers? If so, this girl named Hydrangea was――.</p>
<p>「......Her wielder of the divine sword?」</p>
<p>That’s right. It wouldn’t be possible for many people to ride that carriage, and if there were other people besides the commander, it was most likely the wielder of the Divine Sword.</p>
<p>If used, it would definitely go out of control and eventually kill Berserk, the worst Divine Sword in the world.</p>
<p>The wielder is, to put it bluntly, a sacrifice. Is this girl their sacrifice?</p>
<p>The hydrangea shrugged in response to Fran’s question. The fact that it was expressionless and hard to read emotions was very similar to Fran’s.</p>
<p>「How about I take you on? I can say that’s not the case.」</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>「Are you an adventurer?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Fran, a B-ranked adventurer」</p>
<p>「Yeah. You――」</p>
<p>「Hydrangea. So, you were here now. It’s about time to move」</p>
<p>「Mulsani-san.」</p>
<p>The one who called out to the hydrangea was a girl with a face very similar to her. I guess she was a little older than her.</p>
<p>It had long, snow-white hair that was broadly divided into left and right. It looked as if it was divided into three blocks: right bangs, left bangs, and hind hair.</p>
<p>She was wearing a black dress in a long skirt, a little quieter than the hydrangea. Well, in the end, she was wearing a gothic dress with frills though.</p>
<p>This girl wore a smile unlike the hydrangea. But why was the hydrangea more approachable than the hydrangea? Maybe it was because the smile on this guy’s face was clearly created by that guy.</p>
<p>「A hydrangea lady?」</p>
<p>「Yes and no. I suppose I could say that’s not the case.」</p>
<p>「That again」</p>
<p>「It’s true, so it can’t be helped」</p>
<p>The hydrangea shrugged lightly and turned around. I wondered what she was after. Maybe she wanted to talk to Fran, who looked similar to her.</p>
<p>「See ya」</p>
<p>「Yeah」</p>
<p>The hydrangea nodded at Fran’s words. Their expressions were very similar.</p>
<p>『In the end, I didn’t even know if they were wielders of the divine sword or not』</p>
<p>His fighting ability was probably about Diggins. But it’s something that happened after I saw him. It didn’t matter if he had his own fighting ability or not, he was the wielder of the divine sword or not.</p>
<p>I just thought it would be best if she could be different. To think such a girl was a Divine Sword sacrifice...... But Fran muttered to herself.</p>
<p>「I’m sure he’s the wielder of the divine sword」</p>
<p>『Why did you think so?』</p>
<p>「Kinda...」</p>
<p>There seemed to be a slight hint of sadness in Fran’s eyes as she saw off the hydrangea’s back.</p>
