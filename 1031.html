</div><h1>Chapter 1031</h1><p>Trismegistus said that his goal was to kill large numbers of people. </p>
<p>『You......!』</p>
<p> Even though he knew it was in vain, he could not control his anger. However, it was not Trismegistus who reacted to my mutter. </p>
<p>『I’ll tell you which one is worse, because you’re so angry for misjudging things you don’t know anything!』</p>
<p>Juanaverta shouted in a high-pitched voice. </p>
<p>『When Trismegistus-sama was pushed into that castle, there were only dragonkin and my Lord on this continent. There were no major people on this continent for a while. They were on a continent that had been punished by the gods, and I told only those who could fight are allowed to enter in the first place.』</p>
<p> That was because the continent was punished by the gods, and in the first place, they only told those who could fight are allowed to enter.』</p>
<p>『Only those who can fight? But......』</p>
<p>  Many of the residents of Nocta seemed to be ordinary citizens. Not all of them could fight.  </p>
<p>『Yeah!  Yes, that’s right!  There are many powerless maggots on this continent today that can only feed on antidemons! Can you tell how much of a burden that is placed on Trismegistus-sama?』</p>
<p>  If there were more and more people who could eat without defeating antidemons, the Abyss Eater would become more and more powerful.If there were more people who could eat without defeating antidemons, the Abyss Eater would become more powerful.  I don’t know how much Trismegistus eats away at the Abyss every day, but it seemed to be less efficient.  Trismegistus and the dragonkin were fine when there were only a few adventurers left, but now they looked completely different.Trismegistus and the dragonkin were fine when there were only a few adventurers left, but now they looked completely different.  Trismegistus had also ordered them to leave the continent many times if they were to interfere with their mission.  However, most of the people living on this continent had no place to stay outside.  The people of Gordicia were those who fled from other continents or their descendants. The problems faced by those fleeing to this continent were not something that could be easily handle.  Take the criminals, for example.  As is common sense in this world, criminals are often captured and enslaved. Just putting them in jail would only be a waste of their money and they also take up a lot of space.  Therefore, it would be clearly more profitable to enslave them for minor crimes. Light crime slaves are clearly guaranteed their rights, and they are treated differently than slaves on Earth in the past.  It was like prison work, and there was little chance that they would be used up or mistreated. It was even better treated as a debt slave, like a job placement.  As Fran’s partner, I have no good feelings about slaves. However, I understand that it was a necessary system for the return of minor criminals to society and effective use of them.  On the other hand, slaves for serious crimes were also treated badly. There were meat walls on the battlefield, an experimental table for dangerous new drugs, and many other things that were not considered human rights. It would be a shame to just let them die, and I don’t blame them for the fact that they are making effective use of them in the end.  And on the same level as the slaves for serious crimes, there was the punishment of “Sending Gordicia”. In other words, coming to this continent was like the death penalty for the average person.  In such a situation, what kind of people would come to this continent on their own?  Many of them were serious criminals who came to this continent as destinations for escape, rather than being sent with shackles. Naturally, they were wanted by other continents and guilds, so it was impossible for them to leave this continent.  There were also many political criminals, such as royalty and nobles of the destroyed countries.  After all, they were definitely something that the invaders could not leave unattended. If they were to be captured, they would be thrown in jail for the rest of their life or be thrown to death.  In that case, many of them fled to Gordisia.  Also, some countries sent influential people from the captured enemy countries to Gordisia without using the death penalty in consideration for the people in the controlled areas.  They wanted to say that it was better than the death penalty. Some of them could not leave the continent because of it.  Moreover, their descendants have built up and increased the number of towns.  This also made it impossible for many of them to fight. People born on this continent had no family registers or foreign exchange.  It was impossible for such people to suddenly leave.  Many countries were asked to accept the request from their own countries, so they didn’t actively support the retreat.  However, Trismegistus could not easily allow him to do so. For him now, only the achievement of the mission given by the Gods was important.  As a result, it led to this slaughter. For Trismegistus, it must have been a two-way-one-stone strategy that allowed him to create huge antidemons and thin out annoying people.  </p>
<p>『Ahahahahaha!  Everything was just what Trismegistus-sama and I wanted! Maggots were worth a little to my Lord!』</p>
<p>「According to my calculations, if we could work together with the existing forces, we would be able to defeat the strengthening antidemons without any problem. I didn’t expect them to be destroyed before I joined the fray.」</p>
<p>  Hearing those words, I suddenly wondered.  </p>
<p>『...... Why are they outside the castle?』</p>
<p>「If an antidemon born in the basement of the castle falls outside the barrier, the shackles are temporarily lifted to chase it, even within the second barrier.」</p>
<p>『So the second barrier is that purple dome?』</p>
<p>「Yes.  It’s a mechanism that the gods prepared for you to not let the antidemons escape.」</p>
<p>  It seems that it was not something Merritte had prepared, but something that already existed. So she used that to try and lock up the dragonkin. </p>
<p>「Fran and Master.  I will give you a reward.」</p>
<p>「Reward?」</p>
<p> Wait for Fran to get to me? As soon as Fran put her hand on my hilt, Trismegistus said those words.  But why are we the only ones who do that?  </p>
<p>『Yeah, Lord! We don’t need any reward for those!』</p>
<p>「The Divine Sword Magicians are obliged to fight the pieces of the Evil God.  It is not a reward for them.  Among the others, Fran and Master’s accomplishments were unrivaled. I’d say that they were only there to make us receive a reward」</p>
<p>  Although she didn’t like him at all, I could tell that this man was no one to dare or lie. He was probably just objectively looking at him and telling the truth.  Indeed, despite his fact that he was among the Divine Sword Magic-Users, he was able to perform an act that was not fair to me... I didn’t think that a reward was a normal thing.  </p>
<p>『Rewards?  What do you mean by giving me power?』</p>

Indeed, despite his fact that he was among the divine sword users, he was able to perform his duties on a par...... I didn’t think that a reward was a normal thing. </p>
<p>『Rewards? What do you mean by giving me power?』</p>
<p> Trismegistus said, and for some reason, he set up Juanaverta.</p>
