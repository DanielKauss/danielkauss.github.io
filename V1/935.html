</div><h1>Chapter 935</h1><p>「Miss Hilt. Can Uncle get a plate too?」</p>
<p>「......Nn.」</p>
<p>The Divine Sword man, of course, received a normal plate of grilled meat without showing any hostility towards us. He had no reason to antagonize us either.</p>
<p>He looked plain and fleshy, just like anywhere else in the world. I guess he was in his forties.</p>
<p>She had gray hair that looked like she had just cut it properly and a slightly dark stubble beard, which gave the impression of a manly appearance. She was a little cat-like, and had a strangely distorted appearance.</p>
<p>Or rather, it sounded like a salaryman after finishing work all night. Or maybe it was a middle-level management who was forced to give an impossible task?</p>
<p>She was almost adored by men, but seemed to be avoided by women.</p>
<p>He behaved in a puzzled manner as Fran stared at him. And soon he figured out the reason. He smirked and opened his mouth.</p>
<p>「Did you see through my sword?」</p>
<p>「Sh-she’s―」</p>
<p>「Oh man, don’t tell me what’s up ahead. I won’t be able to eat meat peacefully」</p>
<p>So, this was really a Divine Sword, huh? Fran’s gaze turned to the man’s waist. He looked a little flashy, but he had a long sword with a red gem embedded in the hilt. However, despite his appearance, he was strangely inconspicuous.</p>
<p>In the first place, it was strange that the people around her didn’t pay any attention to the man. Fran finally noticed this.</p>
<p>She looked around at the man with a puzzled look, then tilted her head at the man. Then the man picked up his cloak lightly and told us in a whisper.</p>
<p>「A cloak for blocking perception. A powerful guy made by an acquaintance. You’ll know he’s quite powerful just by recognizing me, right?」</p>
<p>His cloak seemed to be a magic tool. He didn’t seem to be able to deceive anyone with a certain level of ability, but his line seemed to be quite high. After all, no adventurer noticed this man except Fran.</p>
<p>Fran interrupted the sound with a silence and asked the question again. The man answered with a wry smile, as if he could tell the effect of magic at first sight.</p>
<p>「Is that a Divine Sword?」</p>
<p>「Just as the young lady saw through it, it’s the Flame Sword Ignis」</p>
<p>「Ooh. So you’re Isario?」</p>
<p>「That’s right. Uncle has become quite famous among the kids outside.」</p>
<p>So this was really Isario! I hadn’t expected to see him in Nocta.</p>
<p>When they found out that their opponent was an S-ranked adventurer, it’s strange to see a dumb and salaryman-like atmosphere here, like a relaxed atmosphere because of their strength or a sort of lunchtime atmosphere.</p>
<p>「Once again, I’m Isario, an adventurer with a divine sword. Call me whatever you want, regardless of how incompetent or incompetent you are」</p>
<p>「Silence?」</p>
<p>「That’s my alias.」</p>
<p>What do you mean when you say an S-Ranked adventurer is completely insane...?</p>
<p>Isario shook his shoulders and reached out his hand to Fran, who was tilting her head.</p>
<p>With her palms up, it was obvious that she was begging for meat.</p>
<p>「Just give me the meat, big bowl」</p>
<p>「......If you give me a mock battle, I’ll make it big.」</p>
<p>Fran, you’ve been pretty busy here! She thought this was a chance for her, but she simply refused.</p>
<p>「Just meat now! And booze!」</p>
<p>「You can have meat and wine at any time you want」</p>
<p>「Miss Hilt. The guild will pay you for the meat this time. That means you’re talking about free meat. I’ll understand what’s left of it, okay?」</p>
<p>Isario gave off a mischievous line with a clearly masculine expression on his face. I thought he was a little cool, but his current appearance was like that of a drunk adventurer himself.</p>
<p>「I don’t know」</p>
<p>「It was too early for you, huh? But it’s not as good as free liquor, isn’t it? I’m not going to let you get away, okay? Besides, we can’t do it here, okay?」</p>
<p>Certainly, we would have to use this training area to have a mock battle. This would interfere with a large party.</p>
<p>「...So, what’s tomorrow?」</p>
<p>「Tomorrow, I’ll get a request, so you can’t use it」</p>
<p>「Just a little bit in the morning?」</p>
<p>「You’ll get tired if you do a mock battle before a request, right? I have to challenge you with all my might, so I can’t do it」</p>
<p>「I think it’s time for her to get some real combat soon」</p>
<p>Isario must have been so right that she could no longer say anything. Fran then fell silent with a disappointed look on her face.</p>
<p>『Fran, give me the letter of introduction that Diaz gave me』</p>
<p>「I have a letter of introduction too」</p>
<p>「Hou? So it’s from Diaz-san huh...? Okay, but it’s still impossible for me right now. Well, sooner or later」</p>
<p>「Promised.」</p>
<p>「Okay, it’s the end of the antidemon season. Besides, what’s a big deal for me? A stronger opponent would tell me about it」</p>
<p>「S ranked adventurer, right?」</p>
<p>「It’s just a Dandy holding a Divine Sword」</p>
<p>I don’t know if he’s Dandy or not, but he just had a Divine Sword? Is there anything special about him?</p>
<p>The Flame Sword was a Divine Sword that was the same system as Ashwrath’s Gaia. And if it was a Divine Sword of Flame with high offensive power, it was probably quite powerful.</p>
<p>As long as she could master the Divine Sword, she might be able to become an S-ranked adventurer, even if she was a little weaker.</p>
<p>But I couldn’t see this man as an adventurer with only the power of a divine sword.</p>
<p>However, she didn’t seem to be humbled either. Isario seemed to really think that she had nothing to lose.</p>
<p>「Damn?」</p>
<p>「......No, it’s nothing. See ya again, young miss.」</p>
<p>Isario smiled bitterly at the end and disappeared among the adventurers.</p>
<p>(I failed to deliver a promise to participate in the mock battle)</p>
<p>『Well, she’s a Rank S adventurer after all. It’s no wonder she’s so busy』</p>
<p>(Nn......)</p>
<p>However, he was more like a person with common sense than the Beast King and Dimitris, and I think he would keep his words.</p>
<p>Well, they certainly looked a bit quirky compared to the Beast Kings.</p>
