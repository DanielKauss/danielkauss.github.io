</div><h1>Chapter 1002</h1><p>『The one who thought it was the mastermind died so easily......』</p>
<p>(Master. Everyone)</p>
<p> When Georg was defeated, Frederick and Frederick changed as well. They stopped moving and began to suffer. They were moaning with their heads in their arms. Then, the look on their faces showed the color of reason. Velmeria and Frederick were conscious, but Tilanaria collapsed. </p>
<p>「F-Run......」</p>
<p>「Velmeria!」</p>
<p>「Velmeria!」</p>
<p>  It seems that Georg was the one who caused them to go crazy. But why was Georg in such a state too?  </p>
<p>「Heal!」</p>
<p>「No! Got it!」</p>
<p>「Velmeria?」</p>
<p>「I don’t know what will happen yet.  Just leave it like this.」</p>
<p>  Velmeria still thought it was possible for them to control it. That’s why she thought it was better if she could not move properly.  Apparently, she still had some memories of herself in the middle of a rampage. Frederick who had collapsed also looked apologetic. </p>
<p>「I’m sorry, Black Lightning Princess.」</p>
<p>「No problem. More importantly, are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Aah......」</p>
<p> It seems that the backlash and exhaustion from giving her best was worse than the damage from doing her best. She wouldn’t die even if she didn’t recover.  Should I evacuate Velmeria and Frederick before doing anything about the robe bastard? Fran thought the same thing.  </p>
<p>「Isario...  evacuate Velmeria and Frederick――」</p>
<p>「You think we’ll make them?」</p>
<p>  Fran’s voice was interrupted by a sweet girl’s voice. It was a clear voice, just like the way she rolled up a bell.  What surprised me was the person who said it.  </p>
<p>「Oi oi!  You guys woke up at last, haven’t you? Robe, you bastard?」</p>
<p>「I’m not a bastard, you know?」</p>
<p>「A girl?」</p>
<p> A beautiful girl appeared from under the robe with beautiful blond hair and white skin. She was short in stature and didn’t seem to be over twenty years old.  Her ears were sharp, and maybe she was an Elf?  Her appraisal was still repelled as usual, but... It seems that she must have a very high level of concealment ability. As I was struggling to find a way to appraise her, the girl suddenly began to laugh.  </p>
<p>「Ahahahaha!  It really is nasty, isn’t it!?  I’ve been preparing for a long time and have made quick action!  How can I be so easily disturbed!  Aah― Despite her words, she didn’t smile. She was staring at her with disgust.  </p>
<p>「What the real Dragon King is he!?  I even gave him the Divine Dragon Form skill, but he didn’t lose so easily!  He’s really useless!  Even so, I was expecting so much from him! In the end, I was nothing but a worthless scumbag!」</p>
<p>  The girl shouted and stomped her cloak, not a smile. What I could feel from her dark and deep eyes was hatred and madness.  It was strange because just by looking at her like that, a little girl’s power would double. Isario, looking cautious, slowly spoke to the girl.  </p>
<p>「You, who the hell are you?」</p>
<p>「Why don’t you hit them?」</p>
<p>「Elf?」</p>
<p>  The girl replied with a smile on her nose.  It was a strong attitude. However, Isario didn’t get angry and opened his mouth with a grin.  He seemed to have decided to go out with the girl.  He was probably trying to get information from her. Fran also stopped moving for a moment to avoid seeming hostile.  </p>
<p>「It seems that the dragonkin have a grudge against you」</p>
<p>「Ara? You know that, don’t you?」</p>
<p>「You mean to say that she’s not an Elf?」</p>
<p>「And by the way, I think she’s older than you, right?」</p>
<p>  No matter how I look at her, she looked like she was only the same age as Fran, but it wouldn’t be surprising if she was a long-lived species.  They were a long-lived race other than Elves, and they were very similar to Elves? What kind of race is she?  </p>
<p>「Huh?  And what is that Onee-sama doing here for? It seems that she is in cahoots with the Dragon King, whom she should have a grudge against?」</p>
<p>「So they’re coming together? </p>
<p>「Well, it looks like they have a strong hierarchical relationship, doesn’t it?」</p>
<p>「Fufu.  You’re quite good at praising lizards, right?」</p>
<p>  Velmeria reacted to the dark smile of the robe girl. </p>
<p>「What are you――」</p>
<p>「I don’t allow lizards to speak on their own.  Shut up.  The air is dirty」</p>
<p>  There was no smile on the girl’s face after saying that.  Just looking at her face showed that she really didn’t like the dragonkin. No one had a good opinion of Velmeria and Frederick.  </p>
<p>「Oh, I’m afraid of it.  What the hell is that? </p>
<p>「Hmph.  It’s not interesting. It’s just the revenge of your kin.」</p>
<p>「Haha, I see.」</p>
<p>  So, you’re saying that your goal is revenge?  It’s certainly not interesting or troublesome. If they have a grudge against a source of action, it’s difficult to make them give up.  </p>
<p>「Can I have them give up? </p>
<p>「You’re confident, aren’t you?  Uncle, you’re a Rank S adventurer, aren’t you? You’re pretty strong, aren’t you?」</p>
<p>「You’re right. Maybe I can’t win against them?」</p>
<p> The girl clenched the hilt of her strange sword while pointing her other palm at us. Immediately after, a dense evil swollen from the girl’s body and attacked us.  </p>
<p>『Don’t get close!』</p>
<p>  The evil spirit that was stretching out like a tentacle dissipated with my skill. It seemed that Evil Domination was working. But when the girl saw it, a look of astonishment came over her face for the first time.  </p>
<p>「That’s crazy!</p>
<p>「That’s crazy!</p>
<p>「That’s crazy! There are other powers that can control Evil Spirits...!?」</p>
