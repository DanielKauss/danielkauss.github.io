</div><h1>Chapter 928</h1><p>『What was that, like the King Wolf’s Sword, Fenrir?』</p>
<p>『That... Even though it was going to be strengthened, I never thought that it was at the level where half-hearted naming would take place. We’re also surprised』</p>
<p>《Yes. Due to the freeze on the name change, some of the power that had lost its destination was on the verge of being out of control》</p>
<p>『That’s right. The naming process was about to take place, but I didn’t get a name in the end?』</p>
<p> The King Wolf’s Sword, Fenrir. It was a name that looked like a Divine Sword. It was a name that looked like a Divine Sword. My body was a failed Divine Sword, and with Fenrir-san’s power, I might be able to wield power on the level of a Divine Sword. However, based on the story that my mind before the battle cannot withstand it, it seems that it is not just a temporary change in name.  </p>
<p>『That is...  the possibility of the future.  Perhaps, Master is――one of the futures we might reach』</p>
<p>maybe we’ll reach』</p>
<p>『Does that mean I can become a Divine Sword?』</p>
<p>『That’s right.  The Divine Sword with my power, the King Wolf Sword, Fenrir』</p>
<p>『But, you don’t seem to like it somehow?』</p>
<p>『As I said before, Master can’t stand to be fused with my soul now. By being able to withstand it, it means that Master is no longer Master』</p>
<p>『M-could it be, that I have to become a Sword? Just like the Me over there that Rhyn showed me?』</p>
<p>『That’s right. That’s why it would be the worst thing for the current Master to get the name of the King Wolf Sword』</p>
<p>『I see...』</p>
<p>  If I don’t become a sword, I won’t be able to reach the Divine Sword, and when I become a Divine Sword, I won’t be able to become one.  I’m sure I can become stronger, but that’s...  Fran will be sad.  There’s no way. </p>
<p>『Then, what is an Evil Wolf Sword or an Intelligence Sword?』</p>
<p>《It has a different possibility than a King Wolf Sword.  An Evil Wolf Sword that drew out the power of the individual named Fenrir, who had been corrupted by the Evil Spirit.  A false Divine Sword, or Intelligence Sword, which integrated the residue of the Divine Sword that had already been destroyed. These are the results of being presented as possibilities》</p>
<p>『That too, means that it’s a possibility』</p>
<p>  At first glance, it seemed to be a good thing, but from Fenrir’s tone, it was probably not. Fenrir in a bitter tone then continued his explanation.  </p>
<p>『Master’s vessel is originally a Divine Sword, it manipulates the Divine Attribute, and its ability can already be said to be a Near Divine Sword.  Once Master is strengthened, the naming requirements will be met.  As for his existence, it is not a Divine Sword that can reach the Divine Sword. In other words, he would be treated as a Discarded Divine Sword』</p>
<p>《However, if the individual named Master’s name is changed, even if it is only for a moment, the initiative will be changed to the individual named Fenrir or the individual named Announcer-san》</p>
<p>『Then we will not be able to hold back the pieces of the Evil God. That’s why I’ve been allowed to stop the name change』</p>
<p>  The naming system is not very good, but when it’s approved by the Gods, the name will naturally be given.  It looks like Fran’s equipment. Normally, the name would change on its own, but in my case, thanks to the presence of Announcer-san and Fenrir, I was able to intervene in the naming process. And they judged that it would be dangerous if the naming process was successful and refused. </p>
<p>『So, in the end, it’s not good to just change your name so easily huh?』</p>
<p>『That’s what I’ve said.  Master, get stronger as you are, Master』</p>
<p>《Yes.  That’s also the wish of the individual named Fran》</p>
<p> I’m not going to fall in love with him, but I’m sure Announcer-san was right.  If I were to become a mechanical existence instead of gaining power as a Divine Sword, Fran would answer that she didn’t need a Divine Sword. </p>
<p>『Oops, it’s time huh?』</p>
<p>《Let’s go into a dormant state for a while》</p>
<p>『Well then, let’s say goodbye for a moment』</p>
<p>《During my dormant, please take care of the individual named Fran》</p>
<p>『Just say hi to Fran!』</p>
<p>  And I could feel that the presences of both of us inside me were suddenly decreasing. The strengthening effect was completely gone, and they must have gone into dormant.  They were goodbye to their reliable companions for a few days or weeks.  They only came back when they first came to this world, but they were strangely heartless. I guess that’s just how much I was relying on them.  If this was a big mistake, the two of them would get angry. I have to be ready.  Urushi must have noticed that my presence had changed and he looked at me with sleepy eyes.  </p>
<p>(Woof?)</p>
<p>『It seems that I don’t have to sleep. Leave Fran to me to escort you.』</p>
<p>(Woof!)</p>
<p>『You really did a great job this time too.  It’s because you went with Sophie that I’m able to get her support. It’s less conspicuous, but it was fine play you know?』</p>
<p>(Woof!)</p>
<p>『I know.  It’s a treat if it happens. So rest for now.』</p>
<p>(Woof woof!)</p>
<p> Urushi waved his tail happily and sniffed Fran’s lightly as she sank into the shadows. Zefmate next to her grunted when he saw Urushi like that.  </p>
<p>「Muh. I still can’t go to sleep...」</p>
<p>  Zefmate resisted his drowsiness and stood on his knees in front of Mea.  He must be trying to do his best as an escort until he was a little more at peace.  This was the difference between Urushi, who knew about my presence, and Zefmate, who didn’t know about me. I wanted to tell him that he could sleep because I’m watching, but he couldn’t right now.  But then the Goddess of salvation appeared.  Well, she’s not kind enough to be a Goddess though. No, the Goddess of this world is rather harsh, so I wonder if she’s the right Goddess?  </p>
<p>「Zefmate.  Please explain」</p>
<p>「Quina,-sama」</p>
<p>「You seem to have become exhausted quite a bit. Even the young lady is still wary of that, but she never thought she’d sleep in a place like this...」</p>
<p>  It was Mea’s maiden, Quina.  She looked as expressionless as ever.  </p>
<p>「Fight against a swarm of antidemons. And with the help of the saintess...」</p>
<p>  Zefmate tried to explain to her, but because of her drowsiness, he didn’t target her at all. Quina soon understood her condition and seemed to have given up on hearing from Zefmate.  Her gaze turned to us.  </p>
<p>『Quina.  I’ll explain it to you, so let Zefmate rest for a moment』</p>
<p>(I was expecting Master-san to say that. </p>
<p>『I’m begging you, please be gentle』</p>
<p>  When Quina asked me about it, I was sure she’d talk about anything. Umm, there was no way he could feel a chill!  </p>
<p>「Zefmate.  I’ll escort you in the rest, so you should take a break」</p>
<p>「Understood, I understand...」</p>
<p>  Zefmate nodded back in response to Quina’s words and, with an unsteady gait, he headed to the corner of the room and fell asleep on the spot. It was the same room as Mea, the master, but she didn’t have time to worry about it. </p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Huh~h」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>  From the room and the shadows, I heard a fifth concert of sleep. Is it because the citizens were concerned about it that the room was strangely quiet outside?  No, it seemed that some of the citizens had fallen asleep. I guess those who could move were originally people with high magic power and little exhaustion.  </p>
<p>(So?  What’s the situation here?)</p>
<p>『How should I start explaining it...?』</p>
<p>(If possible, from the beginning)</p>
<p>『Well, it’s briefly, but let’s start with an explanation』</p>
<p>We have time anyway.</p>
