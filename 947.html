</div><h1>Chapter 947</h1><p>Isario simply continued to defend, but the antidemons kept collapsing. As I observed this, I tried to use all my senses to determine the intertwining process. Then I noticed that the insides of the antidemons were unusually high. Apparently, the internal temperature increased little by little, and the antidemons were kept burning from the inside. Humans would probably be in pain to the point that they could fall over, but antidemons without pain can keep fighting until death. Humans would probably be inflicted intense pain that would make them fall over, but antidemons without pain can keep fighting until death.  This was not an efficient way to fight against antidemons, I don’t think......  No, it seems that the antidemons don’t notice any abnormalities inside because they don’t feel pain. It must be a good thing for Isario that they don’t have to worry about letting them escape.  Three more minutes later, Isario was completely surrounded by a swarm of antidemons.  They were surrounded by more than 10,000 enemies on all sides and endlessly attacked. Is he planning to keep on defending and slowly burning us to death?  The high fever probably killed about 500 of them, but it was still a long time ahead.  I’m sure he could win at Isario’s level eventually, but he was way too leisurely. As I was watching Isario’s battle with doubts, I suddenly sensed something approaching from behind.  There was no sign of life, and I only felt a small hint of something with mass slashing through the wind and coming towards us.  If we hadn’t been careful because it was a battlefield, we would have been even slower to notice. We hurriedly turned around, thinking that it was some kind of long-range attack.  But there was something unexpected.  It was not an attack, but a person. No, it was an opponent in human form.  White skin and silver hair.  It looked more fitting to call it too well-rounded than a beautiful woman. I couldn’t feel any signs or emotions from it. The one who approached us was the golem, the Silver Lady, created by the Divine blacksmith Zechs. She stopped in front of us with a behavior that did not sense inertia and started talking in a flat voice without changing her expression. </p>
<p>「Long time no see」</p>
<p>「... Nn.  Do you have something to do?」</p>
<p>「Yes.  I had something to tell you, and I was looking for it. But now I have even more priority」</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>「It’s better to leave this place as soon as possible. I’ll get caught up in Ignis’s attack.」</p>
<p>「!」</p>
<p>  Immediately after the Silver Lady shouted a warning.  The red sword, which stood out from a distance, emitted an intense light. It seemed that the Divine Sword had been released. Red flashes of light covered the wilderness, and a torrent of magical power with physical pressure blew the antidemons away.  When the raging red light subsided, a mass of flames was in Isario’s hand. Although it was a divine flame, it looked much different from the other divine swords in their released state.  However, the strength of its power was exactly worthy of the name of the divine sword.  Even at this distance, it was already hot. Moreover, I could see the temperature in the surrounding area rising at a tremendous pace.  </p>
<p>『Fran! It’s just like the Silver Lady said.  This is not good!』</p>
<p>「Nn. I’ll leave」</p>
<p>「I think that’s better choice」</p>
<p>  Following the Silver Lady who had started moving first, we moved away from Isario. Even after nearly 200 meters away, the Silver Lady did not stop yet. And then another 200 meters.  And finally, the Silver Lady stopped flying.  </p>
<p>「I have to go this far?」</p>
<p>「Yes.  The impact won’t be completely erased here either. But based on our past data, it won’t be a problem at this distance」</p>
<p>「Have you ever seen Isario’s Divine Swords many times?」</p>
<p>「I have been observing the large-scale battles taking place on this continent as much as possible.」</p>
<p> As part of their support for Overgrowth’s equipment, they had been gathering information on antidemons and other strong people at all times.  And Isario was the strongest person who had been fighting on this continent for many years. Naturally, the amount of battle data they had gathered was enormous, and I had seen the power of the Brilliant Flame Sword Ignis many times before. Therefore, it was said that it was possible to predict to a certain extent.  </p>
<p>「Use yourself as bait to gather antidemons and defeat them all at once with Ignis’s power. I will use this pattern with a high probability when Isario the Red lotus blade is going to annihilate them」</p>
<p>  We looked down at the battlefield while listening to the Silver Lady’s explanation. There, we saw a crimson light swirling around, covering the battlefield.  It was beautiful at first glance, but inside, it was hell.  The Divine Flames that Ignis had unleashed swallowed and dissipated the antidemons one after another. It was far more powerful than Extreme Magic. The red circle, which was nearly a 100-meter radius, melted the earth and the antidemons, and the heat released was even burning over a wide area. The temperature around Fran increased and began to sweat slightly on her forehead.  It was indeed too close to before.  If it hadn’t been for a barrier, she would have been burned. But...  This was the Divine Sword. staring at the burning earth, we once again realized the tremendousness of the Divine Sword.  Fran opened her mouth as she looked down at the earth, which was red-hot and molten. </p>
<p>「Speaking of which, did you say something you want to tell me?」</p>
<p>「Yes.  Please be careful」</p>
<p>「Advise?」</p>
<p>「Please be careful of Silard.Certainly, it was too close to before. If it hadn’t been for a barrier, it would have burnt down. I wouldn’t have died if it hadn’t been for that... But this is what a Divine Sword is. staring at the burning earth, we once again realized the tremendousness of the Divine Sword. Fran opened her mouth, looking down at the earth that was red-hot and molten. </p>
<p>「Speaking of which, did you say something you want to tell me?」</p>
<p>「Yes. Please be careful」</p>
<p>「Advise?」</p>
<p>「Please be careful of Silard. If he proves to be useful to his country, it will surely be troublesome」</p>
