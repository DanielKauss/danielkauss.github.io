</div><h1>Chapter 940</h1><p>「I’m done with my self-introduction, so I’m begging you.」</p>
<p>「Please do?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. Actually, the town of Brutori, east of Nocta, is about to be attacked by antidemons.」</p>
<p>「Those who scouted it out told me that even within a few days, more than 100,000 antidemons would attack Brutori.」</p>
<p> The antidemons were still gathering from the surrounding area, and it was predicted that they would attack us all at once when the number of antidemons increased a little. The antidemons were still coming from the surrounding area, and it was predicted that they would attack Brutori all at once when the number of antidemons increased a little. </p>
<p>「Just like Sendia?」</p>
<p> I wondered if there was something else going on, but that was not the case this time.  </p>
<p>「Unlike Sendia, it’s probably a natural occurrence.  It’s not as big of a threat as the Sendia defense, but Brutori is not a big town. If things continue like this, it’ll surely collapse.」</p>
<p>「Wait, I don’t want you to go there to rescue us.  With the help of everyone here, I can save you」</p>
<p>  That was our joint request with the Divine Sword wielders.  Or do we need Fran? Three divine swords would be enough.  But it seems not that easy.  Isario was an adventurer, but he was also a legendary figure on this continent. Even if he moved, that would not be a simple achievement of the Adventurers Guild. So, they wanted to accompany such adventurers on this quest.  They wanted to spread the word that there were other promising shares besides Isario, and that they were working properly.  They didn’t seem to be using it like they’re doing just fine, but the reward was good. It’s in cash, not in points.  It was, more importantly, a chance to see the battle of the divine sword users up close. There was no way Fran could miss such an opportunity.  </p>
<p>「Okay, I’ll take that request」</p>
<p>  She answered immediately. And then, one hour after accepting the request from the Adventurers Guild, Fran was at the east gate of Nocta.  There were many adventurers waiting around it.  They had shoved the leader of the Adventurers Guild from the guildmaster.  They refused at first, didn’t they?  But the only high-ranking adventurer was bear Diggins except Fran. And there was no way he could leave Fran to be the commander of the unit.  I wondered if Isario was here, but it seems that his dad had always been on this continent with a promise that he would move solo. So even the guild couldn’t restrain his actions. In the end, there was no other suitable person, so Fran had no choice but to be the commander.  The other adventurers had already heard rumors of Fran, and hardly anyone complained. Still, those who complained were no longer there because Diggins, the self-governing vice-commander, had silenced them.  Fran was also strangely motivated, so she had no choice but to command the adventurers.  </p>
<p>「The holy knight.」</p>
<p>『Yeah, it looks pretty decent.』</p>
<p>Rescuing Brutori was staffed by adventurers, knights of the Holy Nation of Silard, soldiers of the Militant Nation of Hagane, and Isario.  They were mainly composed of the two great powers and Isario, and the adventurers were treated as if they had been defeated afterwards.  The fact that they fought together was probably what was important.  The Order of Holy Knights’ hundred members looked quite normal compared to the people I saw in Sendia.  They were in a tight formation and had no private words. For better or worse, they were just ordinary knights.  However, their combat power was probably lower than that of those I’d seen in Sendia. Maybe they were knight-commanders too.  However, they had a similar personality, since they clearly looked down on adventurers. It would be impossible for us to work with them, and I’d rather prefer to be treated as a rearguard.  The soldiers of the Militant Nation of Hagane seemed to be having a hard time working together in a different way than the holy knights.  We were also standing side by side without any words. However, there was something amazing about the fervor within us.  It may even be better than the holy knights because they didn’t look down on adventurers...  But they were more willing to do it. I guess the old soldiers here were feeling the same way they were holding adventurers back. </p>
<p>「How are you feeling?  Young lady」</p>
<p>「Isario.  What’s that weird thing?」</p>
<p>「It’s terrible to be strange.  It’s a magic tool, you know?」</p>
<p>  The reason Fran said something strange was because of the board Isario had on his back. Well, it was certainly a tool Fran wasn’t familiar with.  However, I could imagine how to use it.  Well, it was because it was on Earth though.  </p>
<p>「This is a magic tool for moving around, you know?  It floats a little when I ride on it and pour my magic power. I can’t fly to the sky, but it’s convenient」</p>
<p>「It floats」</p>
<p>「Yeah.  Uncle can’t beat the passing of age these days. He’s tired from running a little, so it’s come in handy」</p>
<p>  I don’t know how true it was, but it seemed to be a Skateboard-like item.  There were no wheels, so it could be lifted slightly from the ground. It was like a hobar, maybe?  Well, an ordinary adventurer would probably eat it. I was sure that her eyes would sparkle and she would look like </p>
<p>「Amazing!」</p>
<p>  However, Fran’s reaction was completely different from what I would have expected.  </p>
<p>「Hmm」</p>
<p>「...Is that all?」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>  For Fran, who has plenty of ways to go around the sky, with her telekinetic air rides and aerial jumps, using Urushi, a magic tool that floats a little in the air is not worthy of surprise. In fact, the look on her face was like </p>
<p>「That’s all I’d expect」</p>
<p>.  </p>
<p>「They’re pretty popular with the little ones wherever they go, aren’t they? You’ll just have to ride it on it and they’ll surround me」</p>
<p>  Isario seemed to have been trying to surprise Fran, who was expressionless and cute. I guess he was thinking of winning respect from her a little.  An old man who looked good was scurrying around with his cheeks widened. On the other hand, Fran wanted to go get more hands on Isario.  </p>
<p>(Master)</p>
<p>『Want to show you the trouble?』</p>
<p>(I’m sure Master is more amazing than that board)</p>
<p>『Well, that’s fine』</p>
<p>「Nn.  Isario, you’re watching me」</p>
<p>「Okay?」</p>
<p>  Fran called out to Isario and threw me into the air. Fran jumped up in the air, chasing after me as I spun around and flew in the air.  The moment Fran put her foot on the ground in the air, I activated my telekinesis. The power was being suppressed, but I made a quick move in front of Isario.  </p>
<p>「Ooh! That sword flies in the air!」</p>
<p>「Fufun.  The best sword」</p>
<p>  Isario’s reaction when he saw Fran running in the air like a surfer on a telekinetic air ride was like that of a child. However, his analysis skills were ridiculous.  </p>
<p>「I see, I see.  My telekinetic ability makes me fly through the air...」</p>
<p> At first glance, it seemed that he had figured out how telekinetic air rides work.  </p>
<p>「The idea of flying on a sword stems from where you start. So those geniuses are no different」</p>
<p>「Fufun, the greatest sword」</p>
<p> Isario’s reaction when he saw Fran running in the air like a surfer on a telekinetic air ride was like that of a child. However, his analysis skills were ridiculous. </p>
<p>「I see, I’m using my telekinetic ability to fly through the air...」</p>
<p> At first glance, he seemed to have realized how the telekinetic air ride worked. </p>
<p>「The idea of flying on a sword came from somewhere. So those geniuses are no different」</p>
<p> Isario’s voice seemed to be filled with serious envy.</p>
