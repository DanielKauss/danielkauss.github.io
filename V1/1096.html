</div><h1>Chapter 1096</h1><p>「Now, what I want to ask you to do this time is to search for Raydoss’s scout, and to uncover a nobleman living in the royal capital who might be rebelling against the country」</p>
<p>「Sophie, you say the nobles were caught?」</p>
<p>Grandma Esmeralda, who suddenly started telling us what she wanted, was quite shocked by what she had to say. Fran was also confused.</p>
<p>It’s still fine to look for a spy. They would just barely be in the adventurer’s category. But would it be a job to ask adventurers to find any nobles who rebelled against the country?</p>
<p>「Don’t tell me you shouldn’t be leading the way, young miss? We just don’t have enough forces, so I’m going to use whatever you can use. Besides, you don’t need to hide it」</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>「Here. Originally, I heard that it was the information you got, right?」</p>
<p>What Esmeralda took out was a sheet of paper. It looked like a list of something, with the letters sludgling on it.</p>
<p>I took a closer look at it and realized that. This list was pretty close to the list of slavers we had gotten.</p>
<p>That was expected to be the case. It was said that only the names of nobles and merchants from the Kranzel Kingdom were extracted from that customer list.</p>
<p>「Gyaahaha. I gave it to you at the right time. Nowadays, there’s not many idiots who would crush it, and thanks to your name, it’s more believable. You’d better not think about it like you did before」</p>
<p>Something is being overestimated huh!? She seems to think that I kept it in my storage until we got higher in rank.</p>
<p>「It was the perfect time. Kukuku. The trafficking in illegal slaves is forbidden by the laws of the nation. I wanted to destroy that very thing. I could give you a good reason.」</p>
<p>「But it would be chaos if this many noble families were to be destroyed at once...」</p>
<p>Esmeralda laughed away at the maid’s words.</p>
<p>「Huh! So what’s wrong? The darkness got much warmer as I was drinking my tea gracefully. That’s why they licked me. But you’re scared of me, right? If I go against the darkness, I won’t be able to do anything. Letting people think of it that way will serve as a deterrent and help stabilize our country」</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>「But that’s not it! You must kill all your enemies! I’ll crush any doubts! If you’re suspicious, thoroughly investigate! That’s what’s going on in the shadows! Why are you accusing me of my words? A little girl.」</p>
<p>「......Hiii!」</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>For a moment, Esmeralda released a tremendous killing intent. She released a dense, deep, deep-sea, deposit-like killing intent. The maiden, who seemed to be a decently high-ranking person even in the dark, even trembled with her face turned pale.</p>
<p>Fran braced herself for a moment too. As one would expect from a former commander in the dark, he was very intimidating. I guess the way he looked weak meant that he was a disguise that we couldn’t see through.</p>
<p>「It was really bad, young miss. You’ve been disciplined too well by these young girls after all. I guess we have to discipline them all the time.」</p>
<p>「Nn, I’m fine」</p>
<p>「Y-Y-Y-Y-Y-Yeeees! I’m surprised you didn’t change your complexion at all!」</p>
<p>「Is that more of a request?」</p>
<p>「Oh yeah, that’s right. The old man shouldn’t prolong their conversation. His men have been pretty wiped out after Ashtner’s stupid incident. However, there are still many nobles in the royal capital who are still connected to Raidos. It is very likely that they are protecting Raidos’ scout. Is this close?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「I’d like to destroy the nobles who were lying down in Raidos, but it will take a long time to get a private detective. If that’s the case, I can crush them with different suspicions. That’s what this list is about」</p>
<p>I see. So we’re gonna catch him on suspicion of trafficking in illegal slaves, rather than on suspicion of interrogation with Raydoss.</p>
<p>「It has the fighting ability and stealth skills. I also know about the list, so there’s no problem with the information. If at all possible, I would like you to accept my request, but what do you think?」</p>
<p>Esmeralda sent us a request form. From the looks of it, it should be no problem.</p>
<p>(Master, can we?)</p>
<p>『Yeah. They’re the ones we’re talking to.』</p>
<p>The nobles involved in the trafficking of slaves must have been enemies on par with Raidos to Fran. They would rather that than crushing them against the background of their nation’s power.</p>
<p>It was inevitable that Fran would want to accept this request.</p>
<p>「...Okay, I’ll accept the request」</p>
<p>「Thank you very much!」</p>
<p>Still, it’s only been a few days since we provided the list. Were they backlashing or done? Esmeralda grinned when Fran raised a question.</p>
<p>「There were still signs of a formal contract on that note. It was not just a letter with the name of the customer, but a magic note. Well, it must have been used to threaten the nobility eventually.」</p>
<p>We didn’t understand, but it seems that an alchemist could read many things.</p>
<p>Moreover, the sign and seal on it were said to be the same as the contract we had previously sealed with the slavers. The Kranzel Kingdom had judged that it was as reliable as possible.</p>
<p>Besides, all the nobles on the list were originally members of the Marquis Ashtner’s faction. The government was looking for an excuse to intervene. It seemed that it wanted to destroy some of the nobles, even if they were rather difficult to deal with.</p>
<p>「Can I tell you that much?」</p>
<p>「It’s fine for me. I’m half of the people involved, and I’ll be working for you this time as well. Nice to meet you」</p>
<p>「Nn. I’ll leave it to you」</p>
<p>Esmeralda seemed to be planning to make a move immediately. She threw something at her.</p>
<p>「Young miss, I’m wearing that now」</p>
<p>「What’s this?」</p>
<p>「That’s a mask that has the effect of blocking perception」</p>
<p>The name of the mask was not one to wear to one’s mouth, but one of the venetian mask types that covered one’s eyes. It was jet-black with a gold border that tickled two hearts inside.</p>
<p>「It doesn’t have any defense, but I can’t remember his face anymore. It’s not a good thing that the nobles resent him. It’s time to wear it」</p>
<p>「Okay」</p>
<p>『This is a good item.』</p>
<p>I was wondering how to disguise it, but it was resolved at once.</p>
<p>「We’ll return it to you when the request is over. It’s a very dangerous item to use」</p>
<p>『Yeah.』</p>
<p>She really wanted an assassin or something.</p>
<p>「First of all, I’d like you to visit a nobleman’s mansion, who has been acting suspiciously lately」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「She’s going to crush me anyway. I can just go easy on her」</p>
<p>「Understood」</p>
<p>『Wait! We have to hold back!』</p>
<p>(?)</p>
<p>If Fran didn’t go easy on them, there’d be more injuries to the mansion!</p>
