</div><h1>Chapter 1135</h1><p>After destroying the Crimson Flame Knights, we left Forrund, who had exhausted his power, to Urushi and headed for the undead army behind.</p>
<p>But thanks to the light of the white protection that surrounded them, the adventurers were at a loss. But the soldiers of the nobility were somewhat perplexed.</p>
<p>Was it because only the adventurers had been suddenly enhanced? When I thought about it, that was not all.</p>
<p>「Why are they trying to kill each other?」</p>
<p>「Attack both of you!」</p>
<p>「I-is that so?」</p>
<p>It was because of Avenger we had brought with us! She seemed to be confused when she saw the ghouls attacking the undead.</p>
<p>But even so, the undead army was beginning to lose its advantage.</p>
<p>「Avenger! You betrayed him!」</p>
<p>「Fuhahaha! We have a new God’s revelation!」</p>
<p>「I was not in my original sanity, but I’m even crazier! How about your loyalty to the Kingdom of Raidos, who created us!」</p>
<p>「Even though Raidos is only manipulated from the beginning, there is not a hint of loyalty in him! In fact, the hatred we carry is actually the one that Raidos created and possessed!」</p>
<p>It seems that Avenger had successfully eliminated the commander of the undead army called Scavenger.</p>
<p>It seems that despite his low fighting ability, this scavenger had powerful necromancy abilities and the Physical Simultaneous Manipulation skill that was created after his research on Hydeman.</p>
<p>It was an undead that was created with the concept of endlessly multiplying and continuously taking command, allowing me to increase myself as much as I want.</p>
<p>Both Scavenger and Avenger were inferior in overall strength to their superiors, but they seemed to have superior performance in a single point.</p>
<p>However, this guy acted like a platoon captain or company captain, not a commander. The undead army was led by a large undead with a clearly large body.</p>
<p>It’s a completely naked demon with two horns on its head. It’s probably an ogre undead, not a demonkin. However, its skin is as black as charcoal, and I can’t find any signs of sexual intercourse. Because of this, it looks like a doll.</p>
<p>This was Chardman, the fifth seat of the Black Skeleton Corps, an undead specialized in combat who controlled explosions. Well, not even the commander, but the scavengers were actually in charge of it.</p>
<p>However, there was no doubt that the undead army was gaining momentum because of Chardman leading the way.</p>
<p>I was going to eliminate that, but――</p>
<p>「Nuooh! Explosive Fire Fist!」</p>
<p>「Doraaaaaah! Intimidation, Wrath, and Dance!」</p>
<p>Two demons were trying to kill each other.</p>
<p>Against the jet-black ghost demons, there was a demonkin clad in white light.</p>
<p>Chardman and Donadrond paused to exchange strikes. This was no tricky battle, just a dodge and slash.</p>
<p>They slammed each other one after another with their regenerative abilities to heal their wounds, confirm their survival, and then strike each other again. Such a primordial exchange of lives unfolded in the middle of the strange void between the undead and the adventurers.</p>
<p>「You can’t let them get away with it! Let’s make effective use of your Heavenly Body!」</p>
<p>「Don’t lose! I won’t lose for the sake of my comrades!」</p>
<p>Chardman was bigger than I had heard in advance, and he had probably higher fighting prowess, wasn’t he? It seems there was something that even Avenger didn’t know about.</p>
<p>Its body was covered with flames, and explosions occurred every time it was hit. In addition, explosions occurred behind it during attacks, and they seemed to be accelerated by the backlash of that explosion.</p>
<p>Her weapon was her fist, but the power of each blow was probably at the level of being able to shatter huge rocks.</p>
<p>I wonder how strong Donad is, since he was only slightly injured in a head-on attack like that.</p>
<p>It would be difficult to coordinate without knowing what kind of abilities they had. With that as an excuse, I appraised Donadrond.</p>

<p>『So it mutates!?』</p>
<p>Apparently demonkin don’t evolve, but they can mutate themselves. The reason Ashwrath got the Mad Ogre skill, which was also the trigger for his outbursts, was because he had mutated into a Calamity Demon.</p>
<p>I had heard that this mutation was not caused by level, but by various things... But I didn’t expect that donad would mutate it. Moreover, it looked like it was not a dangerous mutation like Ashwrath’s.</p>
<p>My stats have gone up a lot, and so have my regeneration and other skills. Back when we first met, Chardman must have killed me instantly in Donadrond.</p>
<p>That’s what allowed us to fight head-on.</p>
<p>Gradually, however, his formation leaned toward Chardman. Judging from his name and skills, this Donadrond guardian demon was probably a race that had the power to protect his comrades.</p>
<p>Compared to our defense, our offense power didn’t increase much. Well, we’ve been strengthened a few notches too, but it seems to be less than enough to defeat Chardman.</p>
<p>Fran then moved to a position where she could see from Donad. Then she lightly held me up so that she could see me. That was probably what Donad was saying while we were about to join in our support.</p>
<p>Then Donad shook his head lightly.</p>
<p>You saying you don’t need support?</p>
<p>Fran and Donad stared at each other for a moment. Then, Fran attacked the undead around her instead of Chardman.</p>
<p>『Are you sure?』</p>
<p>(Nn. Donad has something in mind. So, it’s okay.)</p>
<p>『I see. Let’s at least destroy the undead so that they can fight more easily』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>As we were defeating the undead, the battle between Donadrond and Chardman finally lost its balance. Chardman’s fist blew him away, and then the explosive magic of flames exploded as a chase.</p>
<p>「Ora ora ora! This is the end of it! Blow them up into pieces!」</p>
<p>She managed to get up, but the donad was not putting enough strength into her knees. If things continue like this, she’ll get stopped! But just after I thought that.</p>
<p>「......The antidemon law.」</p>
<p>「Gugaaaaah!」</p>
<p>Donad muttered something at that moment. Without any change, countless holes had opened in Chardman’s body.</p>
<p>「W-What the...... shit, Ghaah......」</p>
<p>Immediately after Chardman’s misdeeds, his body exploded. After all, he was no longer regenerating. It was the end of a monstrous mass of power that unites the undead.</p>
<p>No, what happened? I’m sure Donad did something...</p>
<p>「Donad is amazing!」</p>
<p>『Y-yeah.』</p>
<p>Anyway, it was surprisingly settled in an instant.</p>
