</div><h1>Chapter 1070</h1><p>「Fran, why don’t you just decide not to see it and retreat?」</p>
<p>「I don’t want to fight you. Please」</p>
<p>「......Why do you want to kill the villagers?」</p>
<p>「That is――」</p>
<p>「The prince! We don’t have any time to question him! What’s wrong with the little girl! You were fighting until just now, weren’t you?」</p>
<p>「If it was the Wind Demon, I’d have defeated it」</p>
<p>「Kuh. Even though you were just a child who had just received a demon, you should be reasonably strong in the sky...... Your existence is not for our country! I will eliminate you!」</p>
<p>The demon knight shouted and held up his spear. But Pune and Ronowe also braced themselves and moved into a battle stance. They were now surrounded by three demons. But Fran didn’t seem to pressure them at all.</p>
<p>「Fran, surrender!」</p>
<p>「I leave it to you!」</p>
<p>「......So you give up on killing the villagers?」</p>
<p>「I can’t do that」</p>
<p>「Then I’ll refuse.」</p>
<p>The moment Fran refused Fran’s words, the demon knight started chanting magic. Fran and Satya were still perplexed, but the demon had started to move.</p>
<p>「Kill them!」</p>
<p>(If we fight here, a lot of people from the village will die. So, before it becomes a battle, we must win!)</p>
<p>『Got it! Urushi, take out the demons from the princes!』</p>
<p>(Grr!)</p>
<p>「Brilliant Lightning Rush, Sword God Transformation, Black Lightning God’s Claw!」</p>
<p>Fran stepped forward at once, while using her skills. Black lightning overflowed from Fran’s body, showing an acceleration that even left an afterimage.</p>
<p>I’m going to give it everything I’ve got to give it my all in an instant.</p>
<p>『Great Magic-User, Divine Energy Manipulation, Evil Conquest...!』</p>
<p>Magic and Evil Spirits welled up from inside me. I’ve gotten used to the evil spirits, too. Without getting attacked by the cold air like before, I mixed the power I drew out and clothed it on my blade.</p>
<p>Divine, evil, and black lightning mixed together, an indescribable evil power enveloped me. I could definitely feel the blade being whittled down and the blade being worn out.</p>
<p>In fact, my durability value had decreased at a tremendous rate. But I was sure that it was strong.</p>
<p>The flame magic that the demon knight unleashed also burst with a single swing. Fran then thinned out to the demon knight, scraping the residue of the flames that were flying like sparks.</p>
<p>「That is――」</p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>The demon knight’s eyes widened in response to the tremendous force that suddenly erupted from Fran. Even so, it was impressive that he was able to react and thrust his spear out. There was no way that such a spur-of-the-moment attack would hit him.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time the demon knight thrusts its spear out, its body was slashed by the slash.</p>
<p>A few moments after Fran passed by it at a ridiculous speed, the body of the demon knight slid and his torso fell to the ground.</p>
<p>「Don’t let your guard down, we shouldn’t...」</p>
<p>「You can’t let them get away!」</p>
<p>Defeat the demon before it is released. This is the must-have strategy for demon knights. Well, it takes attack power to instantly defeat the demon knights, who are strong enough in their bare state though.</p>
<p>That would have already stopped us from discussing our plan. Fran didn’t stop and moved on to her next goal, staring at the dumbfounded prince by calling the demon knight’s name.</p>
<p>The culprits are not the princes themselves, but the demons they control.</p>
<p>(This way first!)</p>
<p>『How is it, Ronowe!?』</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
<p>Fran slashed at Ronowe, the female-type demon in her vicinity.</p>
<p>Urushi acted as a feint, unleashing weak deadly poison magic at Fran and Satya. In response, Brunnen used his body as a shield to block it, but Ronowe did not move on the spot and transformed his arms into long tentacles to block it.</p>
<p>Seeing this, he must have decided that it was Ronoue who would be troublesome to leave him alone.</p>
<p>She quickly entered her bosom with that god-speed and slammed me into her leg. She was too tall to even reach her torso.</p>
<p>A deadly slash severed Ronowe’s leg, and his body was――</p>
<p>『What?』</p>
<p>「Keho.」</p>
<p>What’s more, purple spots appeared on Fran’s face.</p>
<p>It was poison. It seemed that Ronowe could transform his body into poison mist. It must have been Ronowe’s poison that killed the Raydoss soldiers on the way.</p>
<p>What was also terrifying was that it had broken through Fran’s resistance to abnormal conditions and had given her a deadly poison. So, Fran should have smelled only a little bit of Ronowe’s poison.</p>
<p>So to speak of this power...... Well, as long as we know that poison is coming, we can deal with it. I can absorb it with my poison control skills, or I can easily heal it with healing magic. Well, it’s just for Fran though.</p>
<p>If Ronowe tried to massacre the villagers with poison, it would be doubtful that we would be able to recover in time. And more and more, we had to kill Ronowe first.</p>
<p>But before we could do that, we had to try something else. I concentrated my thunderbolt magic as far as possible and fired it at him.</p>
<p>I was targeting a magic stone in the center of the plaza. It’s obviously gonna have some effect. A bullet of lightning struck the magic stone, enough to inflict damage even to a dragonkin.</p>
<p>But nothing happened. That magic stone. It was not only hard, but also seemed to be protected by a magic barrier. I didn’t expect it to not even be trembling.</p>
<p>「It’s useless, I won’t let it get destroyed」</p>
<p>「Frut! Satya! What happened?」</p>
<p>「...Fran, I’ll ask you one more time. Can you please retreat?」</p>
<p>「It won’t retreat.」</p>
<p>「......Satia can use poison! While I’m holding back Fran!」</p>
<p>「Understood!」</p>
<p>It seems that they had decided that they wanted to attract Fran and kill the people with Ronowe’s poison. I felt a strong determination that we had to destroy the villagers no matter what.</p>
<p>「Kuh! I won’t let you!」</p>
<p>「Wooo~f!」</p>
<p>Fran had fired several slashes at him, but Ronowe’s entire body had already been covered in poison.</p>
<p>『Then let’s do this!』</p>
<p>「Woooof!」</p>
<p>It seemed that in the middle of the poison mist, Ronowe’s resistance to flame magic and lightning magic had decreased. As the fog around him burned, Ronowe appeared again and screamed.</p>
<p>「Woof! Get him!」</p>
<p>『Fran! What a pathetic thing to do!』</p>
<p>「Uroooogh!」</p>
<p>Phantom disappeared and appeared behind Fran, with Shadow Transfer. Fran managed to deflect the hilt of the great scythe wielding her huge body, but it was quickly blown away behind her.</p>
<p>『Telekinesis? Be careful! You’re pretty strong!』</p>
<p>(Got it!)</p>
<p>It seemed that Pune could use some very powerful telekinesis. I tried to use telekinesis on my own, but I could only weaken it.</p>
<p>「Gugyii......」</p>
<p>「Haaaah...」</p>
<p>This was bad! Ronowe’s poison managed to poison the villagers! I scattered detoxification spells on the spur of the moment, but it seemed that we made it in time.</p>
<p>「You said you’ve already been poisoned?」</p>
<p>Satya was astonished to think that Fran had used detoxification magic in an instant. However, if things continue like this, the villagers will eventually suffer. If things continue like this, it can’t be helped!</p>
<p>『Urushi! Attack Satya herself! Don’t kill her! I’ll do it for you!』</p>
<p>(Woof!)</p>
<p>The only way to clear it up quickly was to shut up her main body.</p>
