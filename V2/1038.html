</div><h1>Chapter 1038</h1><p>The skill “Permanent loyalty”, which seemed to be a clue for me to stay away from going crazy. I don’t want to use it as it is because it has the effect of making me look like the slave of the Lord. However, what if Announcer-san could help me to adjust it to something good? I’m not sure if I can do it, and I always rely on her for this, but I have no choice but to rely on her for this. It is an important foothold in whether I can stay with Fran as her partner. As Fran’s partner, this is an important foothold in whether she can stay with us or not.  </p>
<p>「A Divine Sword Magic-User......  Could you be a person from the Kingdom of Philias?」</p>
<p> When you think of a Divine Sword that manipulates demons, all I think of is that name...  </p>
<p>「No, that’s not it.  I know Diaz of Philias, but he looked different from that」</p>
<p> In other words, does he mean that there are other divine swords other than Diaz that are capable of manipulating demons?  </p>
<p>「The wielder is a human man.  As I said before, I don’t know the name of the wielder.  But I know the Divine Sword he was using.  His wielder was the </p>
<p>『Grand Gate Sword, Hell.』</p>
<p>  It was a divine sword that could control various kinds of poisons. However, it also seemed to have the ability to defeat demons and take advantage of their power.」</p>
<p> Poisons and demons.  They seemed to be similar, and I don’t know the relationship between them. No, from the name of the prison sword, it must be an ability to open the gate to hell.  I don’t know if there is a hell in this world.  However, according to the legends of Earth, the demons live in hell.  In that case, it would not be surprising if the prison sword was able to take advantage of the demon’s power. </p>
<p>「Her wielder was a gentleman with golden-silver eyes and blond hair and black skin, just like a male prostitute.」</p>
<p>「What the hell is that?」</p>
<p> It was Seliadot who reacted to Trismegistus’ words. His eyes immediately sharpened and he spoke to Trismegistus as if he was about to take a bite out of him.  </p>
<p>「Where is he now!?」</p>
<p>「I don’t know him.」</p>
<p>  Trismegistus’ attitude was not the same, probably because he did not recognize Seliadot. But Seliadot was not frightened.  </p>
<p>「Yeah, no doubt! He’s the poison user who destroyed our country!」</p>
<p>  So he really was her enemy, huh?  A powerful poison user who obeyed many illegal slaves.  Well, that means the lorelei will lose. I didn’t expect him to be a Divine Sword user.  </p>
<p>「No clue what he’s after? </p>
<p>「You wanted power.  At first, I heard about the Golden Dragon Sword, Eldrad. They heard that he was originally struck for me.」</p>
<p>「And Eldrad is the sword for Trismegistus?」</p>
<p>「Indeed.」</p>
<p> Eldrad was said to be a Divine Sword made for Trismegistus to fight the Abyss Eater.  The Golden Dragonmen and the Golden Dragon Sword. They certainly seem to be compatible with each other.  Besides, the life expectancy of the price was not a problem for Trismegistus, who was immortal due to Divine Punishment. So, I was uncomfortable with the price of a Divine Sword made by Ulmer. </p>
<p>「Then, why didn’t you use it?」</p>
<p>「I couldn’t equip it.  Ulmer said that she refused to use my Eldorado.  When we parted ways, she told me to take good care of Juanaverta... I remember how that happened.」</p>
<p>  Did Trismegistus back then say that he didn’t need Eldorado because he had Juanaverta, and that he refused to use the Divine Sword?  It was just like Fran, wasn’t he?This meant that Trismegistus back then refused to use the divine sword because he had Juanaverta, right?  It was just like Fran, who said that she didn’t need the divine sword.  But it would be even more terrifying than I had imagined for him to live forever. Fran looked at Trismegistus with a sad look on her face.  </p>
<p>「And that girl came here with a girl.  She was like a slave, but she was from the same race as that girl」</p>
<p>  A poisonous user with a lorelei, huh? No doubt about it.  </p>
<p>「...... Fine.  It is enough just to know that we have come to this continent.  Besides, it is also possible that the black market slavers are connected to each other. You can follow their steps from there.」</p>
<p>  Seliadot mumbled, looking down to suppress his emotions. His appearance, combined with the emptyness of Trismegistus in front of him, gave him an indescribable aura. Isario was impressed because he could intervene.  </p>
<p>「I don’t know what’s going on with the Ward Dealer, but can we just continue talking about them for the time being?」</p>
<p>「I’m sorry.  I got a little distraught.」</p>
<p>「Good. Isario shrugged his shoulders and smiled bitterly as he said that.  As he said so, he had a lot of things on his hands. I guess that’s why he felt strangely suggestive.  </p>
<p>「Well, Trismegistus-san. I’ve heard that the Abyss Eater has become weaker, but do you know what kind of effect it will have on the future?」</p>
<p>「Yes.  First, antidemons will not be born for a few days.  And there is no doubt that antidemons will be weakened, even if it’s only for a short period of time. My calculations show that it will take about 30 years」</p>
<p>「30 years?  What a short period of time...?  Well, it’s just for you, isn’t it too short」</p>
<p>「There’s a high possibility that the antidemon season won’t occur during that time」</p>
<p>「Well, we can do everything now」</p>
<p> I had thought that it would only reduce the time it took for Trismegistus to defeat the Abyss Eater a little, but the impact was far greater than I had imagined.  It would be much easier to spend just by weakening the antidemons, but the antidemon season will end for a while? It was good news for each city.  But things were not that easy. Isario and Jayne looked a little irritated for some reason. </p>
<p>「We’ll only cause a ruckus if other countries find out about this, okay?」</p>
<p>「...... If 30 years of peace and quiet continue, the number of people coming to this continent will increase, you know? That could cause an explosion in the number of people.」</p>
<p>  It’s not enough to make the people living now safer. More people would come to this continent, and the probability of death would be reduced.  In that case, it wouldn’t be surprising if the number of people increased drastically. There was a possibility that they would temporarily increase their forces and prevail against antidemons.  But what if the Abyss Eaters recovered and returned to the same situation 30 years later? They might have a large amount of bait. In the long run, this could be a minus. </p>
<p>「You wished for the death of many people this time, but what are you going to do if there are more people again?」</p>
<p>「Of course, I’m sure the number of people will decrease as well. In the absence of a Divine Sword user, creating strong antidemons would be a risk, but you have to thin out the layers to reap the benefit of the Abyss Eater.」</p>
<p> The number of people will keep increasing, benefiting the Abyss Eater.」</p>
<p>「So that even if they can’t escape from the castle barrier, that’s possible?」</p>
<p>「By observing the failed divine sword, I have completed the design of a magic tool to create powerful antidemons. I will be able to do the same thing on my own now.」</p>
<p>  Oh, come to think of it, this guy was a genius alchemist. I don’t understand the theory, but it seems I can create a tool to create huge antidemons.  </p>
<p>「Isario and Jayne.  You all must warn the nations.  Stop using your self-absorbed logic to interfere with my mission. Now that the world is about to be destroyed」</p>
<p>「... It is impossible to convince each country」</p>
<p>「Next time the Abyss Eater is released, I don’t know if the Gods will save them, you know? For his beings, a person is only worth that much」</p>
<p>  I thought you wouldn’t say Trismegistus’ words, but I was somewhat convinced. The legends of the Gods were somewhat dry and were often far from merciless.  Trismegistus’ words were probably correct, except for the strange Gods like the Goddess of Chaos.  That’s why I don’t want to punish the Gods, and it’s quite appropriate.  I’m not very interested in them. I guess the natural Gods have a strong tendency for that.  </p>
<p>「It’s a mortal thing to do as you say, but I can’t say that...  By using this continent, you may be considered to have used the Abyss Eater and, in turn, the Evil God Fragments. Let’s check it out by such a way.」</p>
<p>「It’s been a long time since I’ve used the connection in its full strength...  Haah, that’s tedious, but I guess it can’t be helped.」</p>
<p>  If Trismegistus can’t be ruled out, there is only one thing we can do. In the end, we had to change the way countries use this continent as we pleased.  As Isario and the others were discussing something with grim faces, a magic circle suddenly appeared right next to the throne. Out of it came a chair very similar to Trismegistus’ throne and a woman sitting on it.  </p>
<p>「This is......?」</p>
<p>「The Gods have just given me the information. A new sinner, Merit, shall we welcome you?」</p>
<p>「Trismegistus!  So, this is a castle!  When did you......?」</p>
<p>  She said that she was going to fight antidemons with Divine Punishment. Is she really going to let him fight alongside Trismegistus?  I don’t think there’s any way Merritte, who hates dragonkin, could fight alongside him.  On the contrary, it could get in his way. Isn’t that a world crisis......?  But I soon realized that was unfounded. Merritte began to suffer right in front of me.  </p>
<p>「Giii!  Agaaah!」</p>
<p>「The moment you think about interfering with my mission, you will suffer a great deal of pain.」</p>
<p>「Ggiii, Gigiii......!」</p>
<p>「This goes for those who fail to fulfill their mission and are lazy.」</p>
<p>「Gigiii......!  D-Damn...」</p>
<p>「Me too, it was the same at first, but I know right away that it is in vain. The pain won’t make me resistant to it.」</p>
<p>  Hearing Trismegistus’ words, he seemed to have given up on interfering with him.  The hint of pain disappeared from Merritte’s face. As long as he didn’t think badly, he should be fine.  </p>
<p>「...... Damn!  Shit shit shit shit shit shit, shit!  I won’t give up! One day, I’ll destroy you and the dragonkin!」</p>
<p>「Once the mission is accomplished, we’ll be free. If that feeling lingers at that time, we can do whatever we want.」</p>
<p>「No matter how many years have passed, I will never forget this feeling!  Never!」</p>
<p>  Mertritte shouted with a horrifying expression and glared at Trismegistus.</p>
<p>「......Damn! Shit shit shit shit shit shit! I won’t give up! One day, I’ll destroy you and the dragonkin!」</p>
<p>「Once the mission is accomplished, we’ll be free. If that feeling lingers at that time, we can do whatever we want.」</p>
<p>「No matter how many years have passed, I will never forget this feeling! Never!」</p>
<p> Mertritte shouted with a horrifying expression and glared at Trismegistus. Trismegistus, on the other hand, continued his hatred with an expressionless expression.</p>
