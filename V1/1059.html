</div><h1>Chapter 1059</h1><p>Fran and Urushi, who had begun action to rescue their acquaintances, rushed to their side at once using teleportation.</p>
<p>The Raydoss soldiers were in complete chaos when the girl and the wolf suddenly appeared and began to attack the surroundings. While Fran and Urushi’s attacks blew the nearby soldiers away, I activated several of my land spells.</p>
<p>『Great Wall!』</p>
<p>We had surrounded all sides of the captives with walls and separated them from the surrounding Raydoss soldiers. Inside the wall, there was enough room to rest even if Urushi became huge.</p>
<p>Because of this, the soldiers of Raidos were still inside, but we quickly eliminated them. We only had to paralyze one of them, since there seemed to be someone important.</p>
<p>Outside the wall, the Raydoss soldiers were screaming and screaming. At this rate, it will take some time for them to break through the walls.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the handcuffs on the adventurers’ limbs were not magic tools. Besides, the slave collars had not yet been used.</p>
<p>As Fran cut off the shackles on their limbs, she began to remove the gagged legs on her own.</p>
<p>「Guys! Are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Fran-san? Why are you here......?」</p>
<p>「I came to help.」</p>
<p>When Fran told them so, the adventurers let out a gasp of relief. Jugeon hugged his fellow adventurers, while Maia hugged Lydia and shouted with cheers. The others seemed to be relieved as well.</p>
<p>Judith thanked Fran with tears build up in the corners of her eyes.</p>
<p>「Thank you, very much.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>When Fran snapped her back, she killed her voice and began to tremble. She must have been worried for a long time.</p>
<p>I wanted to keep Judith quiet at this rate, but there was no time to delay.</p>
<p>『Fran. Our priority right now is to get out of here』</p>
<p>(Yeah.)</p>
<p>Besides, there was not enough people that Fran wanted to save.</p>
<p>「What about Charlotte?」</p>
<p>「That’s why they took me somewhere else...」</p>
<p>「...Oi」</p>
<p>「Hyaah!」</p>
<p>I raised an important person who had been paralyzed and interrogated him. Since it was an emergency, we quickly went through a rough interrogation, but it can’t be helped, right?</p>
<p>My fellow adventurers were back a little, but we got what we wanted.</p>
<p>Raidos Kingdom, which had acquired Charlotte’s special skill, seemed to have captured her in the central building of the town. Although only the upper echelons of the invasion army knew about her purpose, they were captured in the center of the town along with the other captives.</p>
<p>The adventurers here had been planning to ship them to the Raidos Kingdom and enslave them.</p>
<p>『Let’s just let them escape for now』</p>
<p>「Nn. Guys, ride on Urushi」</p>
<p>「U-understood」</p>
<p>Fran urged him to ride on the back of the giant Urushi.</p>
<p>Many hesitated, but as soon as the Scarlet Maidens took the initiative to climb up on Urushi, their guard seemed to have faded. They all began to ascend on Urushi’s back.</p>
<p>The adventurers in Barbra had known Urushi for a while now. They must have realized that he was a wolf who had been fooling around cooking while waving around beside Fran.</p>
<p>Urushi’s back is very tense, but I wonder if it’ll be okay? Please hold on to his fur.</p>
<p>「Urushi, please」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Urushi began to move slowly so as not to swing the adventurers on his back. It would be dangerous to suddenly run up at an angle, so he had to increase his altitude little by little.</p>
<p>It’s still a good thing we’re on the ground at this rate, so Fran and I will remain as decoys.</p>
<p>『Let’s go!』</p>
<p>「Nn! Phew――Shii!」</p>
<p>Fran swung me from within the wall. The slashed Great Wall slowly fell in all directions.</p>
<p>「I-I’m going back down!」</p>
<p>「Ugyaaah!」</p>
<p>With a shivering tremor, I heard the screams of the soldiers and the blunt sound of something crushing. The sudden tragedy has frozen the soldiers of the Kingdom of Raidos.</p>
<p>But Fran had no mercy for him.</p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>She leapt into the soldiers in front of her, cutting down the soldiers one after another.</p>
<p>「Teyaa!」</p>
<p>『Eat this! Burst Flame!』</p>
<p>I also chose the most flashy spells possible to confuse the soldiers.</p>
<p>Sporadic attacks were fired at Urushi, but gradually, the attacks on the ground were focused on Fran.</p>
<p>We’re worried about their flying force now. The adventurers on their backs would be in danger if they were attacked from all sides by flying magic beasts other than Lesser lock.</p>
<p>But what if there was a commotion in the harbor that caused continuous fire? They would surely come to us.</p>
<p>『Let’s be even more flashy!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Fran went on a rampage to protect her comrades, to dissipate her anger at the Kingdom of Raidos that had been smoking inside of her.</p>
<p>They slashed, slashed, and even threw away the soldiers who rushed into them. Sometimes, they even used a variety of magic to blow them away.</p>
<p>As I had expected, soldiers were still coming from all over the town, but no matter how many soldiers there were, they couldn’t stop Fran.</p>
<p>「Gyaaah!」</p>
<p>「Shiit! Why is there such a little girl!」</p>
<p>The invasion continued.</p>
<p>「Pain, Pain, Pain!」</p>
<p>「I don’t want to die――」</p>
