</div><h1>Chapter 967</h1><p>Three days have passed since we were forced to obtain the consent of Silard, the Holy Nation. Several troops from various countries were dispatched to Nocta one after another. Soldiers who could not enter the town had set up tents outside the gate and were even waiting there. Near the south gate, nearly 500 tents of all sizes were lined up, and the smoke was cooking in front of it. I don’t know the exact number of adventurers, but there were about 1,000 dragonkin dispatched from each settlement in total. In addition, 4,000 knights and soldiers from various countries responded to the call. In addition, about 4,000 knights and soldiers from the country responded to the call. I’ve also heard that some of the weaker countries dispatched about ten people to cook their tea, so it was impossible to say how many people were from any country in general.Apparently, some of the weaker countries sent about 10 people to cook their tea, so they couldn’t say exactly how many people came from any country.  Moreover, not all the armies were gathered in Nocta.  Five other towns were chosen as gathering points, and more than 30,000 troops seemed to be moving in total.  Moreover, this was only about half of the expected number. This was because the battle with the giant-type had already caused a lot of damage.  Nocta, Sendia, and Brutori were able to be defeated with little damage. However, of course, not all the towns were able to defeat it well. Some towns have succeeded in defeating the giant-types that appeared with reinforcements from dragonkin and from the outside the barrier. Some giant-types were said to start moving when their amniotic fluid lost a certain level or higher, and others were still asleep. However, more than half of them had started moving, and they were still on a rampage all over the continent.  Soldiers and knights from various countries had been severely injured, and many countries did not have enough strength at all. On the contrary, some countries, including generals and commanders, had been completely wiped out. Some of the higher up in the administrative council had also arrived in Nocta, and were currently discussing their future actions.  Generals and captains of various countries, as well as a few dragonkin generals. There were also high-ranking adventurers such as Isario and Fran, as well as representatives of the mercenaries.  There were about 50 people in total.  They rented the first floor of a medical facility in the same shape as the tower, and were now gathering there.  The Sanatorium was apparently shaped like a tower on this continent, though it was rare to find someone as big and influential as Sendia.They rented the first floor of a medical facility in the same shape as the tower, and we were now gathering there.  It seems that the Sanatorium was shaped like a tower on this continent.  It was as big as Sendia and rare to find someone with authority.  The floor was supposed to be used as a waiting room for patients, so it was plenty in size.  However, the long chairs were difficult to move, so they were used as they were.However, the long chair was used as it was, and it was difficult to move.  It was like sitting in a room similar to the waiting room of a large hospital on Earth, with serious looking men in armor.  Besides, these men were somewhat ridiculous and desperate to hold back their laughs.  It was strangely surreal that they had almost no say in it. Representatives of the small and medium-sized countries were sitting around here, unable to disobey the decisions of the major powers.  I guess they really wanted to let them know the results later. But they had to attend the meeting as a representative of the country, and they couldn’t doze off.  Some knights were even tying their thighs with serious looks on their faces, waking up to sleep. I’m sure there were only about a dozen or three people in total who were raising their voices during the meeting.  Oh, Fran still had the right to speak. After all, Fran was not just a simple adventurer.  The current Fran was also treated as a representative of the Kingdom of Belios.  She was now attending the meeting with Admiral Brunen.  The Kingdom of Belios itself was not as big as the two major powers on the northern continent, but it was classified as a major country by the world.  The country’s power was high, and the navy was quite strong.  Well, once every few years the navy had almost no work other than sending troops to Gordisia. However, since the Academy of Magic was in the country, it was thought to be stronger than it actually was.  Besides, there were a very large number of military magicians.  There was no doubt that they were a small number of elites.And now, in addition to Fran, the aliased adventurer, she was also the employer of the Dimitris school, led by a Rank A adventurer.  This time, even though she did not bring much ordinary power, she had a large number of high-ranking personnel who could be active in the front lines.  The Kingdom of Belios was one of the five important countries in this conference.  Well, even so, it was not as good as Snorabbit or the demonkin countries led by the strong Queen herself.  Besides, when she moved later, Fran would work as someone from the Adventurer’s Guild. Hiltoria and the others were likely to do so as well.  Still, they were begging Belios because Brunen had asked them to do so. Considering the national interest, they probably wanted to insist that their country had provided them with a great force.  The members of the council were William, the muscular elf and disciple of Weena Rhyn. He was also a consultant in magic, and apparently, he was even more important than we had imagined. Basically, it was led by the administrative council and approved by the other organizations.  The action plan for the forces gathered was to create several elite troops and destroy the giants around Nocta. The other groups would focus on scouting, gathering information, and providing support for the various places.  There were also no dragonkin from the northern reservations.  It was not that they were not called, but that they did not respond to the call. When the message came, the dragonkin in the northern reservations had suddenly disappeared.  They were, as expected, under the Dragon King’s command. And it was more likely that they were involved in this incident.  When I looked at the troops announced after the meeting, of course, Fran was an elite group. The other adventurers that we met were Mea, Hilt, Colbert, and Diggins.  They also had the names of the Holy Nation of Silard, the Divine Sword-owning Nation of the Militant Nation of Hagane, as well as dwarves, demonkin, and their queens. The names of the dragonkin Chelsea, the mercenary Tzaluta Camellia, and the knight Yagilale were on it. They looked reliable, but they also thought that their superiors had to gather this much power.He looked pretty reliable, but it also meant that their superiors believed that they needed to have this much strength.  The normal way to deal with the situation was to send troops out from around the point where the giant-type appeared and defeat them based on the number of troops.  However, this time they were trying to gather forces together over a period of three days.  They probably judged that it was meaningless to clash with the smaller forces.</p>
