</div><h1>Chapter 975</h1><p>Our new giant-type was approaching us, facing the giant-type from the west. It was running at a tremendous pace. </p>
<p>「You?」</p>
<p>「I won’t be able to make it in time!」</p>
<p>『That’s right!』</p>
<p> It seemed that it would take a while for the ritual spell to be completed by the Militant Nation of Hagane. Isario was completely dependent on the giant-type of Shallus. What should we do? Will we have to rely on Isario’s Divine Sword Release for the time being? But that would be too much for Isario. But that would be too much for Isario.  </p>
<p>「... I’ll do it!」</p>
<p>『Isn’t that the only thing we can do!?』</p>
<p>  The only thing we could do was to defeat the newly emerged giant-type.  It would be best if he could defeat it, but he had grown up just like the giant-type of Shallus. I wonder if we would be enough to defeat them all... But things progressed even before we could even start moving. </p>
<p>「Rooooooooourgh!」</p>
<p>「Ruoourgh!」</p>
<p>  The giant-types suddenly began to roar. Their outlines twisted as if noise was running, and began to crumble as if melting.  Isario tried to check them out, but that did not stop the change. Their magic power was probably being cut somewhat, but that was all.  In less than ten seconds, the two giant-types lost their physical form like black mist. At first glance, it seemed to be disappearing, but it was obvious that it was not.  The black mist began to flow as if it had a will of its own.  It seemed that the black mist was attracted to each other. Two black mists joined together, swirling and becoming a lump. What was going on?  A number of rays of light were emitted from the Militant Nation of Hagane, which had completed its ritual magic, and several explosions occurred inside and outside the black mist.  However, they didn’t seem to work. In fact, the life force and magic that I could sense had not diminished.  </p>
<p>「Tsk!  Burn them up!」</p>
<p>  Perhaps sensing a sense of urgency, Isario turned to attack in earnest.  He didn’t try to pin her, but to pause and shoot.  There were ten fireballs more than ten meters in diameter.  They poured down on the black mist and then a huge explosion occurred. A considerable amount of black mist then dissipated, leaving behind a large amount of mana.  However, the swirling black mist did not stop moving. Rather, it accelerated its movement even as if it was a tornado. </p>
<p>「Ruuaaaaaaah...」</p>
<p>  The battlefield then echoed with the voice of a giant again.  I could feel a huge mass wriggling in the black mist. It seems that a new giant-type was being created.  In all likelihood, it is a fusion-type. </p>
<p>「Uuaaaaaaaaaahhhh!」</p>
<p>『S-So it’s getting bigger!』</p>
<p>「Magic power is also amazing!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  A new giant-type appeared from the rapidly thinning mist.  It was even taller than the giant-type from Should. It probably had more magic power.  Moreover, the transformation did not end there. Its body swelled at a tremendous pace, making a rattling sound. It was as if a shock had been blown into a rubber ball at once.  Its body, which was already huge, was even bigger.  It was about 50% taller than the Should’s giant-type, huh?  It was probably more than twice the volume. Its arms and legs were even thicker and longer. </p>
<p>「Braaaaaaaaah!」</p>
<p>  But what grew the most was the magic and evil contained in it.  It had jumped up nearly three times over that of the giant shorz-type, which was already a monster. If Isario hadn’t been chipping away at it, I would have become even stronger......  </p>
<p>「Get out of here!」</p>
<p>  We had never even heard Isario’s shouts before.  But it was no wonder. The super giant-type swung down its arm and fired a magic bullet. It was a huge magical and evil-looking shot, about 20 meters in diameter. If it were to hit directly, the second unit might be annihilated.  Isario’s flames would not be able to reach us in time. I used my land magic to create the wall, but I didn’t think I could block it. I quickly tried to lower the power of my attack with magic power absorption and evil manipulation, but the power was only slightly reduced.  </p>
<p>「...!」</p>
<p>  This was really bad.  I could feel Fran’s frustration. But all I could do was to build more walls with land magic, even if I knew that the burning stone was water.  In front of us, the earth wall that had touched the magic bullet disappeared as if it were vaporized.  At this rate――But the situation that I was afraid of did not come true. Just before we landed at the second unit, the huge magic bullets suddenly withered and disappeared.  </p>
<p>「Eh?」</p>
<p>『What is it?』</p>
<p> It really was an event for a moment, and I don’t know what had happened.  And for the past few minutes, the sudden developments had been so sudden that I’m constantly surprised! </p>
<p>「Mazyuku」</p>
<p>  As Fran looked in her direction, she descended from the carriage and held up a straight black sword. It was a long sword, everything from the blade to the blade, as if it had sucked all the light.  No doubt about it.  That must be the Divine Sword Berserk.  It was so intimidating that she wanted to get away from it quickly even though it was tens of meters away. In fact, some of the adventurers and knights right next to them were lost or were about to run away.  It was not because they were afraid of the giant magic bullets.  Their attention was on Berserk. They must have been confused by the sudden appearance of Berserk nearby. However, the old soldiers of the Hagane Kingdom did not seem to be afraid at all and surrounded them as if they were trying to protect their Mastelier.  There was no sign of them starting to go out of control.  It seems that they have not yet released their Divine Swords. I had heard that they would die if they used it, but that they would die if they used it, so they wouldn’t die if they just waved it in their normal state.  Even Ignis had given Isario a variety of abilities, such as flame magic, even if he didn’t release it.  Was it an absorption-type power?  No, rather, it seemed to be more of a cancelation? It was as if I had dissipated my energy and erased it.  I don’t know if Berserk’s ability or Berserk’s ability to strengthen the power of the Great Magic Beast, but it must be a very powerful ability to erase that attack in almost an instant.  In addition, Maserk shoved Berserk’s tip into the ground and put his forehead on the hilt. His appearance made him look like a saintess praying to the Gods.  However, the presence emanating from her was exactly the opposite of her fleeting strength. I could sense a vicious and ferocious magical power swirling around us, as if it had appeared in a disaster-class magic beast.  The adventurers around us became more and more cautious.  The giant-type, on the other hand, grunted and lifted his arms again.  He was going to ignore Isario and kick the soldiers away, but he was probably angry at being disturbed. It seemed to have a lot of human or rather, biological intelligence and emotions.  Magic power emanated from his entire body and he braced himself to release more magic bullets than before.  </p>
<p>「Bruaaaaaah――?」</p>
<p>  However, his movements stopped soon, and a confused grunt rose. After closer inspection, I could see that her right leg, which looked like a giant tower, was gradually discolored black.  Before I knew it, Berserk had released several kinds of magic power like an obi and was wrapped around the legs of the giant. </p>
<p>「Bughaaaaah...!」</p>
<p>「He’s dead」</p>
<p> The muttering of the maste‍r was heard strangely loud, as only the roars of the giant-type echoed through the battlefield.  And then the legs of the giant-type faded with tremendous force. The figure of its right leg, which had faded black and became thin and weak as if the plants were dead, was truly bizarre. The giant-type was swinging its arms around to support its body, but it was unable to support its huge body, which had lost its balance rapidly.  Finally, its right leg snapped with a thud, and the giant-type collapsed on its back. Moreover, strangely enough, there was no sign of regeneration of its broken right leg. As Mastegi’s </p>
<p>「dead」</p>
<p>  muttered, it was as if only its right leg had died.  We’ve been using regeneration-inhibiting life magic ever since the beginning of the battle. It didn’t seem to work on the giant-type, but...  I guess that’s a divine sword. Even without being released, it has overwhelming power.  However, the backlash was also great.  </p>
<p>「...!」</p>
<p>  As soon as she tried to get up, Fran swung her head wildly and fell to one knee again.As the word “dead” implies, it was as if only her right leg had died. We’ve been using regeneration-inhibiting life magic ever since the start of the battle. It didn’t seem to work on the giant-type though... I guess that’s what a divine sword is. Even without being released, it has overwhelming power. However, the backlash was also great. </p>
<p>「...!」</p>
<p> As soon as she tried to get up, Fran swung her head wildly and fell to one knee again. Her face was pale, showing that her exhaustion was extraordinary.</p>
