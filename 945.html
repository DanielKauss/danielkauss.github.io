</div><h1>Chapter 945</h1><p>I thought the antidemons had been eradicated by Ader and the defense had ended, but the battle was not over yet.</p>
<p>The gate on the opposite side of the city informed us that antidemons were starting to gather again.</p>
<p>They were not yet moving, but they seemed to start moving in a few hours.</p>
<p>I think it’s a good idea to know exactly what antidemons are going to do, but after many years of scouting on this continent, I’ve become somewhat familiar with antidemons.</p>
<p>That’s fewer than before, but I’m sure it’s not less than 10,000.</p>
<p>I thought it was Isario’s turn to answer this, but Militant Nation of Hagane said they would take care of it. Don’t tell me, would they use a divine sword?</p>
<p>When we went with Fran to check the situation, we found that the spearmen of General Hagane were leaving in a formation. We could also see a carriage in the rear of the soldiers.</p>
<p>「You’re not intercepting us?」</p>
<p>『I guess they’re planning to do it on their own.』</p>
<p>If there are too few of them against an enemy, the best way would be to get support from the town and deploy troops near the city walls.</p>
<p>However, the soldiers of General Hagane were dashing away from the wall. If we could get any further distance, we would not be able to provide them with support.</p>
<p>This was the same as Silard. Apparently, they didn’t need any support. Was it because they were going to use a Divine Sword after all? Then I could see that they were trying to leave the town.</p>
<p>After all, Berserk was on a rampage. If we use the Divine Sword Release near the castle gate, we would destroy the Brutori who came to protect us.</p>
<p>In fact, I’ve heard that there was such an incident in the past.</p>
<p>But what about those old soldiers? If Berserk were to be used, we would have no enemy or friend to deal with. But wouldn’t the soldiers get caught up in that?</p>
<p>While we were wondering, the troops of General Hagane were steadily leaving.</p>
<p>「Master, let’s chase them.」</p>
<p>『Yeah, Urushi, please let me know if there is a movement.』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>With Urushi’s legs and teleportation, we could teleport for a moment, even if we were a little farther away. If an antidemon appeared from the other direction, they would immediately call us over.</p>
<p>「Let’s go」</p>
<p>『Yeah!』</p>
<p>Leaving the town guards to Urushi, we watched the battle of General Hagane from the sky.</p>
<p>We were about 200 meters away from the antidemons. Once we stopped at that spot, the soldiers began to prepare for the battle.</p>
<p>Four women, including Shikimi, Hydrangea, and another one, came out of the carriage.</p>
<p>The woman at first sight looked just like you. Maybe she was a sister too. The hydrangeas seemed to have a higher position than us in terms of how we treat the hydrangeas and the sea lions.</p>
<p>If we considered you as their commander, then I guess the hydrangea and the mantis were the wielders of the divine sword.</p>
<p>The carriage they were riding on seemed to have a special structure, as the hydrangeas climbed onto the roof of the carriage using the stairs folded in the rear.</p>
<p>If chairs were set up there, it would feel like a simple spectator area.</p>
<p>A hydrangea and a snowman were sitting in a line, and the other woman stood behind them. Looks like a bodyguard.</p>
<p>She then approached the soldiers and started shouting. She said she was going to lead the soldiers and fight the antidemons.</p>
<p>『Looks like you haven’t used a Divine Sword huh?』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p>There’s also the fact that she can’t use a Divine Sword against an enemy of this level, and the extent of her use is probably very limited considering the life of the wielder.</p>
<p>Three minutes later.</p>
<p>Finally, a new end to the war between the antidemons and the Militant Nation of Hagane was opened.</p>
<p>1,000 old soldiers from the Kingdom of Hagane, clad in black, intercepted the wave of antidemons in a clean circle.</p>
<p>I was not nervous at all when fighting the dwarves, but I was worried when I saw the Hagane soldiers. I know they were strong to some extent, but they were all old soldiers in light gear.</p>
<p>But they were stronger than we had expected. Their level of coordination was also incredible. Their movements were not dull, and I could feel the precision of a Drone controlled by artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>And yet, they were still filled with fighting spirit.</p>
<p>「Show them what we can do!」</p>
<p>「Defeating enemies even if they die!」</p>
<p>「Nuooh!」</p>
<p>All of them were fighting desperately, proud of themselves. What was more unique about them was that they didn’t seem to be afraid of death at all.</p>
<p>I felt the urge to die, but she didn’t seem to be afraid to die herself. It was as if she only saw her life as one of her pieces.</p>
<p>Since she was like that, she naturally thought of her friends as her piece of work. However, if one of her friends next to her collapsed, she could feel frustrated and moan.</p>
<p>But that didn’t slow them down or slow them down. Even though they were frustrated at the loss of their lives, they were not afraid of death.</p>
<p>This was a strange army. I wonder how could they get someone with the mentality they deserve.</p>
<p>However, they didn’t seem to be manipulated or discouraged. Obviously, they fought on their own and offered their lives as pieces.</p>
<p>Some of them lost their lives as they fought against about 20,000 antidemons. However, the old soldiers continued to fight without stopping, and finally defeated the commander.</p>
<p>To be honest, I didn’t expect that.</p>
<p>Even though they were not very powerful fighters, they did not expect them to be able to defeat their commander, as they were only capable of powers at a lower rank of D or C in the individual level.</p>
<p>I thought you would be the only one to take care of the commander, but the old soldiers fought to the very end. We were also surprised by the last attack.</p>
<p>To their surprise, the old soldiers used a suicide bomb attack. They used a very small range attack magic that sacrificed several lives. Using this, they destroyed the commander’s core with precision.</p>
<p>They could win against an opponent that was usually half-destructible by their troops with only a few sacrifices. I guess we could call it an ant or a small fry, but...</p>
<p>「......Amazing.」</p>
<p>『Yeah. But don’t do that, Fran, okay? I can’t do that, and I don’t want you to』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Until the very end, they had treated their lives as pieces of victory, right in front of the hydrangeas who stared at them without changing their expressions.</p>
