</div><h1>Chapter 960</h1><p>After defeating the giant antidemons, something else occurred again before Fran and the others could move in.</p>
<p>Even though the strength of the stones varied, they still swayed to the ground over and over again.</p>
<p>And then I saw the dust flying far away and the huge shadow standing inside it.</p>
<p>「The same as here?」</p>
<p>「Maybe. I don’t think I need five or six of them because of the tremor. Besides, the one who looks closest to me」</p>
<p>「Huh?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, I think it’s similar to Brutoria.」</p>
<p>Fran growled at Isario’s words. It was probably because she didn’t think Brutori’s forces would be enough to defeat the giant antidemons.</p>
<p>In fact, it looked like an instant kill because of the offensive power of Isario and Ignis, but they were too troublesome opponents if we fought them normally.</p>
<p>「......What should we do?」</p>
<p>Normally, Fran would listen to me for opinions, but now she was looking up at Isario next to her. I-I’m not really jealous of her, am I?</p>
<p>It’s not a bad thing for Fran to be able to rely on adults other than me. That’s just how far the ties and rings with people Fran has with her are expanding.</p>
<p>I felt a little lonely though. But more than that, I was happy that Fran was able to interact with people.</p>
<p>「Well, let’s go back. I can’t just abandon Brutori.」</p>
<p>「Okay」</p>
<p>Isario, who had been fighting on this continent for many years, knew for sure that he would not be able to leave many people behind.</p>
<p>Fran nodded happily at those words, so we’d have no choice but to go back here.</p>
<p>「Let’s hurry then, shall we?」</p>
<p>「Nn! Urushi, do your best!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Isario jumped on a moving board and poured magic power into it. Immediately after, he began to accelerate at once at a tremendous speed. He suddenly began to advance at high speed from a stopped state, and it looked a little like a toy.</p>
<p>However, the speed was at a level that I couldn’t laugh at. Not only was it a toy, but it was probably even faster than an F1 car. Urushi called out to her in a panic as he was staring at Isario who had disappeared in no time.</p>
<p>『Urushi! Let’s go!』</p>
<p>「W-woof!」</p>
<p>Urushi was desperately chasing after Isario’s board as it slipped through the ground with a flame blast. Urushi was serious too. But still, he couldn’t catch up with Isario easily.</p>
<p>After using enhancement magic and continuous healing magic, Urushi finally reached the back of the pack with all his might.</p>
<p>「Young miss! Don’t push yourself too hard, just come later!」</p>
<p>「Okay!」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>Urushi was getting stronger, but he must have pushed himself quite hard. Worst case scenario, I have to get Isario first?</p>
<p>Just as I was thinking that, Urushi messed it up. For Urushi, who had left Fran’s leg to himself, he couldn’t stand to lose to the magic tool at the speed of his movement.</p>
<p>Even when Fran and I warned him not to do anything rash, he didn’t slow down.</p>
<p>She breathed so wildly that I thought she might spit out the blood, desperately swallowing the sourness that it gushed up, and ran to the very end.</p>
<p>She stopped once about 100 meters in front of Brutori and immediately collapsed. Because of her shortness of breath, the timing of her chest moving up and down was irregular.</p>
<p>「Zeez... Zezeez...... Gof......」</p>
<p>「This girl’s servant is amazing! I was serious, right? I never thought I’d be following her to the end!」</p>
<p>「Urushi, I tried my best」</p>
<p>「Zeha......」</p>
<p>「You don’t have to make a voice.」</p>
<p>『Urushi, rest until you calm down. It was amazing』</p>
<p>(Woof.)</p>
<p>Urushi fell down and went into the shadows for a rest. He must have pushed himself so hard that he didn’t even have the strength to stand.</p>
<p>But thanks to that, we were back at Brutori before dusk.</p>
<p>We saw a huge antidemon across the city. It was dressed like a fetal and enveloped in a strange liquid.</p>
<p>It was probably less than 300 meters away from the city. It was no exaggeration to say that it was close in the middle of a wide continent.</p>
<p>「Not many soldiers were on the top of the wall.」</p>
<p>「A lot of antidemons!」</p>
<p>「The fact that the big monsters aren’t moving means there’s a swarm of antidemons here as well. It looks like they’re still fighting at the other side’s gate. So, hurry!」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>The two of them paused once to escape from the city at once, partly because Urushi had reached his limit.</p>
<p>Isario’s board could not move high in the sky, so he had to move on his own.</p>
<p>Isario emitted flames from the soles of his feet and back, then jumped up at once. It must be the multiple activations of the Vernier that Mea had been attacking.</p>
<p>By combining instantaneous acceleration and jump, the two entered the city at once. Fran also followed Isario, who was running through the roofs of the houses in her aerial jump.</p>
<p>「Lots of people are sitting around.」</p>
<p>「They must have sucked out my magic power. The rest is, I guess, Evil Spirits.」</p>
<p>They couldn’t resist the magic absorption power of the giant antidemons, and quickly lost their magic power. Because of this, they seemed to have some anemic effect. In addition, the dense evil emitted by the giant antidemons covered the city, and they were also sickened.</p>
<p>Maybe their resistance to evil spirits had decreased because they had lost a lot of magic power.</p>
<p>But with the exhaustion of magic power and the Evil Spirit, we couldn’t do anything about it either. Fran and Isario hurried past the people who sat down powerlessly and headed for the giant antidemons.</p>
<p>The closer we got to the gate, the more people were sitting on it, and some of them were lying on the ground. The closer we got to the giant antidemons, the more mana they absorbed.</p>
<p>With that kind of power flowing all over the city, I couldn’t even imagine how much power was flowing into the giant antidemons.</p>
<p>「At this rate, everyone is in danger」</p>
<p>「Yeah. That big monster is going to eat one of the towns. If we defeat it as quickly as we can, people in the town will eventually die of exhaustion」</p>
