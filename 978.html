</div><h1>Chapter 978</h1><p>As a result of our search for Barhar, we did not get the desired amount of food. The only thing we found was a magic circle emitting evil energy.</p>
<p>This time, I also called Isario and Zelos Reed to check it out. Well, I was not an expert, so I didn’t know much about it.</p>
<p>In the end, we eliminated the evil crystals and killed the Evil Berserker instantly.</p>
<p>Isario and you were discussing our plans for the future.</p>
<p>「We should consider ourselves as having annihilated all the giant types we had originally planned. What should we do now?」</p>
<p>「That’s right. There are no other rescue requests from the other troops, right?」</p>
<p>「Yes. Well, the towns around here are almost destroyed, so maybe we won’t be able to get in touch with them」</p>
<p>「Even so, I’m sure you’ll send him a quick run. He won’t complain if he does whatever he wants without instructions」</p>
<p>「Very well then――」</p>
<p>「Yeah―」</p>
<p>As we were talking, we noticed a group approaching us. We flew up to check it and saw about 500 troops approaching us.</p>
<p>The fact that they were a combination of adventurers, knights, and soldiers suggested that they were rescue teams formed in each city, just like us. They must have come from a different city than us.</p>
<p>The commanders then came in contact with them.</p>
<p>They came to see what happened to Barhar. It seems that the residents of Barhar had escaped slightly and asked for help in the vicinity.</p>
<p>After discussing it with them, Isario and Zelos Reed decided to hand over the refugees to them here. Our troops overwhelmingly outweighed them in terms of combat power, and we decided that it would be better for the continent if the second troops were freed.</p>
<p>The second unit was now freed, but there was someone who had made new contact with them. No, it was more correct to contact Fran than to call the unit.</p>
<p>It was right after we handed over the guards of the residents of Sende to the rescue division.</p>
<p>We sensed something else approaching us again. It was moving at a tremendous speed. Maybe a message or something?</p>
<p>No, it wasn’t an emissary. They were clearly cloaked in evil energy, but there was no sign of antidemons. They were neither fiends――or anything.</p>
<p>These were dragonkin. They emitted evil energy. Isario and Zelos Reed knew the evil dragonkin existed, and did not immediately launch any long-range attacks on them.</p>
<p>But we remained cautious and waited for the evil dragonkin. That’s when we realized the true identity of our presence.</p>
<p>The evil radiating from its body was much stronger than before, but it was definitely Frederick. He didn’t seem to be running, but rather using his wings to glide over the earth’s surface.</p>
<p>Frederick didn’t have wings in the past, did he? Velmeria did, but...</p>
<p>「Frederick.」</p>
<p>「Young miss, do you know him?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Even when they found out that Fran was an acquaintance, Isario and scimitars remained vigilant. Some of the dragonkin were acting as close to black as possible, and that evil energy was still there. It couldn’t be helped.</p>
<p>This was so dense with evil that I thought it might have been bestowed power by sacrificing it to the Evil God.</p>
<p>Frederick must have known that he was giving off a hint of suspicion. He let his wings flutter once and stopped in front of the second unit with a sudden braking.</p>
<p>He then raised his hands toward us to show that he had no hostility. Isario and Zelos Reed remained vigilant even after that, probably because of Frederick’s floating expression.</p>
<p>Frederick’s face was clearly not calm. Whether it was anger, impatience, or a different feeling. His eyebrows were frown, holding back so much emotion that it was obvious at first sight.</p>
<p>Even so, he remained calm. Frederick slowly opened his mouth and didn’t seem to try to provoke us.</p>
<p>「......Even though he looks like this, I have no intention of harming him. However, there was an urgent need for Black Lightning Princess-dono there, so I made contact with him in this way while disrespecting him」</p>
<p>Isario was the one Frederick was talking to. I guess he was appealing to someone in this group that had the potential to instantly kill him that he was not an enemy.</p>
<p>「......Well, I guess it’s not so bad.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Frederick’s okay. What’s wrong? What about Velmeria?」</p>
<p>「Black Lightning Princess...... please! Help Velmeria!」</p>
<p>Fran tilted her head at the fact that Velmeria was nowhere to be seen, but Frederick suddenly got down on his knees. I thought he was calm, but it seems he was being cornered.</p>
<p>「What do you mean?」</p>
<p>「Velmeria had been captured by the Dragon King......」</p>
<p>Frederick recounted what had happened in the past few days.</p>
<p>「We were looking for the Dragon King’s location to rescue Velmeria’s mother......」</p>
<p>「Mom, were you captured by the Dragon King?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, you’re right...」</p>
<p>Velmeria’s mother, Tilanaria, was apparently in the Dragon King’s quarters in the south. However, she had been taken away by the Dragon King in the north after being attacked by them. At that time, they said something about their connection to the Dragon King.</p>
<p>The two went around crushing the leaders of the Dragon King Syndicate and the slavers, gathering information on Tilanaria. As a result, the Dragon King was convinced that Trismegistus was connected in some way.</p>
<p>「I don’t know if Trismegistus and Tilanaria-sama were working together or just trying to use it, but...」</p>
<p>Velmeria and Frederick were convinced that their mother had been taken away to the center of the continent and went to rescue her. However, the unusually strong dragonkin interrupted them and captured Velmeria. Moreover, they were also attacked by antidemons at the same time.</p>
<p>In order to escape from the crisis, Frederick seemed to have used the abilities of a half-evil dragonkin to purposely absorb the evil energy and increase its power.</p>
<p>I guess we were close to the limit of what could happen with Evil Spirits.</p>
<p>Frederick’s smug atmosphere was probably due to his anger and impatience, but also his evil energy.</p>
<p>「I could only escape, but... Velmeria had been taken away!」</p>
<p>「Is the dragonkin that strong?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. They were always on the level of high-ranking warriors. Besides...」</p>
<p>「Is that so?」</p>
<p>「Umm, antidemons......」</p>
<p>Frederick ended his words there. Apparently, he was not confident in his remarks. However, he quickly squeezed it out and said what he felt.</p>
<p>「That antidemon...... It was as if the dragonkin were manipulating the antidemons......」</p>
<p>Neither Fran nor I laughed off those stupid stories. We felt a shiver run down the antidemons as the Dragon King conveniently appeared.</p>
<p>The Dragon King must have been manipulating the antidemons in some way.</p>
<p>Frederick’s words further confirmed that.</p>
