</div><h1>Chapter 911</h1><p>Velmeria appeared in the support group, but she was not the only one who was leading the group. </p>
<p>『Is this time, reinforcements? There are quite a few of them coming towards us.』</p>
<p>「Nn. A lot.」</p>
<p> The number of them was well over a hundred. Maybe there were about 300 or 400 people? They were moving in groups, and it was clear to me that they were in charge. However, their identity was soon revealed. I remembered the presence of someone at the front of the group. I remembered the presence of someone at the front of the group.  </p>
<p>「Mea!  We’re here!」</p>
<p>『Yeah!  We’ve got a hundred manpower!』</p>
<p>  Mea came to support us along with the outlaws of the Beastmen Union. The beastmen went out of the cracks in the walls to encamp.  A girl with white hair and black armor smiled in front of us.  </p>
<p>「Fuhahahaha!  I-I-I’m here!」</p>
<p>「W-Miss Hilt... You don’t mind being noticed?」</p>
<p>「It matters! Rather than such trivial things, you should just focus on defense now!」</p>
<p>「Haa!」</p>
<p>  It was Zefmate who was waiting for Mea’s side. I guess Zefmate was the one to take care of her side in this town.  Well, even Zefmate was getting stronger enough. It was a reassuring force.  </p>
<p>「This is your first time talking to the saintess, you know?  I’m late!  Sorry!As expected, there was a disturbance from the Dragon King.  </p>
<p>「Aah― , that!  I don’t know what’s going on!」</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>「Miss Hilt... I know...」</p>
<p>  That must be a hunch.  It reminded me of Mea from when we first met Fran. Maybe, my friend’s friend wanted to say something like that, but he was too embarrassed to say it clearly.  If Quina was here, I would use my poison tongue to relieve Mea’s tension and push her back. Zefmate, I’m not done yet!  </p>
<p>「I’m Mea, and I’m Fran’s friend! Is that so too, you know?」</p>
<p>「I would be happy if you thought I was her friend...」</p>
<p>「What the hell is it, if I fight together, I will become her friend!?  Fran also thinks so. Somehow, even I would be happy!  </p>
<p>「Kuh.  I’ll be glad to see you fighting alongside me.」</p>
<p> It’s Mea’s gotta keep her cool no matter her location, yet she still kept her surroundings brighter.  A small smile appeared on Sophie’s face, overwriting her depressed face from the shit out of the holy knight and dragonkin.  </p>
<p>「Fuhahaha!  Leave it to me!」</p>
<p>  Mea also smiled proudly and looked motivated. </p>
<p>「Zefmate, let’s go!」</p>
<p>「Yes!」</p>
<p>  Mea pulled out her Dragon Sword Lind and jumped in a straight line from the wall towards the antidemons below her. Flames flashed from behind, making it look as if she had acquired the wings of flames.  It looked cool, but there was no ton of demonstration what she had done.  To my surprise, she activated four Verniers at the same time.  How could she use a Vernier that was already difficult to control at the same time so skillfully...? ...... Mea seemed to have done a lot of training.  With her flame tail clad, Mea pushed through the sky at a tremendous speed and thrust into the antidemon horde. The huge explosion blew the antidemons away, as if it had rained down a meteorite.  The impact was so powerful that even we, the audience, were worried.  It wasn’t a suicide bomb, right? But soon after, a cat beastman girl in a white flame appeared from the crater.  There wasn’t even a trace of dust.  How could she stay unharmed in that situation? Maybe it was because of her barrier or flame immunity......  </p>
<p>「Mea!」</p>
<p>「Fuhaha!  Sorry Fran!」</p>
<p>  As expected of Fran.  Unlike me, she didn’t have any doubts about Mea’s safety. She cheerfully shouted without any confusion.  </p>
<p>「Now that I’ve come, the victory is guaranteed!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  Thank you very much. However, I asked her something that had been bothering me a little.  </p>
<p>『Mea, do you have any information on the other gates?』</p>
<p>「I’ll be fine!  After defeating all the leaders of the Beastmen Union, the organization now belonged to me. Now the Bloodfang Brigade captains and their men are leading their way to each gate!」</p>
<p>「Then how safe?」</p>
<p>『Well, the ones in the Bloodfang Brigade are very skilled. </p>
<p>「Then how safe?」</p>
<p>『Well, the Bloodfang Brigade’s men are pretty skilled, so it won’t be a problem if they don’t have many antidemons.』</p>
<p>  It must have taken a while to deploy such a force. </p>
<p>『Mea, do you know anything about the other organizations?』</p>
<p>「The adventurers have already started fighting at each gate, so we don’t know the dragonkin and towers!」</p>
<p>「Of the Dragon King Syndicate, our friends are already at the gates. The three claws are scattered at the gate too.」</p>
<p>  They must have heard Mea’s words.  Velmeria came down close to them and told us the rest. Of course, she was fighting with us. This battlefield was right next to the east gate, so it could be said to also be a defense for the east gate.  That meant that each gate was well guarded. That relieved me of one of my worries.  </p>
<p>「I see! Then we’ll be able to fight without any worries!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  Then, the white and black girls started fighting side by side.  I guess they were on the same page. They were in perfect coordination without any prior arrangements. </p>
<p>「You’ve gotten stronger, Fran!」</p>
<p>「Mea too!」</p>
<p>「Hahaha!  It’s not going to be surprising if you’re only surprised by that much!  In order to catch up with you, I’ve also developed a trump card!」</p>
<p>「Oooh, my trump card! Amazing!」</p>
<p>「Probably!  If one that’s a little more chewy appears, we’ll have a chance to show it to you! So look forward to it!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  Wait just a second. It would be a little hard to go on a strong opponent that needed to use their trump card...Looks like they’re having fun in the middle of the battlefield.</p>
