</div><h1>Chapter 921</h1><p>No voice rang out.</p>
<p>This wasn’t just a matter of time.</p>
<p>At the same time, forces welling up from within me that made me wonder if I could control it or not.</p>
<p>《Evil Wolf Sword Fenrir――It has been rejected by Fenrir. Intelligence Sword Cherubim――Negative. I’m not a Cherubim, but Announcer-san. I have already refused. I’ve frozen the name change forcibly――No problem. I have temporarily acquired the skills “King Wolf”, “Fenrir”, “Evil Spirit Rush” and “Intelligence”. Mixed Slayer has changed to “Golden Devourer”. Change the ability of Golden Devourer――Part of the Golden Devourer’s territory has been broken――Change to the skill “Golden Devourer」</p>
<p>Wh-what’s going on? I’ve mastered a lot of skills!</p>
<p>But I couldn’t help but be happy. I could feel the evil spirits increasing too. Could this be bad?</p>
<p>『Master, this is a little bad! Can you get it?』</p>
<p>『Fenrir huh!?』</p>
<p>Oh, we could talk!</p>
<p>『What’s going on since before! What the hell is the King Wolf Sword, Fenrir?』</p>
<p>『Thanks to the power of the Oracle, everything in Master was also going strong. The residues of the Fanatics, Overgrowth’s factor... And me too!』</p>
<p>『I-I see? But what did you mean by discarding or rejecting the naming? The Evil Wolf Sword seems a little scary, but I don’t know if it temporarily makes you stronger, right? If I had been here, you wouldn’t have to be controlled by the Evil Gods, right?』</p>
<p>『As long as I don’t get controlled by it!』</p>
<p>『So you’re saying that it’s no good?』</p>
<p>『Yeah. Master’s soul, which is close to the person now, cannot withstand the fusion with my soul. If I were to step forward, even temporarily, Master’s soul would be crushed and disappear!』</p>
<p>『Ueh? Seriously?』</p>
<p>Without my knowledge, it was on the verge of extinction!</p>
<p>『Besides. If I go forward, I’ll take the authority of the sword, you know?』</p>
<p>『In other words, the Evil Gods would be on a rampage without me?』</p>
<p>《Exactly. If the individual named Fenrir becomes the main personality of the sword, he will lose his resistance to the Evil God Fragment》</p>
<p>Uwaah, that was certainly terrible. It would completely harm Fran.</p>
<p>《The unnecessary ones will be held back by me and the individual named Fenrir》</p>
<p>『That’s why, Master needs the best』</p>
<p>『So you’re trying to hold back the Evil God Fragment?』</p>
<p>『Yeah』</p>
<p>『No, I can do that?』</p>
<p>『You’ll be fine after all. It’s no exaggeration to say that resistance to Evil Spirits was better than mine and the Gods. And I’ll take care of the other troubles here, Cherubim’s residue――No, just leave it to Announcer-san』</p>
<p>《The individual named Master is able to do this》</p>
<p>So, I have to control and hold back the pieces of the Evil God that are trying to push forward too hard.</p>
<p>In fact, I am beginning to feel an Evil Spirit within me. If I were to disappear, I would go on a rampage at once.</p>
<p>『Okay... I’ll do it then!』</p>
<p>Either way, if she couldn’t do that, she would have trouble for Fran. The current Fran would have been able to fight without a weapon, but she would have been disqualified as a partner if she had to act like a fool around here.</p>
<p>Let’s live up to Announcer-san and Fenrir’s expectations!</p>
<p>『Fran』</p>
<p>(Master! Are you okay?)</p>
<p>『I’m sorry. I’ll be useless for a while. I’ll be coming back soon, so please wait』</p>
<p>(Okay! I’ll do my best by myself until Master returns!)</p>
<p>『I leave it to you』</p>
<p>I refused and concentrated my attention inside myself.</p>
<p>The key will be the skills we just acquired. Evil Spirit Rush is a dangerous skill that strengthens evil spirits.</p>
<p>But when combined with Evil Domination, it might be possible to contact the pieces of the Evil God inside me and put them under my control.</p>
<p>I activated both skills at the same time. The effect of the Evil Spirit Rush instantly increased the intensity of the evil within me.</p>
<p>『Guh...!』</p>
<p>《......!》</p>
<p>『Fenrir! Announcer-san! Are you okay!?』</p>
<p>《No problem》</p>
<p>『I’m fine! Don’t worry about me! I care about you, and I’m not a good person to deal with!』</p>
<p>『Okay, I’ll end this as soon as possible!』</p>
<p>I focused more on searching for the piece of the Evil God that should have had an increased presence through the Evil Spirit Rush. Then, I was able to sense a lump of evil energy, as if it had been concentrated in one piece.</p>
<p>It was the deepest level within me, a place covered in black darkness where I couldn’t see anything.</p>
<p>『Oi, Fragment of the Evil God』</p>
<p>『Uwooooh! Eat everything!』</p>
<p>『Yeah, yeah. It’s so noisy. Kinda like you keeping quiet』</p>
<p>『Graaaaaah!』</p>
<p>I ignored my usual “eat everything!” and activated my Evil Domination. Then, I concentrated all of my power on my skill.</p>
<p>No matter how many skills I had, my opponent was still that piece of the Evil God. I couldn’t control it so easily. Even when I knew that my control would not work on me, I was still resisting it.</p>
<p>But her power did not work on me, and my skill definitely put her power under her control. My victory was unwavering.</p>
<p>『Haaaah!』</p>
<p>I knew it was powerful, but to think it was a failed divine sword!</p>
<p>I knew it was powerful, but to think it was a failed divine sword!</p>
<p>Alright, the pieces of the Evil Gods were terrified. They got quieter when they shouted before, and were surprisingly weak to blow, or rather, weak to push.</p>
<p>Then I concentrated all my strength and succeeded in blocking the Evil God Fragment at once. I couldn’t have controlled the fragment itself, but I must have been able to reach a state close to sealing it.</p>
<p>Moreover, there was an unexpected byproduct. To my surprise, it made it possible for me to control the Evil Spirits within me. I guess it was because I was strengthened by the Oracle.</p>
<p>Right now, I can control my Evil Spirits with the same feeling as magic power. Well, I don’t think I would fight with evil spirits in the front though, since I have the eyes of others.</p>
<p>However, it would be possible to use this Evil Spirit instead of magic power for the use of skills. In other words, the amount of magic power has doubled.</p>
<p>『Fine. I’ve done it.』</p>
<p>『You saved us. We’ll take care of the rest inside.』</p>
<p>《The individual named Master will support the individual named Fran》</p>
<p>『Yeah, I’m on it!』</p>
