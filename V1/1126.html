</div><h1>Chapter 1126</h1><p>「A divine artifact! This divine artifact is befitting of us!」</p>
<p>So that’s why they call it a “Divine Equipment”! Didn’t Mareficents and the others have anything nasty? Don’t let the examiner confuse the exam!</p>
<p>But that didn’t give us a reason to target Fran.</p>
<p>(That guy is, Master.)</p>
<p>『Eh? Me?』</p>
<p>(Nn. I’m sure of it.)</p>
<p>So, in other words, I was the Divine Attribute?</p>
<p>「Nn. But I can’t borrow the power of the tree blacksmith」</p>
<p>「Little girl! Bring that Divine Attribute! Bring the sword to me! I can feel the power of the Evil God! This sword is truly the Divine Attribute of the Evil God!」</p>
<p>The undead were really aiming at me. It seems he had sniffed the piece of the Evil God sealed inside me.</p>
<p>Sorry Fran and everyone! It was my fault that they attacked us!</p>
<p>「......You want me to take the sword?」</p>
<p>「That’s right! For a little girl like you, such an artifact is unsuitable! Bring it to us!」</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>His expression dropped from Fran’s face. It wasn’t just me, the brave soldiers must have understood that this was a sign of Fran’s explosion.</p>
<p>And then, a tremendous amount of killing intent came scattered around me.</p>
<p>Not only the brazen soldiers who had braced themselves, but even the ghouls, who should have had little fear of death, screamed and backed away. They must have imagined themselves being brutally slashed down.</p>
<p>That’s just how intense and vicious Fran’s killing intent was. But even at this rate, she must have thought about her comrades slightly and was not serious.</p>
<p>「Malfiscent, clean up the surroundings with everyone.」</p>
<p>「Understood」</p>
<p>Mareficent and Persona nodded violently as if they were in sync.</p>
<p>「I’ll――I’ll crush this guy」</p>
<p>The moment Fran muttered these words, more killing intent than ever before was swung at the ghouls. If it had been against these brave soldiers, my heart would have stopped beatings.</p>
<p>The commander, ghoul, seemed to have understood Fran’s strength. He seemed to have little ability to search for her opponent’s strength, but he seemed to understand her when she was hit with this much killing intent and intimidation.</p>
<p>However, I was only a moment under pressure. He immediately leapt over to Fran with a crazy scream.</p>
<p>「Urgaaaaah! Bring it on! Urgaaah!」</p>
<p>「I won’t give it to you!」</p>
<p>Fran and the commander ghoul collided.</p>
<p>The ghoul’s attack was a slash with a long claw, but it was harder than I had imagined. After all, it could strike me head-on. It snapped at me in a few slashes, but new claws were soon starting to grow.</p>
<p>It had less magic power, but no damage. Claws seemed to be regenerating at all costs.</p>
<p>However, Fran was by far the better at swordsmanship. All of Ghoul’s claws were repelled and handled. Her physical abilities exceeded Fran’s, but that was even until Fran used Brilliant Lightning Rush.</p>
<p>My opponent was far superior in strength, but it was nothing for me if I got a hit. I couldn’t get behind Fran at all, since she outmatched her in speed and sword strength.</p>
<p>「Nugaa!」</p>
<p>Just like her trump card, the ghoul sprayed poison on the surrounding area. It was a terrifying poison that inflicted magic poison on anyone who touched it and even just melted its flesh. It was a vicious thing that took the lives of all living beings at the mere touch of it. If it was spilt in a water source or a granary area, the country would seriously lose its power.</p>
<p>But it didn’t work on Fran. The skills of High Abnormal Condition Resistance, Healing Magic, Purification Magic, Poison Absorption, etc.</p>
<p>The poison smoke from the slaughter, which caused death for all of us, had no more effect than just a blindfold. He seemed to have been worried about his comrades for a moment, but that didn’t seem to be a problem. Mareficent’s wide-area wards were just too good. It reminded me of Seliadot’s track record. The ward covering each and every one of our comrades-in-arms had completely nullified the poison. Fran, who was relieved to see them, jumped towards the ghouls.</p>
<p>Fran dodged all the claws of the ghouls and pierced through the poisonous smoke, striking her reddish-black rotting body with a slash.</p>
<p>「Ugh――!」</p>
<p>The sword exploded, sending him flying in the head without even screaming. And at the same time, the slash went as fast as he could, cutting through his limbs and torso.</p>
<p>Furthermore, black lightning raged wildly inside his body, and smoke billowed from his entire body. Some of it was even charred. Under normal circumstances, he was like a battle ant.</p>
<p>However, this ghoul was not ordinary. It was originally a top-level race with high regenerative power, and it was also enhanced by Evil Spirits.</p>
<p>Before he was blown away and fell to the ground, he had regenerated not only his limbs but even his head, and had returned to his perfect body. He landed as if nothing had happened and jumped at us again.</p>
<p>With her physical and regenerative abilities, she was the type that focused on pushing her opponent forward. Moreover, her claws had poisons that originally caused multiple status abnormalities, and she even had death poison magic.</p>
<p>This was a tactic that allowed him to have an advantage at once as long as he could snatch us at it.</p>
<p>Well, with all that poison and evil spirit, there was a chance that we could beat even a superior opponent. Even an A-ranked adventurer might be able to get poison injected with the skill nullified by the evil spirit.</p>
<p>But it was meaningless to Fran though.</p>
<p>「Guuuh! Why doesn’t it work! And my power is being whittled down......! Is that the power of my divine weapon!?」</p>
<p>Well, you’re right. To be more precise, it was the effect of the Evil Crusher skill I had. It was not enough to completely inhibit regeneration, but every time Fran’s slash hit, the Evil Spirit of the ghouls was whittled down, and the speed of regeneration slowed down.</p>
<p>Evil and healing. We had the power of a natural enemy to the ghouls, who were terrifying enough to destroy an entire country. Our compatibility with them was way too bad.</p>
<p>Here, I decided to try something I had been thinking about for a while.</p>
<p>『Evil Conquest, activate!』</p>
<p>Until now, this skill had only been used to protect Fran from Evil Spirits and control the pieces of the Evil God sealed inside me. But what if I could use it directly against an evil spirited opponent?</p>
<p>I wondered if I could absorb their power or, if I could, manipulate their behavior.</p>
<p>That’s what I thought when I used the skill, but it seemed to work surprisingly well.</p>
<p>「Guh! T-This is!」</p>
<p>The movements of the ghouls visibly slowed down. This was not an evil person, but an undead with only evil energy, but at this rate, it would be effective against evil. It seemed to be useful as a trump card against evil.</p>
<p>『This is the perfect opportunity for us to kill your Evil Spirits! Slayer, slayer, and slayer!』</p>
<p>「Nn! Haaa!」</p>
<p>「Shiiiit!」</p>
