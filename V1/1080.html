</div><h1>Chapter 1080</h1><p>We ran out of the town of lockers and headed back to Barbra with a forceful march. Satya seemed to have accompanied us, but as expected, she didn’t force us to go.</p>
<p>She must have understood that she couldn’t do anything else in the Kranzel Kingdom anymore. It was, in a sense, a hostage somewhere. If Satya did something strange, the Kranzel Kingdom and the Philias Kingdom might get along.</p>
<p>Guild master also asked us to stay if we could.</p>
<p>Besides, I’d like to ask him to keep an eye on Dirk. He won’t know what’s going on against someone of that level, and there’s a possibility that Raidos will send an assassin to silence him.</p>
<p>『It’s the Raydoss army! We made it just in time!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>The Raydoss fleet, including the water dragonkin, was about to show up off the coast of Barbra. It was still small like a beanbag now, but we should reach Barbra in less than an hour.</p>
<p>I checked from above, I could see two water dragonkin lined up. However, Seedrun’s ships were not there. Apparently, all of them were battle ships of the Raidos Kingdom, except for the water dragonkin.</p>
<p>As we got closer, I could see that strong magic power had covered the entire area. There was definitely a barrier. If things didn’t work out that way, the two ships might be working together to put up barriers to protect themselves more powerfully.</p>
<p>But she already knew how to fight to destroy the water dragonkin.</p>
<p>『First of all――』</p>
<p>(Master, wait!)</p>
<p>『What’s wrong?』</p>
<p>(Mal is willing to leave.)</p>
<p>『What?』</p>
<p>Immediately after Fran stopped me, a translucent woman appeared in front of me. She must have looked like Marl before she went out of control.</p>
<p>『Ooh! I can feel its presence!』</p>
<p>(Really?)</p>
<p>『Yeah! My spirit detection is working!』</p>
<p>I possess the skill “Spirit Detection”, but this has rarely done any work. I guess it was around the time I broke the connection between Weena and Rhyn?</p>
<p>Fran didn’t have any skills to detect the presence of spirits, while I couldn’t detect the presence of spirits even with those skills.</p>
<p>This may be the reason why they say that when it comes to communicating with spirits, compatibility with spirits was not the key. I was not a good match for spirits, and Fran was a favorite of them.</p>
<p>However, I wondered if Marl had approved of me, but this time I was able to sense his presence a little.</p>
<p>Uwaah, what a spirit was like!</p>
<p>「......!」</p>
<p>She didn’t utter a voice and moved her hand wide. It looked as if she was sending some kind of signal to someone...</p>
<p>I could feel a small hint of magic power moving in the air. It wasn’t that it was aggressive, but was it Marl doing it?</p>
<p>As I watched over Maar with Fran, something strange immediately occurred. To my surprise, the strong magic that had covered the area around the water dragonkin had disappeared.</p>
<p>I activated some weak wind magic that I couldn’t even notice, and was able to touch the hull without being interrupted.</p>
<p>The ward had clearly disappeared.</p>
<p>『Did Marl do it?』</p>
<p>「I need you to save onee-chan」</p>
<p>『Isn’t Marl’s big sister the Princess!? Are she on this water dragonkin too?』</p>
<p>「Nn. He’s not like Marl, he’s just been enslaved」</p>
<p>The translucent Marl bowed lightly to us and disappeared.</p>
<p>『Does Marl know where the princess are?』</p>
<p>「I understand」</p>
<p>『Then let’s rescue the princesses first and then destroy the fleet in droves.』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Fran and Urushi descended onto the water dragonkin while concealing their presence.</p>
<p>It would be difficult to find the current Fran if she was not a person with detection skills or a very high-level magic tool.</p>
<p>Well, in the case of the water dragonkin, which was the country’s best force, there was a possibility that it had that level of security.</p>
<p>With all her skills and magic at full power, she ran across the deck of the water dragonkin, hiding all her appearance, presence, and magic power. We entered the ship without anyone being spotted, and Fran continued to walk through the complicated interior without lying.</p>
<p>『Fran, do you know how?』</p>
<p>(Mal will tell me about it)</p>
<p>『I see』</p>
<p>Fran and Marl seemed to be able to communicate better than I thought. In the end, we arrived at our destination without meeting anyone.</p>
<p>Since the water dragonkin could move even with a small number of people, there were only a few crew members and almost no patrolling crew members.</p>
<p>Fran slowly opened the door and stepped inside. There, she found a beautiful woman with silver hair and brown skin lying on the bed. No, she seemed to be conscious, just lying on the bed.</p>
<p>After I blocked out the sound with wind magic, Fran spoke to the woman.</p>
<p>「Hey.」</p>
<p>「!! Who is she?」</p>
<p>「I’m Fran. I’m an adventurer. Is that you, oneesama of Marl?」</p>
<p>「Mal! That girl! Is she safe!?」</p>
<p>She must be Marl’s big sister. In other words, she was the Princess of the Sea Kingdom of Sydran. Her gestures were refined, and she certainly looked like a princess, huh?</p>
<p>「Escaping is our first priority right now. We were asked by Marl to help us」</p>
<p>「You’re right... Yes. I’m Selimea, and I’m Mar’s sister. However, I can’t leave the water dragonkin because of this」</p>
<p>Selymea muttered sadly as she touched the collar on her neck. The slave collar must be limiting her movements.</p>
<p>「It’s meaningless if I’ve lost consciousness, but that doesn’t mean I can’t escape......」</p>
<p>「Then, I should just let him faint?」</p>
<p>「......But that means they’ll carry me and run away, right?」</p>
<p>「Nn. No problem, Urushi.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>「Kya!」</p>
<p>Selymea shouted at Urushi, who suddenly appeared from the shadows. But it wasn’t a scream of fear. She had read the air and appeared in a puppy-type form.</p>
<p>Selymea managed to get used to Urushi’s existence, and Urushi changed to the size of a large dog.</p>
<p>「Well, that’s great」</p>
<p>「Nn. Urushi can be much bigger. I can carry Selimea too.」</p>
<p>Or rather, she would suck me, but I wouldn’t tell her that. It would be troublesome if Selymea tried to hold me back.</p>
<p>「Thank you very much for your cooperation.」</p>
<p>「......You believe me?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. I’m gonna have a look at people. Besides, I feel like Marl was telling me to believe you」</p>
<p>「I think it’s time for her to get some real combat soon」</p>
<p>「Yes」</p>
<p>After that, we invaded the other ship and succeeded in successfully rescuing Princess Miriam, our other sister. It took longer to earn her more trust than Princess Selymea though. Besides, this one didn’t look like much of a princess. In fact, she looked more suitable as an adventurer.</p>
<p>Race: Ragnarok Wolf; Demon Wolf; Magic Beast</p>
<p>After the disappearance of the barrier, she must have tried to check something out with the princess. Then she realized that there was no sign of her. Too late!</p>
<p>「Urushi, keep protecting the two like this」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>「We’ll help the water dragons and destroy the fleet」</p>
<p>『Got it!』</p>
