</div><h1>Chapter 917</h1><p>We got on Urushi’s back and ran through Sendia. His leg strength was even greater than we had imagined, climbing up the walls of the buildings vertically to reach the closest path. But the results were poor. Naturally, we headed for the tower. That’s where we tried to ask the soldiers for help...... But most of the soldiers were already on their way to the gates. Moreover, Seliadot was nowhere to be found. Moreover, Seliadot was nowhere to be seen.  The commander in charge of the unit looked at me and turned his face downwards.  He clearly thought I was a hindrance.  No matter how much we asked him, he wouldn’t allow us to send troops.  He’ll protect this tower?  Don’t you trust anyone else? What are they saying when the town is about to be destroyed?  They may appeal directly to the soldiers still in the tower, but they do not move because they were ordered by the commander. They probably only left their men behind in the tower.  I wondered what they were doing, but they were evacuating a variety of valuables. Money, jewelry, medicine, and other supplies were being carried out in evacuation item bags.  Money?  How stupid.  In this critical situation, we couldn’t trust them anymore.  At the very least, we could not save the patients anymore. I guess most of the patients were still missing.  Seems like Seliadot had ordered us to evacuate.  I decided to give up on the support from the tower and head elsewhere.  Mea-san and Velmeria-san from the Beastmen Union and the Dragon King Syndicate must have been working together.  Then, the next step would be to get to the Adventurers Guild. That’s what I thought, but......  There were almost no people in the guild. It seems that many adventurers have already moved to the guards of the gate.  Moreover, many antidemons came rushing over to them, and they couldn’t afford to reduce their forces. They also said that the remaining adventurers could not be reduced to protect the guild.  If the city was destroyed, there wouldn’t be any connection to the organization......  But what about here too?  When they appealed further that they needed troops, a man named the submaster yelled at them.  He seemed to be planning to escape from the city. He apparently left adventurers behind as his escort.  I couldn’t believe they were trying to escape on their own at a time like this......  But the Adventurers Guild couldn’t be trusted either. That’s why I thought they would cooperate with a small organization......  </p>
<p>「Saintess-san.  Sorry, but it’s not possible. I don’t have enough people here.」</p>
<p>「I know it’s gonna be tough!  But it’s a crisis in this town!」</p>
<p>「We’ll make sure to put forward the forces we allocate to!」</p>
<p>「That’s not gonna happen as usual! </p>
<p>「We won’t reduce the number of guards here.  If the other groups promise to deploy their forces, we should obey too.」</p>
<p>  They didn’t trust the other organizations, and they were wary of fire thieves.  No matter where we went, they responded in the same way. Some of them were paying in front of the gate.  I guess no organization wants to reduce their forces more than necessary.  On the contrary, some of them were even preparing to escape. Some of them promised to send people, but there were really only a few of them.  We went to small organizations like that, but in the end, we didn’t achieve great results. We couldn’t waste any more time.  </p>
<p>「... Why?  You don’t want to protect this city?」</p>
<p>「Woof」</p>
<p>「Comfort?」</p>
<p>「Woof」</p>
<p>  Urushi licked his cheeks.  I could see that his beatings were soothing as he stood next to us. Besides, Urushi, who had left his master Fran, must be in a hurry. I couldn’t just stop him here.  But things suddenly changed here. With a tremendous crash, the eastern wall was destroyed.  Is Fran and Urushi safe? Even if they were safe, that wouldn’t be enough to prevent the antidemons from entering the city.  </p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Y-you’re right.  You’d better not give up.」</p>
<p>  We absolutely needed help. That’s why we decided to go around more organizations, but we failed to get reinforcements’ promises.  Seeing the destroyed wall, everyone started thinking about running away. Some of them made fun of me for fighting.  </p>
<p>「... I’m pitiful!」</p>
<p>  When I walked out of the building, I couldn’t help but cry.  Some people thought they would run away even when the time came, and some have to dodge it. </p>
<p>「Umm, Saintess-sama...? Are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Eh?」</p>
<p> It was a few men who approached me.  I guess they were ordinary people who lived in this city. And they were carrying a large bag of cloth on their backs.  They seemed to be on the way to escape from the city.  Seeing them, I cried even more. I thought that the people living in the city would no longer be able to escape. Fran was risking their lives to protect the city.  But then, I suddenly saw a spear on the men’s back. Everyone in this city had a weapon on their backs.  The reason they did so was to counter the criminals.  Some of them didn’t protect each other, even if they made a promise that they wouldn’t touch the civilians. Besides, many of them inherited it from their ancestors.  After thinking about it that far, I suddenly thought that they wouldn’t be able to fight.Under normal circumstances, this would be impossible.  I didn’t even think that way in the first place. But after being cornered, I couldn’t help but open my mouth.  </p>
<p>「There are people fighting to protect this city」</p>
<p>「Eh?  Haaah?」</p>
<p>「But if we don’t do something, this city might collapse. Can you fight alongside us?」</p>
<p>「Eh?  No, no, it’s impossible!」</p>
<p>「That’s right. We’ve never even experienced actual combat before!」</p>
<p>「We’ll leave it to you!」</p>
<p>「No, no, it’s impossible!」</p>
<p>「Yes!」</p>
<p>「And those who are fighting with us might be annihilated too!」</p>
<p>  Of course, no matter how much I asked them, the men only excused themselves. It was only natural.  They had no power or preparation to fight. They were on the defensive side.  </p>
<p>「W-We can generally leave it to those who want to fight!  We didn’t order them to fight! It’s not like we ordered them to know!」</p>
<p>「Y-you’re right!  It’s their job! You’re the ones who have to take care of it!」</p>
<p>「You’re the ones dying, you have to take care of it!」</p>
<p>「I don’t want to beg for my favor!」</p>
<p>  So, these are the people of this city...... To save these people, Fran and Urushi...  Despair. All I could say is, it’s already impossible.  This city will be destroyed.  If that’s the case, I’ll go at least to save Fran and Urushi and help them escape.  But that was just when I thought about it.  </p>
<p>「What nonsense are you talking about!? This inn is the sixth inn!」</p>
<p>「Bugheh! B-Mom!」</p>
<p>「You’re making rotting excuses towards the saintess......!  Didn’t you know more about the soldiers? I always ask them to protect him, and what’s his reason for that!」</p>
<p>「I-I mean...」</p>
<p>「Silence!  Most of them left me behind and were trying to escape on their own, right? This scumbag!」</p>
<p>「Ghaah!」</p>
<p>  Umm, is this old lady really this man’s wife? I thought she had suddenly started a argument, but she beat the man up and shut him up.  It seemed that the wives of the other men were also there, and their faces were beaten up and crushed.  I don’t want to heal them though. </p>
<p>「Umm, who are you?」</p>
<p>「I’m sorry, Saintess-sama! The ladies bowed their heads one after another. And behind them, there were signs of many people running toward them.  The sounds of their footsteps could be heard in thousands. The crowds of people filling the main street came towards us with brave expressions on their faces.  And with the weapons of their own volition. </p>
<p>「You need to forget what these self-absorbed bokenas said.」</p>
<p>「This is only a small part of you!」</p>
<p>「Yes.  I thought it was useless, but I didn’t expect it to be this useful... We’ll be separated when we get back!」</p>
<p>「We’re here too! Rather, let’s just take them with us and throw them out onto the front lines!」</p>
<p>  She looked so reliable.  </p>
<p>「We’re working for this city!  How can we let people fight and let them escape by themselves?! We’ll fight just in case!」</p>
<p>「That’s right!  Everyone feels the same way! Don’t abandon those who are fighting you!」</p>
<p>「Saintess-sama, let’s go with them!</p>
<p>「Yes...</p>
<p>「Yes... Yes!」</p>
