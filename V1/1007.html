</div><h1>Chapter 1007</h1><p>Fran’s slash cleaves Meritte’s torso.</p>
<p>「Kyaa!」</p>
<p>A bitter scream then leaked out from Meritte’s mouth. Unlike before, she seemed to be feeling pain. I didn’t know much about the Divine Attribute yet, but I was sure that she had deactivated the Pain Nullification skill.</p>
<p>And it was not only the pain that he had inflicted on her. Magic power and Evil Spirits were overflowing from the wound that had been deeply slashed.</p>
<p>There was no blood or mana in the area just now, but the divine attribute had apparently inflicted significant damage to the antidemons’ bodies.</p>
<p>And Fran’s attacks did not end there.</p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>She returned the swung tip of her sword and slashed away at Meritte’s left arm. Even the body of a strong defending antidemon could be slashed without pain as long as she had the offensive power of the Sword God Transformation.</p>
<p>With overwhelming skill and the dense divine attribute that covered the blade, this was the work of the Sword God.</p>
<p>「Suddenly, what the......!」</p>
<p>「I won’t let you go」</p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>For the first time, Meritte looked impatient as Fran suddenly became stronger during the battle. She was trying to escape somehow, but there was no way she could escape from Fran now.</p>
<p>Fran, on the other hand, had a confused look that only I could understand. But the same went for me.</p>
<p>(My body, is it light?)</p>
<p>『Yeah, me too』</p>
<p>It was the same feeling of loss that I always felt when I used Sword God Transformation.</p>
<p>It’s not just about reducing my durability value. I feel something wear and tear, something that could wear me out from a deeper level. That was less this time.</p>
<p>It’s not that there was no, but it was less than half as usual.</p>
<p>Fran also seemed to feel less of a backlash.</p>
<p>I wonder if this was the result of her being able to handle the Divine Attributes on her own with the blessings of the Beast and Insect Gods?</p>
<p>Until now, I’d been trying to control the Divine Attribute somehow. However, it seemed that Fran herself had to get the Divine Attribute to make full use of the Sword God Transformation. That’s why she shouldn’t be able to handle it well.</p>
<p>And it wasn’t just the backlash and exhaustion that showed that Fran was able to make full use of this power.</p>
<p>Rather than an optimized battle with Sword God Transformation, Fran was moving her body at will.</p>
<p>Fran, who was able to understand her ideal movement instead of doing it on her own, chose to act on her own from several options. That was clearly what it looked like.</p>
<p>I feel like we can cut her now. I guess it’s the same for Fran.</p>
<p>I suddenly shot a slash at the place I told her to go to. At first glance, it looked as if I wasted no time slashing at an empty sky.</p>
<p>But that was not the case.</p>
<p>What Fran was aiming for was an evil thread. It was an invisible string that extended from a cross-shaped magic sword to an antidemon in a fierce battle with Isario.</p>
<p>Throughout the previous fights, I’ve often overlapped with those threads. But that didn’t turn out to be the case. Well, otherwise, I wouldn’t have been able to fight with them anymore.</p>
<p>But now we could cut it. Both Fran and I were convinced of that.</p>
<p>As a result of my unconscious combination of Fran’s Sword God Transformation and my Evil Spirit Control――.</p>
<p>「It’s gone.」</p>
<p>「W-Why......!?」</p>
<p>The evil threads were cut off and disappeared. At the same time, there were visible changes in the movements of the red-golden antidemons. Suddenly, their movements became dull.</p>
<p>I would have been lucky if they had lost control of it and killed each other, but that was not enough.</p>
<p>Seeing the antidemon that was blown away by Isario, Merritte shouted.</p>
<p>「Just a little more, huh!?」</p>
<p>They must have applied some kind of power through the evil threads. Obviously, the power released by the antidemons had weakened. I’m sure they were still strong, but it was no longer enough to beat them.</p>
<p>Considering the danger of the red-golden antidemons, Merit showed signs of heading for power.</p>
<p>Apparently, she didn’t want to get rid of that antidemon. Maybe she had something to do with her plan?</p>
<p>「I won’t let you」</p>
<p>「Geh!」</p>
<p>Fran attacked Meritte, who was flustered and exposed an opening. She must have remembered that she couldn’t just ignore her when her back was slashed.</p>
<p>But, well, I don’t know how long I’d be able to keep up with this.</p>
<p>This low cost also means that she can use the Sword God Transformation longer. Fran still maintained her Sword God Transformation.</p>
<p>Arms, legs, and torso. One after another, tears were drilled through and regenerated from the corners. Resistance to these divine attributes is just like that of high-level antidemons.</p>
<p>However, even though his wounds were healed, the magic power he had used to regenerate them was steadily gone. Obviously, the power that Meritte released was beginning to weaken.</p>
<p>And it’s not only because of our improved movement that Meritte is in a fight against.</p>
<p>He seems to have become inversely proportional to Fran, who was performing well. Maybe he took some damage and slowed down his movements. But that’s not all.</p>
<p>He moved strangely in terms of defense, taking our attacks at an unnatural time. He seemed to be protecting the cross-shaped magic sword.</p>
<p>She forced herself to evade in a situation where she was aiming for a parry with her sword at the start of the battle. Because of this, her rhythm went crazy and she was even taking advantage of Fran’s attacks.</p>
<p>He’ll probably still be able to fight if he calms down and recovers, but Meritte is beginning to get impatient as time goes by. What is in Meritte’s eyes is a red-golden antidemon that Isario is toyed with.</p>
<p>Isario seemed to have regained some composure, and was clearly receiving more and more counters. His body was red-hot, which was probably the work of a high-heated field that Isario was good at. The balance of battles was tilted to Isario at once.</p>
<p>「Move! You little girl!」</p>
<p>Without answering Meritte’s half-crazed words, Fran readied me in her right eye. Then, she uttered a word filled with power.</p>
<p>「Black Lightning God’s Claw!」</p>
