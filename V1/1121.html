</div><h1>Chapter 1121</h1><p>The valiant soldiers shivered as they saw Fran slowly raise her head after a dozen seconds of silence.</p>
<p>She must be terrified of what Fran, who seemed to be angry, would do. In the midst of all this, Fran first went to the storage of the carriage.</p>
<p>I unsheathed all the horses and put the cargo on. As for the horses, I handed all the bridles to Mareficent.</p>
<p>「You can ride on horses, take the rest of the horses with you」</p>
<p>「Eh? I’m getting more tired from riding horses though」</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>With Mareficent, Persona nodded at her too. But Fran forced her to push the bridle.</p>
<p>「She said she was going to do chores.」</p>
<p>「Is this for chores?」</p>
<p>「Nn, chores」</p>
<p>「Sigh. I guess it can’t be helped.」</p>
<p>After confirming that Mareficent nodded reluctantly, Fran turned to the valiant soldiers.</p>
<p>「If I take you guys here, they’ll get in trouble.」</p>
<p>「Huh? Umm, what do you mean――?」</p>
<p>「They don’t listen to what bothers them, and they steal food and are slow to walk around. Even if I take them to the front line, they’re just a hindrance to everyone」</p>
<p>The warriors made a commotion at Fran’s straight words. However, no one seemed to have objected to them. There was a disturbing presence emanating from Fran, as if she had remembered the anger she had for these guys as she spoke.</p>
<p>Because of this, he probably thought that if he said bad things to them, they would be in the same condition as those who were made to show up. He looked frustrated, but still silent.</p>
<p>In a heavy atmosphere, Fran walked slowly in front of the stepfathers and talked about the future.</p>
<p>「Maybe I should just throw them away here so as not to get in my way.」</p>
<p>「「「!」」」</p>
<p>It was not because of the anger that the warriors felt on their faces, but because of their fear. I guess it also meant that the words “I’ll throw them away here” meant that the adventurers would slash them away and bury them.</p>
<p>Well, it was no wonder she misunderstood Fran’s anger.</p>
<p>「But even these people might be useful if they can be regenerated」</p>
<p>「Re-regeneration!?」</p>
<p>「Nn. So――Running.」</p>
<p>「Huh?」</p>
<p>「First, I train myself to form a line and run. I thought I’d beat them all up here to tell them what I had to say, but I wouldn’t be able to make it in time. So, I decided to train while running. First of all, train myself to be able to run without breaking the line」</p>
<p>Immediately after Fran said that, the stepfathers formed up incredibly quickly and without skirmishing. They lined up not in the distorted line as before, but in a clean line like a trained soldier.</p>
<p>I think we can do it if we do that.</p>
<p>「Let’s keep running at the same speed and not break our line」</p>
<p>「A-Can I ask a question?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「I-How long should I run?」</p>
<p>「Does she just say I’m fine?」</p>
<p>「Th-what do you mean after all...?」</p>
<p>The man asked more, but Fran just frowned. After all, Fran didn’t know what was the right way to do it, she just wanted to make it run on her own.</p>
<p>However, Fran’s troubled look also seemed annoyed by the warriors. She immediately swallowed her complaints and began to run.</p>
<p>And that was when Fran’s Bootcamp began. They were led by Mareficent on a horse, with the valiant soldiers following behind them, and Fran keeping a watch on them from the end.</p>
<p>That’s why we were serious at first...... Even if we were highly capable, we would get tired if we ran for a long time.</p>
<p>In the first place, their strength was also different. Some of the weaker men were gradually disrupting their formation.</p>
<p>But Fran didn’t want to let him go. She sent Stamina Heal flying and kept running for a long time. However, she didn’t shout at anyone who didn’t have enough strength.</p>
<p>What Fran wouldn’t allow was people who would fall apart or do whatever they wanted. If those people disturbed their formation even a little, my spells flew mercilessly.</p>
<p>Well, his goal was not to let him get a direct hit, but to tell her that he was a little off by letting him snatch it.</p>
<p>However, these problem children were not even treated by the guild in the first place. When they misunderstood that Fran had no intention of hitting them with magic, she started to lick them. She ran slower to take a break and purposely fell. Over time, her fear of Fran must have faded.</p>
<p>As Fran was just trying to drive them away, one of the men shouted loudly.</p>
<p>「Captain!」</p>
<p>「What is it?」</p>
<p>「I’m almost hungry! If things continue like this, I’ll be hungry and dead!」</p>
<p>He smirked as he told us that. Did he think Fran wouldn’t get angry if he wasn’t good at it? But Fran cut through his words in two.</p>
<p>「We won’t have food until she’s able to run properly」</p>
<p>「Huh?」</p>
<p>「I’ve extended the distance I could run again for now」</p>
<p>For Fran, who was a slave, hunger was much more painful than simple violence. In other words, it was only natural for Fran to think about not eating.</p>
<p>「I-I’m not joking!」</p>
<p>「I’m not joking.」</p>
<p>「Shut up! You guys! Feel like you’re going to keep up with this shitty brat’s chase! I’ll crush you down!」</p>
<p>「...Y-Yeah!」</p>
<p>「Nn. Cut it!」</p>
<p>About ten people walked out of the line in response to the man’s voice. All of them seemed to have reached the end of their patience. They were pitiful people after a three-hour run.</p>
<p>Well, if it had been Earth, it would have been on par with a full run. Since Fran had healed her, she should not have been that tired.</p>
<p>The others were still on guard, and did not stop the men. They were secretly expecting Fran to be eliminated if they got any better.</p>
<p>Fran sensed this atmosphere and decided to re-introduce the hierarchical relationship here. It would be a good thing to have all the pus out here.</p>
<p>He stepped forward, clenching his fists.</p>
<p>「I’ll discipline her a little」</p>
<p>She was quite annoyed to see the Brave Soldier-in-law getting in the way even though she wanted to go to the battlefield quickly. Don’t let her off the hook again!</p>
<p>At any rate, it was already decided that the stepfathers would be shattered and obedient. There were also confirmed that the start-up camp would be terrifyingly harsh after this.</p>
