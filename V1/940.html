</div><h1>Chapter 940</h1><p>「When I’m done with my self-introduction, I have a favor to ask Fran」</p>
<p>「A favor?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. Actually, we’re about to be attacked by antidemons in the town of Brutori, east of Nocta.」</p>
<p>「According to those who scouted out, more than 100,000 antidemons could strike Brutori within a few days.」</p>
<p>The antidemons were all coming from the surrounding area, and it was estimated that they would all attack Burtori as soon as there were a few more of them.</p>
<p>「Just like Sendia?」</p>
<p>I wondered if there was another attempt, but this time it was not.</p>
<p>「Unlike Sendia, I think it’s just a natural occurrence. It may not be as big of a threat as the Sanatorium, but Brutori is not a very big town. If things continue like this, it’ll surely disappear」</p>
<p>「Umm, so you wanted us to go there to rescue them. Thanks for the cooperation of the people here.」</p>
<p>What a surprise, we were on a joint request with the Divine Sword wielder. Or rather, do we need Fran? Three Divine Swords would be enough for us.</p>
<p>But apparently, things aren’t going to be that easy. Isario is an adventurer, but he’s a legendary figure on this continent. Even if he makes a move, it won’t be easily credited to the Adventurer’s Guild.</p>
<p>And so, they came up with the idea of accompanying an adventurer that was a little less well known, but was also unable to catch up with the divine sword users.</p>
<p>Isario seemed to have other promising shares besides me, and I guess he wanted to show that they were working hard. I didn’t feel like they were being used properly, but the reward was good. It was not a point reward, but a reward in cash.</p>
<p>What was more, this was a chance to see the battles of the Divine Sword users up close. There was no way Fran would miss that opportunity.</p>
<p>「Okay. I’ll accept that request」</p>
<p>The answer was yes, instantly.</p>
<p>About an hour after Fran accepted the request from the Adventurer’s Guild, she appeared at the east gate of Nocta.</p>
<p>Notes: I got an issue with my editor, he hasn’t done anything on his part for these past ten days, and this is the last chapter he has edited. XD</p>
<p>He refused at first, didn’t he? But there was only one high-ranking adventurer besides Fran, Diggins the bear. And there was no way he could be the commander of the unit aside from Fran.</p>
<p>I wondered if Isario was here, but apparently, he had always promised himself that he would do whatever he wanted solo. Not even the guild could restrain him from doing so.</p>
<p>In the end, Fran had no other suitable person to take over as the commander.</p>
<p>The other adventurers had already heard the rumors about Fran, and barely any people complained. Those who were still complaining were no longer there after Diggins, who was the vice-commander, silenced them.</p>
<p>Fran seemed very motivated too, so she had no choice but to take command of the adventurers.</p>
<p>「Holy Knights.」</p>
<p>『Yeah, it looks pretty decent』</p>
<p>We rescued three adventurers, a knight of the Holy Nation of Silard, a soldier of the Kingdom of Hagane, and a member of the Isario army.</p>
<p>Basically, the two great powers and Isario were the main players, and adventurers were treated as if they were after that. The fact that they fought together was probably important.</p>
<p>The hundred holy knights looked much more ordinary than the others we had seen in Sendia. They had a good formation and no words to say. For better or worse, they were just ordinary knights.</p>
<p>However, his fighting ability was probably lower than those we had seen in Sendia. Perhaps he was one of those people who acted like a knight captain.</p>
<p>However, they clearly looked down on adventurers, so I guess they had similar personalities. There was no way they could work with these guys, and I’m rather grateful for their after-sales treatment.</p>
<p>Unlike the holy knights, the soldiers of the Militant Nation of Hagane seemed to have a hard time working together. They were also lined up neatly without any words. However, there was something fierce within them.</p>
<p>They might be better than the holy knights because they don’t look down on adventurers...... But they certainly feel amazingly good about doing it. The old soldiers here were probably just as good as the adventurers in the way.</p>
<p>「How are you feeling? Young lady」</p>
<p>「Isario, what’s that weird?」</p>
<p>「Suspicious things are terrible. They’re just magic tools, aren’t they?」</p>
<p>The weird thing about Fran was the board on Isario’s back. Well, it was certainly an unfamiliar tool for Fran.</p>
<p>However, I could imagine how it would be used. The shape of the board was familiar to me though. Well, it was from Earth though.</p>
<p>「This is a magical tool for moving around, isn’t it? It floats a little when I ride on it and let magic flow through it. I can’t fly to the sky, but it’s convenient」</p>
<p>「That’s what brings me to my mind」</p>
<p>「Yeah. Uncle hasn’t been able to beat the passing of age lately. He’s gotten tired from just running a little, so I’m counting on him」</p>
<p>I don’t know how true it was, but it was still like a skate item. There were no wheels, so it seemed to be able to rise slightly from the ground. Maybe it was just like a Hover?</p>
<p>Any normal adventurer would eat away at it. They’d say something like “Amazing!” with sparkling eyes.</p>
<p>However, Fran’s reaction was completely different from what Isario had expected.</p>
<p>「Hmm」</p>
<p>「...Is that all?」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>For Fran, who has plenty of methods to fly through the sky, such as telekinetic air rides to jump in the air and Urushi, a slightly floating magic tool is not worth surprising.</p>
<p>Rather, it was written on her face as “That’s all it was”.</p>
<p>「He’s pretty popular with the little ones wherever we go, isn’t he? Let’s ride him on and you’ll be surrounded by him」</p>
<p>Isario must have been willing to surprise Fran, who was expressionless and indifferent. Isario must have been thinking of winning her respect.</p>
<p>An old man was squinting his cheeks as he tried to dodge Isario’s attack. Fran wanted to go get more of a handle on him.</p>
<p>(Master)</p>
<p>『Will you show it to us this time?』</p>
<p>(I can see that Master is better than that board)</p>
<p>『Well, that’s fine』</p>
<p>「Nn. Isario, take a look.」</p>
<p>「Hmm?」</p>
<p>Fran called out to Isario and threw me into the air. Fran jumped up in mid-air, chasing after me as I spun around and flew in the air.</p>
<p>The moment Fran put her feet in mid-air, I activated my telekinesis. The output was kept low, but we moved quickly in front of Isario.</p>
<p>「Oh! That sword flying in the sky!」</p>
<p>「Fufun, the best sword」</p>
<p>Isario’s reaction when he saw Fran running around in the air like a surf on a telekinetic air ride was like that of a child. However, his analysis skills were ridiculous.</p>
<p>「I see, telekinetic ability to fly through the air...」</p>
<p>At first glance, they seemed to have figured out how the telekinetic air ride works.</p>
<p>「The idea of flying with a sword came from somewhere. This is why geniuses are like this」</p>
<p>Isario’s voice was filled with genuine envy.</p>
