</div><h1>Chapter 913</h1><p>Facing the approaching antidemons, Fran and Sophie were discussing what to do next. Well, we had little we could do. Let’s just keep going. We abandoned the city and ran away. The only thing we could do was to gather the forces within the city and fight together. We don’t have time to evacuate everyone in Sendia, and if everyone runs away in large numbers in the first place, the antidemons would follow. In the end, Fran and Sophie, the most well-known among them, went around to various places in search of reinforcements. In the end, Fran and the others stopped the antidemons, and Sophie, the most well-known among them, went around to various places in search of reinforcements.  </p>
<p>「Urushi, put Sophie on your back」</p>
<p>「Woof......」</p>
<p>「Don’t worry.  I’ll endure until reinforcements arrive.  Please do.」</p>
<p>『We can only ask Urushi for help.』</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>  Urushi showed some hesitation for a moment, but he must have understood the importance of bringing in reinforcements. He nodded reluctantly with worried eyes.  </p>
<p>「My partner will fill in the hole between Urushi and Sophie.  Come on, Lind!」</p>
<p>「Quoooourgh!」</p>
<p>  Mea called out the dragon Lind, which resided in her sword. He didn’t summon it from the beginning probably because of the time limit on how long he could summon it.  </p>
<p>「Lind! Long time no see!」</p>
<p>「Quoourgh!」</p>
<p>  Fran stroked Lind, and he barked happily. From his cute appearance, it was hard to believe that he was a superhuman that resided in the Divine Sword.  Yes, the Dragon Sword Lind possessed by Mea was a Divine Sword.  Its original name was the Destroyer Dragon Sword, Lindwilm. It was a Divine Sword that allowed him to summon super-sized dragons. However, Mea hadn’t mastered the use of Lindwilm, and was desperately trying to summon the small flying dragon Lind. However, it was a little bigger than before, huh?  When I saw it before, it looked like a red low-ranked dragon.  I’d call it a fire dragon now. It’s about two large dragons in total, and the scales and horns have increased in presence.  I guess because of Mea’s growth, Lind has also grown. </p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>  Urushi barked as he stared at Lind. As if to respond to this, Lind barked briefly.  It was as if they were saying </p>
<p>「I’m leaving it to you」</p>
<p>  or </p>
<p>「Leave it to me」</p>
<p>. In fact, it was pretty close to that.  </p>
<p>「Let’s go then.」</p>
<p>「Nn.  Sophie, please go ahead.」</p>
<p>「I’ll definitely bring my reinforcements back with me.」</p>
<p> Sophie leaned on Urushi’s back and headed back into town. All that was left was to guard the scene until Sophie sent troops from the various organizations. As we were waiting, we saw a second wave of antidemons approaching us.  </p>
<p>「A horde of beast-types!」</p>
<p>「I can see some too big.」</p>
<p>  Just as Mea and Velmeria said, the new antidemons were mainly beast-types with four legs. I now understand why they moved so fast, even though their scale was several times larger than before.  Fran and I activated our spells against the antidemons rushing in.  With land magic, we created countless spears of rocks. The rock spears grew diagonally toward our opponent, similar to a barrier for horses. unable to avoid the hundreds of spears that suddenly appeared, the leader of the antidemons rushed toward the barrier.  Many of them escaped, but they succeeded in killing their momentum.  With the backs slightly clogged, the density of the leader group increased. Then, everyone’s attacks rained down. Velmeria’s water magic, Mea’s white silver flames, Lind’s crimson flames, Zefmate’s shockwaves, and our thunderbolts. The rain of long-range attacks, which were fired in rapid succession, succeeded in destroying more than 10,000 antidemons in just a few minutes.  Even so, less than 10% of them were able to attract the attention of their enemies. We wanted to keep the pressure as low as possible. Fran and Mea rushed into the antidemons who had pierced through the walls of earth and smoke.  The battle was different from before. Wolf, tiger, bear, and various other beast-types of beast attacked the antidemon without formation. It’s kinda hard to get the right timing, and it’s difficult to avoid all-around attacks that didn’t care about killing each other.  Fran and Mea used the trump cards they had in reserve to defeat the two-sided antidemons. The most raging one was Mea.  The Beast King had used an auto-defense with gold flames.  That ability was too vicious for a disorderly brawl. After all, an enemy could be attacked by flames and defeated on their own.  Because antidemons were attracted to her magic power, they didn’t seem to be wary of Mea. At this rate, the antidemons will continue their self-destruction.  Velmeria was also much stronger than I had imagined.  She finally used Dragon Form, but its entire body was covered with light blue scales, and a huge amount of magic power swirled around her. It seems that she has dramatically increased her defense by covering her with water like armor.  If water armor was added to her armor, she won’t be able to scratch her with comparable attacks. It didn’t seem to defend against the antidemons’ attacks, and it was just countering them with its counter attacks.  The toughest attack was against Zefmate, huh?  Even though it had become stronger, it was not yet in the Rank A class. Gradually, his wounds were increasing.  Should we protect him?  Just as I thought about it, Zefmate shouted.  </p>
<p>「Heavenly leg!」</p>
<p>  It seemed that the blue leopard’s skill was not limited to his leopard legs. Black Heavenly Tigers could use multiple skills, and the rest of the beastmen must have felt the same way.  His skill, the ‘Heavenly leg’, was a skill to strengthen one’s legs. It increased its speed even more than before, and I’m sure it had a maximum speed of Mea or higher.  That seemed to make it possible to stabilize the antidemons for a while. Well, I don’t know if it was safe to say that it was stable when everyone was in a death battle.  But everyone didn’t have time to think about what would happen later.  Or rather, they didn’t have time to think. Fran and the other warriors of the Knights continued to use their death to defeat the antidemons.  That was how they held back the antidemons, but there was a new movement in the antidemon horde.  </p>
<p>「There’s a huge antidemon in the back!」</p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>  Velmeria and Lind in the air emitted a warning.  We didn’t notice it because of the fierce battle with the antidemons, but we confirmed a super huge antidemon from a distance. It must be the cannon-type.  It moved slowly, so it arrived quite late from the beast-type. I don’t know if the antidemons calculated it, but we overlooked it because of the blinding of the beast-type. </p>
<p>『Don’t Miss that big thing!』</p>
<p>  The cannon-type that appeared this time was much larger than the one we had seen before. It was probably more than five times its size, not even twice as big.  The one we defeated before was about the size of a tank, but this one was about the size of a large tank gun?  No, it’s even bigger. It might be at the level of a fortress equipped with a large cannon.  It’s over thirty, and I could see it continuing in single file. </p>
<p>「That guy is a little weird.」</p>
<p>『What?  Who’s he?』</p>
<p>「That’s it.」</p>
<p>  Let’s take a look at the cannon-type that Fran pointed to. Then, as Fran said, there was a cannon-type that was wearing a strange aura.  When I observed it, I saw that the aura of that aura became thicker, and the cannon-type disappeared.  I thought it would turn invisible, but it was not that precise. It probably acted like a mirror to hide its appearance to a certain extent. It was quite troublesome, considering that we overlooked it this time. </p>
<p>「It’s got a little more mana from them.」</p>
<p>『Get ready for a bombardment!』</p>
<p>  It seemed to be a type of bullet that struck with a deadly shot rather than a series of shots.This is quite a nuisance considering that we overlooked it this time.  </p>
<p>「It’s building up their magic power little by little.」</p>
<p>『They’re getting ready to fire at us!』</p>
<p>  It seemed they were not the type to fire consecutive shots, but rather the type to charge up shots and shoot powerful ones.  I couldn’t even tell how destructive that power-oriented attack from such huge antidemons was. Judging from the enormous amount of magic power increasing, it was not surprising that they could be as powerful as Extreme Magic.  Moreover, that was the number of them. It seemed that Mea and Velmeria thought the same way.  </p>
<p>「Fran!  Velmeria!  You’re going to crush them with Lind! Zefmate and I will take care of this!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「Okay!」</p>
<p>「Quoour!」</p>
<p>  Right now, we don’t have time to discuss who’s left. Fran and Velmeria nodded immediately and jumped out of the place. In the meantime, the magic power of the cannon-type continued to rise.</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
