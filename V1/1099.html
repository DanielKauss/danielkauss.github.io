</div><h1>Chapter 1099</h1><p>But despite his pitiful appearance, Baron Noare was quite tough.</p>
<p>He never admits that he is his traitor, and continues to act as a fool and arrogant nobleman. Even though he is covered in blood, he will only say that he does not know.</p>
<p>「...Urushi」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Hyah!」</p>
<p>The baron simply sat back down after the wolf suddenly appeared in front of him. No wait, it looks like he’s slacking off, but this is just another act.</p>
<p>That’s great how thoroughly they’ve gone all the way here.</p>
<p>「Yes」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>「W-What are you trying to do? Don’t! I’m not sure it tastes good!」</p>
<p>「Fufun. I’m trying to see if I can keep saying that I don’t know, even if it bites me alive」</p>
<p>「Grrrrr!」</p>
<p>「Hyaah!」</p>
<p>Was this scream really serious? She must have remembered that the confessed poison that Urushi had learned was more effective when mentally weakened.</p>
<p>After scaring and screaming several times against Baron Noare with a stick, it was finally Urushi’s turn. I let the gray smoke hit the Baron to take away his discernment.</p>
<p>It had to be bathed many times over for the delicate, but it only worked once for Viscount Noare. That must be related to his resistance to poison.</p>
<p>His expression dropped from the baron’s face, and he was no longer able to feel his will. After confirming this, Fran asked him the question again.</p>
<p>「Where is Raydoss’s scout?」</p>
<p>「I don’t know」</p>
<p>「I know you have escaped here.」</p>
<p>「I’ve been invited to this mansion, but I can’t see him anymore. I don’t know where he is」</p>
<p>Seriously, the baron didn’t even know himself. Apparently, he was hiding somewhere in the mansion.</p>
<p>I could feel them. But even we didn’t know their exact location.</p>
<p>「We have no choice. Let’s capture the evidence while we search the mansion」</p>
<p>「Okay」</p>
<p>While searching for the spy, she conquered the Baron’s mansion at once with her sea of people tactics. However, she failed to find the whereabouts of the spy until the very end.</p>
<p>We went around all the rooms, including the basement. Some of them looked suspicious, but we just couldn’t find them.</p>
<p>Somehow, there was a room in the mansion that smelled a little unusual, and the scent was a little stronger? Well, I’m a sword, so I can’t smell it though. It was just a matter of image.</p>
<p>There were almost no documents coming out. However, he had succeeded in seizing a few tools to secretly reveal his identity with a person from Raidos. For example, a knife with an emblem engraved on it and the other party, and a vial for medicine.</p>
<p>When we asked Viscount Noare, he said that there was really no better proof of it. There was no suspicious facility such as a basement, so he was trying to be sure that no one suspected him.</p>
<p>(Secretary, I don’t know where he is.)</p>
<p>『Hmmm, it seems like we’re going to keep hiding until we leave.』</p>
<p>(Arf.)</p>
<p>I guess they were just going to hide and then run away when we’re gone. The only reason they didn’t run away in their current state was whether they were very confident in their stealth abilities, or whether they realized that they couldn’t escape by seeing through Fran and Urushi’s abilities.</p>
<p>『I’d like to try and catch it somehow, but...』</p>
<p>(Leave it to me.)</p>
<p>『Oh? Do you have a plan?』</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
<p>Fran nodded confidently. She seemed to have come up with a way to detect Raydoss’s stealth.</p>
<p>(Can I do it?)</p>
<p>『It’s fine, but are you okay without any help?』</p>
<p>(Nn. I can do it by myself!)</p>
<p>Fran has been in her training mode since the mock battle with Gamudo a while ago. She probably wanted to do what she could by herself.</p>
<p>『If it’s getting dangerous, I’ll just lay a hand on it, okay?』</p>
<p>(Nn. Please.)</p>
<p>Fran nodded lightly and crouched down on the ground to activate her magic.</p>
<p>「Great Wall.」</p>
<p>A huge earth wall then interrupted the northern part of Noare’s mansion.</p>
<p>「Eh? What is it?」</p>
<p>「What’s going on!」</p>
<p>「What kind of magic is it...?」</p>
<p>Not only Baron Noaret, but also our allies, Blue, and the soldiers, were surprised. Some of the soldiers were sitting on their knees.</p>
<p>『Fran, I think we should tell her about it beforehand, right?』</p>
<p>(?)</p>
<p>『Soldier-san, you’re surprised, right?』</p>
<p>「Hmm. I’m going to use magic after all」</p>
<p>After I told Blue that, I activated Great Wall again without waiting for the other party’s reaction.</p>
<p>A wall appeared to the west and east of the mansion and surrounded them. There was a slight wavering in the mysterious presence. The mansion that was hidden must have been suddenly surrounded by a huge wall and was surprised.</p>
<p>But before we could make a run, the rest of the room was completely covered with huge walls.</p>
<p>「Phew. Well then, I’ll do it next time」</p>
<p>「Eh?」</p>
<p>With the confused-looking blues in the shadows, Fran jumped up to the top of the wall and peeked inside, activating a new spell.</p>
<p>「Thunder Chain!」</p>
<p>It had low attack power but high paralyzing power. Fran’s strategy must have been to block the escape route with a wall and then indiscriminately hit the lightning magic inside.</p>
<p>Well, it certainly doesn’t matter if he was hiding in there... But thanks to Fran’s magic, which was released without a pause, Baron Noare’s mansion was half destroyed.</p>
<p>『I guess, this is not going to be easy for us』</p>
<p>「Hmm?」</p>
<p>『He didn’t show up.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Does magic not work? Her presence was still weak as usual, maybe it was not only her ability to hide, but also her fighting ability was high.</p>
<p>「Then try this!」</p>
<p>Fran released more magic. What a surprise, it was Thor’s Hammer. Even if we could find out where our opponent was, it wouldn’t kill them... Also, even if they were to hide their faces, they wouldn’t be able to identify us if we used this flashy lightning magic...</p>
<p>But before I could stop it, a thick lightning bolt engulfed the mansion.</p>
