</div><h1>Chapter 1062</h1><p>The captives were said to have been captured in the center of Dars. As we headed to check with the unconscious magic beastman in tow, we saw people sitting in the open-air square with shackles on their hands. What are they going to do if it rains? I wonder what kind of captives they should get wet right now? Charlotte was sitting in the center of the square, so she didn’t seem to be injured. </p>
<p>(Shaltlotte!)</p>
<p>『Wait a minute. The man next door is pretty strong.』</p>
<p> The man next door is pretty strong, you know?』</p>
<p>(Mnh.)</p>
<p>  There were only a few soldiers guarding the entire group.  They must have been sent to the harbor and defeated by us, about thirty people. Moreover, I could see that they were on the loose.  </p>
<p>「W-What’s the harbor!?」</p>
<p>「I’ve heard that the enemy is on a rampage, but I don’t know the specifics......!」</p>
<p>「The battle is over, but...!」</p>
<p> The gray-haired swordsman standing next to Charlotte was of a different rank.  He emitted the aura of a strong person and was proudly aware of his surroundings. So, it was obvious that only one of them was on a different level. Fran pondered as she was hiding in the shadows and waiting to see what he would do.  </p>
<p>(Master, what do we do?)</p>
<p>『It’s too risky to go head-on, you know?』</p>
<p>  We could destroy the enemy soldiers in a short time. Even if we are taken hostage, I’m confident that my surprise attack can defeat the enemies without hurting the hostages.  This is unless we are dealing with a swordsman beside Charlotte.  However, the man had a presence similar to Marl.  Perhaps he has been modified.  However, he does not have a slave collar, so he is obeying Raidos on his own volition? So, he was obeying Raidos on his own volition?  Anyways, as long as he was not a puppet, it meant that he had lived with experience and thinking ability.  If we challenge him head-on, he was not going to lose.  However, there was no doubt that there would be considerable damage. Normal attacks are no good.  </p>
<p>(Woof!)</p>
<p>『Ooh! You’ve returned, Urushi!』</p>
<p>  It was a good time.  They had evacuated the adventurers out of town and had returned.  With Urushi’s help, there would be a good chance that they would be able to save the captured people.  </p>
<p>(How should we do――)</p>
<p>『I see―』</p>
<p> Woof― We thought about the strategy and decided to take action. Fran jumped up using an aerial jump and moved to the rooftop of the building that overlooks the plaza in secret. There, she activated her light magic, conscious of not leaking any magic power.  </p>
<p>「Uwaah!」</p>
<p>「What the hell is that!?」</p>
<p>  The soldiers were amazed to see the sudden appearance of a glowing object above the plaza. They may have expected it to have something to do with the anomaly in the harbor, but they didn’t seem to know how to respond.  In the first place, it was just a sphere of light that had no offensive power. The purpose was to create a dark shadow by sunlight and strong light.  </p>
<p>「Shut up!  Be careful of your surroundings!」</p>
<p>『I knew it, that man was troublesome』</p>
<p>  The soldier started making a commotion, and the gray-haired swordsman shouted at him and fell silent. Immediately after that, the man pulled out his sword from the item bag at his waist.  Even from a distance, I could feel a chilling magic power coming from him. It must be a very level magic sword.  The man held up his magic sword on the spot and shaked it off.  The slash that was fired hit the ball of light and obliterated it―― but this one is a split second faster! </p>
<p>『Urushi!』</p>
<p>(Woof!)</p>
<p> Urushi, who had been building up his magic next to Fran, activated his shadow magic before the man could destroy the ball of light.  The shadows at his feet turned into spears and skewered the soldiers one after another. He was able to hardly react at all because he was watching the light in the sky. Only the swordsmen had avoided it.  That would have probably knocked half of them down. Not only the soldiers in the square but also the soldiers on the roofs of the surrounding buildings were falling in the blood. The other half was my job.  A few seconds later I was late for Urushi’s attack.  Using the steel threads that I stretched out throughout the plaza, I used ice and snow magic against the nearby soldiers at once.  I had planned to hit the swordsmen in the first place, but I gave up on that plan.  The swordsman stepped forward a few steps and closed the distance from Charlotte.  He couldn’t make a careless attack on the swordsmen as long as they might get caught up in it. That was an frustratingly precise decision. </p>
<p>「Gyiaaaaah!」</p>
<p>「Ugyaaah!」</p>
<p>  I used the ice and snow magic, i. e.  with thunder magic and flame magic, it was difficult to target only the soldiers. I could have used land magic, but ice and snow magic had an advantage. If they couldn’t kill them, the cold air would take away their strength and slow them down.  </p>
<p>『Is there anyone moving?』</p>
<p>(Nn.  We’ve defeated all the soldiers in the square.)</p>
<p>『What’s the soldier?』</p>
<p>  I really didn’t know that it could block both Urushi and I from attacking... But this was well within our expectations again.  </p>
<p>(Urushi!)</p>
<p>「Grr!」</p>
<p>「This is...  Why are there so many magic beasts in here!?」</p>
<p>「Grrrr!  Gaaaa!」</p>
<p>「Kyaa!」</p>
<p>「There’s no way they’re wild... But it’s just a woman...」</p>
<p>  Urushi unleashed a dark spear, which wounded Charlotte’s skin.  I’m sorry to Charlotte, but I was forced to attack it as if it was a shock. I’ll apologize later, so please endure it for now!  Urushi was acting like a bloodthirsty beast. The swordsman was also at a loss for words as to where Urushi was after Charlotte launched a lightly wounded attack.  They hesitated for a moment whether or not to take him as a hostage. Fran and I didn’t miss that.  </p>
<p>『Now!』</p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>  Fran slashes at him as soon as she teleported.  However, I didn’t feel her blade slicing through the flesh of a swordsman. Instead, she clashed with the tough one, and we clashed with the brigade.  It was a male magic sword.  You’d react at this timing too!  But this was just what we planned! Well, it would have been great if we could defeat it with this powerful attack!  </p>
<p>「This is...!  Nuoourgh!」</p>
<p>「Let’s go together!」</p>
<p>『Urushi, move as planned!』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  Fran and I pushed our opponent into the Dimension Gate at her feet.  Even this man, as expected, could not escape while fighting with Fran. If he escaped forcibly, he would be caught up in Fran’s attack.  The teleportation destination was the harbor. Fran tried to cut down the man while holding back, but despite the floating feeling of the teleportation, she regrouped and parried it. </p>
<p>「Little girl, don’t do this」</p>
<p>Both eyes clashed, and they grinned out of nowhere.Both eyes clashed, and they grinned out of nowhere. Oh, and the gray-haired swordsman in front of us was also a combat maniac.</p>
