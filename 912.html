</div><h1>Chapter 912</h1><p>With Mea’s participation, the front was now much more stable. Despite Sophie’s healing power, she was able to strip the antidemons down with little wear and tear. Even if her enemy was only the higher tier jet-black type, she was able to continue the battle without any injuries. Fran and Mea’s black and white duos worked together to defeat the antidemons and maintain their front lines. Velmeria and Zefmate were on their left and right sides. Velmeria was using water magic and spears to attack the antidemons while flying high in the air. Velmeria was using water magic and spears to attack the antidemons as she flew through the air at high speeds.  Her speed was so impressive that even an afterimage could be created.  Moreover, by releasing magic power from her wings, she could reach its maximum speed in an instant. It was even possible to open her wings and perform a sudden stop, and I was impressed by her slow movements.  She also had excellent defense, as she repelled the antidemons’ attacks by covering her entire body with scales.He also excelled in defense, repelling the antidemons’ attacks by growing scales all over his body.  As I thought, he didn’t seem to have become a dragon, but he seemed to be able to imitate some of his body.  Fran used to dominate in the mock battles before, but it’s not gonna be easy anymore.  Zefmate had also evolved as a surprise.  Oh, and that doesn’t mean he’s evolved as a beastman. Well, the way he used his Innate Skills was completely different from before, though I was wondering if he really had evolved one more time and learned a different Innate Skill.  The blue cat species, the blue leopard, had an Innate Skill called the “Leopard” skill. It should have been a skill that combined speed gain and aerial jump. In fact, Zefmate, who we had fought before, was good at high-mobility combat by using the leopard’s leg skill to move around at super high speeds.  Of course, he was still moving at high speeds in the same way as before.  However, the number of hits was no comparison to before. </p>
<p>『It’s just a twin swords at that speed that’s bad enough』</p>
<p>(Is that kicking?)</p>
<p>『Yeah.  I’m going to use my leash for attacks』</p>
<p> Zefmate, who used to fight with twin swords, now used to use martial arts even more.  It seemed that he was wearing a leash on a kick, and the antidemons were slain in both spa and spa attacks.  He jumped on his neck with a high kick and fell on his heel, breaking his body vertically. The antidemons were slaughtered on each flash of his blue magic-powered foot sword.  Moreover, his movements were not as linear as before.  He rotated up, down, left, and right, and it was very tricky. Not only did he move like a spinning skater, but he also used a lot of side rolls and capoeil movements.  He then used that rotation to keep on rolling out his twin swords and his legs.  Simple calculations showed that his number of hits was twice as many as before. Moreover, the speed at which she was hit had increased dramatically due to her trickyness and destructive power.  Her fighting style had changed to such an extent that she could no longer be called a different person from Zefmate when she fought in the martial arts tournament.  Before, I had thought that the Blue Heavenly Tiger’s leash skill was a subversion of the Black Heavenly Tiger’s Brilliant Lightning Rush. That was probably why the blue cats hate the black cats.  But now that I’ve seen Zefmate, I can understand that I was wrong. He was a skill that integrated offense and defense, and rather, a skill whose main goal was attack.  It seemed that the skills that increased the power of kicks could also be used to move around.  So, I’m not sure that Zefmate couldn’t master it in the past though... I wonder do the blue cats have any know-how to master the use of leopard legs? </p>
<p>「Zefmate is very strong」</p>
<p>  Fran was looking at Zefmate with an excited look.  The blood of a battle junkie must have been ached at the sight of his strength.  In other words, he was so strong that Fran wanted to have a mock battle with him. Maybe she could have a match with Colbert?  Velmeria and Zefmate, who had grown up and become stronger, were as reliable as Mea. Behind Fran and Urushi, there were defensive lines set up by the Beastmen Union, but there were almost no antidemons flowing over them. Fran and Urushi’s morale increased as their friends came to the rescue, and they no longer seemed to feel defeated.  As we continued to fight, our enemy commander finally showed up. There were four guard-types guarding the commander at Castel, and a red horned knight with a larger body than usual in the center of it.  </p>
<p>「I will take commander. You all stay black.」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  Fran obeyed Mea’s words and turned her sword to the guard-type. Not only did she know that she was not in top form, but she also wanted to know how much Mea had grown. However, the results of the battle after that were much different from what we had imagined. Compared to the antidemons we fought at Castel, this was a single point, so this was not something we could call a formidable foe.  The vanguard-type was instant killer. And the large red horned knights were also much inferior to the Uniques that were Castel’s bosses.  They awakened, turned into ashes in less than a minute in front of Mea, clad in gold and white fire, and disappeared. Their shoulders looked more translucent. </p>
<p>「Hmm, I guess they’re at least used to doing odd jobs.」</p>
<p>「Mea, so cool!」</p>
<p>「Fuhahaha!  Of course!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p> The antidemons were still around, and Fran and Urushi were continuing to fight. However, the pressure had diminished to the point that they ran out while chatting.  We’ll have to wipe out the rest later. I wondered what would happen for a time, but in the end, there would be no damage――  </p>
<p>『Aah!  A newbie huh!?』</p>
<p>「Great speed.」</p>
<p>  Just when we were relieved, we caught the appearance of a newbie.  It was surprisingly fast. Wasn’t they nearly ten times faster than the speed of antidemons in the past?  At this rate, we should arrive in this city in less than five minutes.  Moreover, the presence was so thick that the number of them seemed to be very large. Could it be that even the antidemons we had been in a fierce battle with were their vanguard?A new kind of despair was about to come over us.</p>
