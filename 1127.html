</div><h1>Chapter 1127</h1><p>The main force of our Adventurers Guild was engaged in war with the troops of the Raidos Kingdom together with the knights of the Kranzel Kingdom.</p>
<p>It was located in a hilly area south-east of the Raidos Kingdom, and was a key defensive measure in front of the largest city in the south, the Raidos Kingdom, the ‘Raidos Fort’.</p>
<p>Before we attacked Raydoss, we didn’t really know the geography of the continent, but we did get a rough map based on information from occupied villages and captives, as well as from documents obtained from our base.</p>
<p>It is obvious from that map that the southern part of Raydoss will be completely divided if we drop the Swyss Fort.</p>
<p>Further north, we found flat land, but this area was filled with magical forests and mountainous areas where many magic beasts lurked. If the road running in all directions around the Swish Fort was no longer available, it would be difficult to even move properly through the southern part of the Kingdom of Raidos.</p>
<p>In the Kingdom of Kranzel, lodging towns could be built at these concentrations of roads, but in Raydoss, forts were built to protect the distribution routes seems to be their top priority.</p>
<p>The knights and adventurers must have been off guard now that they had destroyed the fort so easily. Based on the information obtained from the scout, they had attacked Swish Fort with an unchanged lineup.</p>
<p>But this was not without a hint of Raidos’ trap...</p>
<p>The first reported anomalies were from the raid force that went around the back of the fort. They were a surprise unit that would secretly deploy from the back entrance of the fort, and a unit that was responsible for interfering with the supplies coming from the outside.</p>
<p>At this point, the Kranzel Kingdom still thought that they had an overwhelming advantage. There were only a few soldiers trapped in the fort, and it could not be said that the fort’s defense was high.</p>
<p>Our plan was to encircle it and slowly make it through the fort as we had done before.</p>
<p>However, the first bad news came immediately after the war ended. About 500 migratory troops were attacked and destroyed by the same number of undead. Moreover, there was no telling where the undead that had retreated had disappeared.</p>
<p>Was there some kind of hidden passageway somewhere? Or was there some Jean-level magician there?</p>
<p>Either way, it was different from the fortifications we had seen in the past. I am sure that this feeling will be confirmed by the next report.</p>
<p>They also told us that the long-range magic from the fort had caused damage to the front lines. There were magicians among the enemy soldiers before, but there were not many of them.</p>
<p>But the fort was filled with magicians who were all part of the troop. They were a force to be reckoned with. Like I thought, we shouldn’t let our guard down this time.</p>
<p>However, the commanders of Kranzel seemed to have little sense of urgency. They went to suggest a change in strategy, but did not expect them to be drinking tea in the camp.</p>
<p>「So, do you mean to say that we will not change our policy at all?」</p>
<p>「That’s right. We will send out a raid force once again and attack them head-on. We will immediately deploy them.」</p>
<p>「That fort is quite dangerous. Correct your strategy!」</p>
<p>「Hmm. One just needs to break through the traps head-on. Don’t talk to us adventurers! Just keep your mouths shut!」</p>
<p>The nobles, one of the commanders of this army, responded to my words with an annoyed look on their faces. Each noble family led their own soldiers to participate in the battle, but this man was the center of the many soldiers who led the way. He was also a count and had a strong say in the battle.</p>
<p>They had been providing backup and support for a long time, but it seemed that they saw this fort attack as the main force of the war. They were also participating in the strategy council, which used to only send substitutes.</p>
<p>Until now, they had been working together with the knights and high-ranking adventurers to plan a strategy, but......</p>
<p>He could not help but offend the nobles with their 3,000 soldiers, and they accepted his words. Well, the plan itself was to take over the previous plan, and I hadn’t heard any rumors that it was greedy but incompetent.</p>
<p>However, because of this, he misunderstood that we were to follow him.</p>
<p>It seems the battlefield didn’t know that the knights’ will was of the utmost importance. Kranzel’s law told them that the battlefield should follow the knights. Well, still, we couldn’t despise the nobles, but they were allowed to disagree.</p>
<p>Moreover, the guild had great authority this time, so they had no obligation to obey it unconditionally. The adventurers agreed that they shouldn’t be taking advantage of the reckless work of the nobles, and I was the one who voiced their disagreement.</p>
<p>The only one who didn’t understand was why I was here. I know that it was because the commander, Forrund, was not very good at talking. But there were other high-ranked adventurers, I didn’t know? Well, he was one who had more contact with nobles though...</p>
<p>「If they found out about us, wouldn’t the squadron be meaningless?」</p>
<p>「Now I’ll send you a thousand times as much! Now we can return the undead that attacked us!」</p>
<p>「There will be no adventurers among them, you know?」</p>
<p>「What the hell! I’m sure there are too many adventurers left over!」</p>
<p>「I don’t have any leftover. All of them have some sort of work assigned to them, and you don’t have the authority to command them. If you want to do it, please divide it up based on your own forces」</p>
<p>「But――」</p>
<p>What part of him was incompetent at all? No, it was not incompetent, it was just too greedy to see what was going on around him?</p>
<p>In this case, Zenos-sama, who is said to be incompetent, is not more capable. She must have understood that she had no ability and was not reckless.</p>
<p>In addition, she was quite friendly enough to send troops to a competent commander. If they are disrespectful to the royals, they will go around protecting their faces, but they are usually easy to deal with.</p>
<p>Anyways, after a long and arduous argument, I managed to get the word out. The adventurers were now accompanies to reckless operations, so they didn’t die in vain.</p>
<p>As I was relieved, I heard a loud scream behind us.</p>
<p>「At the north gate, it seems the outlaws were reluctant to send troops because of the impending war between the gangs.」</p>
<p>This was just like the battle that Jean had defeated the Raidos Kingdom. The position of the enemy was reversed though.</p>
<p>This isn’t good. If Jean had someone as skilled as him, the army would swell up by eating the soldiers of the nobility.</p>
<p>We have to hurry and go to the rescue――</p>
<p>「D-Donad-san!」</p>
<p>「What’s wrong?」</p>
<p>「The enemy army has come out of the fort!」</p>
<p>「What!」</p>
<p>Just as my subordinates had shouted, the gate to the Swift Fort was opened and I saw a surge of red armored knights pouring out.</p>
<p>「Shit! We have to hold on to that one, or you’ll be in trouble! Adventurers, gather around me!」</p>
