</div><h1>Chapter 913</h1><p>In the face of the approaching antidemon, Fran and Urushi were discussing what to do next. Well, there were very few things they could do.</p>
<p>They would fight just like this, abandon the city and escape. They would all fight together by gathering the strength of the city’s forces.</p>
<p>That’s about it.</p>
<p>We don’t have time to evacuate everyone in Sendia, and if people were to run in large numbers in the first place, the antidemons would follow them.</p>
<p>In the end, Fran and the others stalled the antidemons, and Sophie, the most well-rounded of the group, went around to look for reinforcements.</p>
<p>「Urushi, carry Sophie on your back.」</p>
<p>「Woof...」</p>
<p>「Don’t worry. I’ll endure it until reinforcements arrive. So, please」</p>
<p>『We can only ask Urushi for it』</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>Urushi looked hesitant for a moment, but he must have understood the importance of the job of bringing in reinforcements. He nodded reluctantly with worried eyes.</p>
<p>「My partner will fill the gap between Urushi and Sophie. Come on, Lind!」</p>
<p>「Woooof!」</p>
<p>What Mea called was the dragon, Lind, that resided in her sword. I guess the reason she didn’t call it from the beginning was that there was a time limit on summoning it.</p>
<p>「Long time no see, Lind!」</p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>Fran stroked Lind and cried happily. From the way he looked so cute, it was hard to believe that he was a super-existent within the Divine Sword.</p>
<p>Yes, Mea held the Dragon Sword Lind, which was a Divine Sword. Its original name was the Destroyer Dragon Sword, Lyndovrum, which was a Divine Sword that allowed you to summon a super huge dragon.</p>
<p>However, Mea wasn’t able to make full use of her Lindwurm, and her best bet was to summon the small flying dragon, Lind.</p>
<p>But did she just get a little bigger than before?</p>
<p>When I saw it before, it looked like a red low-level flying dragon. Now I could call it a fire dragon. It was about two large in total, and the presence of scales and horns were increasing.</p>
<p>It seems that thanks to Mea’s growth, Lind has also grown.</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>Urushi barked as he stared at Lind. But as if to respond, Lind barked briefly.</p>
<p>It was as if they were saying 「Leave it to me」 or 「Leave it to me」. In fact, it was similar to that.</p>
<p>「Well then, let’s go」</p>
<p>「Nn. Sophie, do it!」</p>
<p>「We’ll definitely bring back the reinforcements.」</p>
<p>Sophie got on Urushi’s back with a gloomy look on her face and headed back into town. All that was left was to keep her busy until Sophie sent troops from the various organizations.</p>
<p>As we waited, we saw a second wave of antidemons approaching us.</p>
<p>「A pack of beast-types huh!?」</p>
<p>「I can see it’s big too」</p>
<p>Just as Mea and Velmeria said, the new antidemons were mainly beast-types that walked on four legs. I now understand why they moved so fast, even though their scale was several times larger than before.</p>
<p>Fran and I activated our spells as the antidemons rushed towards us.</p>
<p>It created countless spears of rocks with land magic. I tried to imitate the image of a spear growing diagonally toward its opponent, like a fence for horses.</p>
<p>Unable to avoid the hundreds of spears that suddenly appeared, the leader of the antidemons rushed toward the rocky horse’s barrier.</p>
<p>Many of them escaped, but they succeeded in killing their momentum.</p>
<p>As the back was slightly clogged, the density of the front group increased. Then, all the attacks they unleashed rained down on us.</p>
<p>Velmeria’s water magic, Mea’s white silver flames, Lind’s crimson flames, Zefmate’s shockwaves, and our thunderbolts.</p>
<p>The rain of the long-range attacks that we unleashed in rapid succession, without any concern for any minor strain, succeeded in dissipating over 10,000 antidemons in just a few minutes.</p>
<p>Even so, this was less than 10% of the whole group, but we were able to attract the attention of our enemies. I wanted to draw as much attention as possible to this place.</p>
<p>Fran and Mea then charged at the antidemons who had pierced through the walls of dirt and smoke.</p>
<p>The battle was different from before. Wolf, tiger, bear, and various other beast-types attacked us without formation.</p>
<p>I thought it would be easier if the two didn’t work together, but that was not the case. It was also difficult to get the right timing, and it was also difficult to evade any all-out attack that didn’t mind killing each other.</p>
<p>Fran and her party continued to use their trump cards to defeat the two-sided antidemons. Mea was probably the most violent of the bunch.</p>
<p>The Beast King was also using his self-defense with gold flames. That ability was too vicious in a disorderly brawl. After all, if an enemy were to rush in, it would be burned down by flames and defeated on its own.</p>
<p>Because of her magical power, the antidemons seemed completely un wary of Mea. If things continued like this, the antidemons would probably continue to self-destruct.</p>
<p>Velmeria was also much stronger than I had imagined.</p>
<p>I finally used Dragon Form, but its entire body was covered with light blue scales and an enormous amount of magic power swirled around it. It seemed that its defense was dramatically enhanced by covering it with water like armor.</p>
<p>If water armor was added to my artifact equipment, I wouldn’t be able to get as many wounds as a furrow on a par attack. Without any attempt to defend against the antidemons’ attacks, I just went all out to counter them.</p>
<p>The toughest part was Zefmate, huh? Even though she’s getting stronger, she’s not in Rank A yet. Over time, her wounds were on the rise.</p>
<p>Should we protect this? But just as I was thinking that, Zefmate shouted.</p>
<p>「Heaven’s leg!」</p>
<p>It seemed that the skills of the blue leopard were not limited to those of the leopard legs. The Black Heavenly Tiger could use multiple skills, and the other beastmen must have the same skills.</p>
<p>The skill “Divine Legs” was a type of skill that strengthened the legs. It increased its speed even more than before. The maximum speed would be more than Mea.</p>
<p>It looked like we would be able to stabilize the antidemons for a while. Well, I don’t know if it was safe to say that we would stabilize everyone in their death battle.</p>
<p>But none of them could think of anything else in the future. In fact, they had no time to think. One thousand warriors each put their lives on the line to defeat the antidemons.</p>
<p>That’s how we stalled the antidemons, but there was another movement in the horde.</p>
<p>「There’s a huge antidemon in the back!」</p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>Velmeria and Lind, who were in midair, shouted a warning. We didn’t notice them due to the fierce battle with the antidemons, but we could see the huge antidemons from a distance.</p>
<p>That must be the cannon-type.</p>
<p>We arrived a little later than the beast-types because of the slow movement of the antidemons. I don’t know if the antidemons had calculated it, but we had overlooked the beast-types because of their blinding behavior.</p>
<p>『I never thought I’d miss that huge thing!』</p>
<p>The cannon-type that appeared this time was far larger than the one we had seen before. It was probably more than five times larger than the one we saw before.</p>
<p>My last cannon-type was about the size of a tank, while this one was about the size of a large tank gun. No, it was even bigger than that. It might even be at the level of a fortification equipped with a cannon.</p>
<p>There were over 30 of them. I could see them coming in a line.</p>
<p>「He’s a little weird」</p>
<p>『What? Who is it?』</p>
<p>「That」</p>
<p>I take a look at the bombardment-type that Fran pointed to. Then, as she said, there was a cannon-type that wore a strange aura.</p>
<p>When I observed it, I saw that its aura thickened, and the cannon-type disappeared. I thought it might have turned invisible, but it was not that precise. It was probably something like a mirror, which hid itself to some extent.</p>
<p>This is quite a bother considering that we overlooked it this time.</p>
<p>「And their magic power has increased little by little」</p>
<p>『Get ready to shoot!』</p>
<p>She seemed to be the type to fire powerful shots instead of firing a series of shots. I couldn’t even tell how destructive the attack was, such as the power-oriented attacks unleashed by such huge antidemons.</p>
<p>Considering the enormous amount of magic power that was increasing, it was not surprising that it was on the level of Extreme Magic.</p>
<p>That’s a lot. We had to stop the bombardment.</p>
<p>Mea and Velmeria seemed to think so as well.</p>
<p>「Fran! Velmeria! Let’s destroy them with Lind! I and Zefmate will take care of this!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「Okay!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Now we don’t have time to discuss who will remain. Fran and the others nodded immediately and jumped out of their positions.</p>
<p>At the same time, the magic power of the cannon-type began to increase further.</p>
<p>『This is bad!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
