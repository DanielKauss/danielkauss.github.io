</div><h1>Chapter 1078</h1><p>「...Fran-san. I’m leaving soon」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「More on that later.」</p>
<p>Satya waved her hand lightly to Fran and quietly disappeared into the shadows. She was supposed to meet up with Fran once she had arrived in town.</p>
<p>Satya’s demons took away the body of Fran and the demon knight.</p>
<p>「Is that so?」</p>
<p>『It seems life magic has a good ability to heal, so I don’t have to worry about it』</p>
<p>Fran looked worried as she stared in the direction the demon was leaving. Her feelings of guilt for being unable to protect Fran had probably not disappeared yet. But talking to Satya seemed to have made her feel much better.</p>
<p>「...Raidos, I will never forgive him.」</p>
<p>It seemed that she had enough time to express her anger at Raidos Kingdom. The anger that had been directed at the Southern and Eastern Dukes in Raidos was now directed at them as a whole.</p>
<p>『Fran. It’s perfectly fine to be angry, but the people of the village would be scared if we went back in that condition』</p>
<p>「Mrgh.」</p>
<p>『Let’s calm down a little. Wha?』</p>
<p>「Nn. Thank you, Master」</p>
<p>Fran took several deep breaths on the spot, quelling her own anger. After calming down, we returned to the people of Metelmam, all of them were worried.</p>
<p>After all, they had been silent for almost an hour. A big wolf and a man who was sucked into his mouth had been added in as well.</p>
<p>It would be strange if we didn’t feel uneasy about this. After talking to the village chief about the delicates, he didn’t seem to know anything about this guy.</p>
<p>But apparently, no one thought it would change while they were disguised and blended in with the villagers. After all, it’s not like no one was coming here from anywhere else.</p>
<p>They must be experts in in infiltrating, hiding, and manipulating. I was really lucky to have caught this guy here.</p>
<p>『Urushi, you can eat as much spicy food as you want later!』</p>
<p>「Huh!」</p>
<p>(Master! Me too!)</p>
<p>『I know. Fran has done her best, and you can eat as much curry as you want』</p>
<p>(Really?)</p>
<p>『Yeah!』</p>
<p>(I did it!)</p>
<p>If you feel a little better after eating a lot of smug, then you can eat as much as you want.</p>
<p>After that, we reached rockers without any problems. Everyone cheered when they saw the wall of rockers before the sun was completely set.</p>
<p>This progress was probably also thanks to the fact that the villagers followed her almost without any complaints. That was probably due to Fran’s strength and their sense of urgency for the village being attacked.</p>
<p>I reunited with the Chief Soldier, whom we had talked to before when we were greeted by the refugees from Dards, and entrusted the people of Metelmum to him.</p>
<p>「Adventurers-dono, thank you very much. It is thanks to you that there were no deaths in the village.」</p>
<p>「......Nn.」</p>
<p>「Very well...」</p>
<p>The look on the old man’s face as he thanked us was apparently complicated. Even though he didn’t know much about the relationship between Fran and Fran, he knew that his friend had fallen into an unconscious weight. But this friend had been trying to kill himself.</p>
<p>But the old man seemed to have given it an answer.</p>
<p>「It’s a pity for your friend. I’ll pray for a quick recovery」</p>
<p>「......Thanks.」</p>
<p>「Very well then」</p>
<p>Fran shook the elders with a little smile and then parted ways with them.</p>
<p>(The people of Metermam were glad to be saved.)</p>
<p>『Yeah, you’re right』</p>
<p>『Today is the day we’ll go to the guild.』</p>
<p>「Satya?」</p>
<p>「Fran-san, come here!」</p>
<p>Satya had gone into the lockers before she knew it. She was wearing a hood deep in her eyes and was hiding her face.</p>
<p>「First, let’s go to the Adventurers Guild.」</p>
<p>「Yes」</p>
<p>We plan to report this to the guild first and then have them introduce us to the Feudal Lord of this town. We’ll have to discuss what to do with Derick’s personal life after all. In fact, the effects of Satya’s poison had already been lifted and he was now back.</p>
<p>They had tied their arms and mouths, and had no one leg. Besides, they didn’t have to worry about running away since Urushi was still sucking them. But for now.</p>
<p>I’m wondering how I can keep this guy safe, since he already has skills for rope, flexibility, and unlocking.</p>
<p>『We can’t have them following us to the inn...』</p>
<p>The easiest way would be to hurt them and force them to make a slave contract. But even if it were an enemy, Fran would never accept it and wouldn’t let them. If the guild master said that, they would probably go berserk and go on a rampage.</p>
<p>Without a good idea, Fran and Urushi arrived at the Adventurers Guild. They almost made a lot of noise when they saw the giant Urushi, but the guards managed to keep him quiet there.</p>
<p>Thanks to the greater number of security guards than usual, they were able to arrive at the scene promptly. soldiers were there to guide us along the way.</p>
<p>Urushi entered Fran’s shadow, and Derick dragged Fran with her collar tied around her neck. This guy pretended to be powerless and motionless, but his eyes stared at the surroundings for a moment. He was clearly looking for an opening to escape.</p>
<p>Fran didn’t notice it, but I guess I’ve seen it perfectly. I knew we were not going to let our guard down.</p>
<p>「Fran-dono, have you brought back the people of Metelmum?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>It seemed that they had already contacted us, and the guild master greeted us.</p>
<p>「Looks like a lot happened...」</p>
<p>Seeing how delicate Fran was dragging, he must have guessed that it didn’t end peacefully.</p>
<p>「Can I ask you to tell me about it?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Is that guy? Shall we leave him with you?」</p>
<p>「Okay, I’ll bring him with me too」</p>
<p>「I see, the woman over there? Was that one of Fran-dono’s friends?」</p>
<p>「My friend. Let’s go together.」</p>
<p>「Okay」</p>
<p>Perhaps thinking he was a friend of her adventurers, the guildmaster readily approved of Satya’s companion.</p>
<p>We were led into the guildmaster’s office where he told us everything. Aah, I had protected him with wind and darkness wards, blocking his voice and figure.</p>
<p>After listening to the report, Guild Master looked up to the sky and sighed.</p>
<p>「Seliadot! Are you even listening to me!?」</p>
<p>「I’m sorry for suddenly pushing you in.」</p>
<p>「Hah! What a man! Noble! You really are a princess, huh!?」</p>
<p>「That’s what she says」</p>
<p>「Sigh...... What do you think we should do now?」</p>
<p>「I’ll introduce you to the feudal lord」</p>
<p>When Fran said that, the Guild Master, who kept sighing, shook his head with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>「It’s me!」</p>
<p>「?? Guild master is the feudal lord?」</p>
<p>「It’s just a temporary one. Faber Magran, the fourth son of a Countess of Magran. Immediately after his father died of an illness, there’s this war ruckus. The big brothers are training in the royal capital. So, they won’t be able to return home. Until then, I’ll be their Lord! I’ve only taken half the education of the nobility, you know?」</p>
<p>I didn’t know that. I couldn’t sense any signs of hostility, but I guess this was just what any rural town was like. I’ve heard that nobles, who could not succeed them, would become adventurers, and if they made a achievement, they would become a master of the local guild.</p>
<p>「Let’s send a messenger to the Royal Capital for now. I heard that the Princess of the Kingdom of Philias has contacted us in secret.」</p>
<p>「That’s fine. So, what should we do with this guy?」</p>
<p>「Hmmm. Since he is an important person in Raydoss, we can’t just kill him. We’ll just have to leave him at the guild, so let’s prepare some restraints and watch over him」</p>
<p>「Please do.」</p>
<p>「But first, I want to interrogate it. I also want to back up information on Fran-chan.」</p>
<p>「Okay」</p>
