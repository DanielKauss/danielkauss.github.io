</div><h1>Chapter 1034</h1><p>I could see a light shining from above. It was emitting an ominously powerful magical power with the divine attribute.</p>
<p>Gradually, the light faded into a sphere. It was a large ball of light that emitted dazzling light.</p>
<p>I braced myself for a moment, but the others couldn’t react. They didn’t seem to think in the slightest that something might be dangerous if they felt something strange.</p>
<p>Isario and even Orfalve were standing on the defensive. They were distracted, or rather, they lacked hostility. Anyway, the powerful did not even have weapons in their hands.</p>
<p>I’ve managed to put up a barrier to help the people around me. The others won’t be able to do it in time!</p>
<p>『Kuh!』</p>
<p>I had to brace myself against the expected impact.</p>
<p>But nothing will happen.</p>
<p>『?』</p>
<p>「Don’t worry, I have no intention of harming you.」</p>
<p>Then a stiff voice rang out. Could it be that you look a little like Announcer-san?</p>
<p>『Eh? Who?』</p>
<p>「I am a pillar of the tree that rules over greenery. I am the one you call the Goddess of Wind and Trees」</p>
<p>Haaah? Wasn’t that the Goddess of Grass and Trees? Wasn’t that the Goddess of Forest Trees’ child?</p>
<p>Why? The others seemed unable to move because of the presence of Gods.</p>
<p>「Isario, Hilt, and Fran. They’ve already gotten out of this.」</p>
<p>I guess the reason I was able to move from the start was the same reason why I couldn’t be controlled by the Evil Gods. Since I was a soul from Earth, I was resistant to the presence of Gods.</p>
<p>The ball of light that floated a few meters from the ground continued to talk, regardless of our attitude.</p>
<p>「The reason for my surrender is to punish God.」</p>
<p>A ball of light――the Goddess of Wind and Trees stood out, and a grain of light was released into the surrounding area. However, it quickly gathered in front of the Gods and gradually formed.</p>
<p>It was a person. It was a girl that looked familiar.</p>
<p>『Meltorite......』</p>
<p>Meritte, who should have disappeared along with the giant antidemons, was lying on the earth.</p>
<p>「Here...... Why am I......?」</p>
<p>「I have performed a physical reconstruction, with a soul at its core. You need to atone for your sins. I will punish you.」</p>
<p>Everyone nearby gasped at the quiet yet silent words of the Gods.</p>
<p>No one thought that it was rude. I guess this was just how terrifying Divine Punishment is.</p>
<p>Seliadot had a slightly different expression on his face again. His complexion and breathing were disturbed, probably because something he had been scared of had happened. He muttered in a trembling voice, looking up at the Gods.</p>
<p>「Natural Goddess...」</p>
<p>『What do you mean?』</p>
<p>(A sword, huh? If it was a human-shaped God, I could expect to find mercy and compassion. But if it was a natural God who was not in human form, I wouldn’t find it)</p>
<p>『In other words, she’s not going to drink or do anything like that, or will she just make a decision without blood?』</p>
<p>(That’s right...... They’re not in anger or pain, but they’re not mitigated because of their pity. Besides, Divine Punishment has a strong meaning of being a show to others. When the Goddess of nature is in charge of it, it often comes down to terrible things)</p>
<p>『Or rather, does it depend on the Gods to change the details and extent of the Divine Punishment?』</p>
<p>(In the human world, there are different punishments for different people who give different sentences, right? Even if the sentences are the same, there will be differences in whoever is executioner. Gods are the same)</p>
<p>Even if he was given ten whiplashes, there would be a difference in pain when executed by a muscular man and a skinny man. To be more precise, a different judge could change the sentences for the same crime.</p>
<p>And in the case of the Goddess of nature, it seems that she was often punished with less emotion on all four squares.</p>
<p>(Naturally, the Goddess is probably not interested in people in the first place)</p>
<p>『That’s how it works』</p>
<p>But I knew that very well.</p>
<p>(I’ve done research on why the Divine Punishment would lower if the poison user didn’t forgive me. Well, I was just realizing that the Gods were not involved in a war between people)</p>
<p>Seliadot didn’t dare to speak up, but maybe he also thought about using the power of the Evil God Fragment?</p>
<p>The other party was a terrifyingly strong poison user and an organization with a large number of illegal slaves. It was too powerful to fight alone. But wouldn’t they have given up when they realized that they would be punished by the Gods if they used the Evil God Fragments alone?</p>
<p>Just my imagination, but he seemed to have been convinced that Meritte would be punished by the gods, and he must have some knowledge about that.</p>
<p>(Besides, how could it be this quick......)</p>
<p>『That’s probably because there’s a Divine Sword in front of us』</p>
<p>(What does that mean――No, a Divine Sword is given some of the power of the Gods and is a kin to them. Do you see human life through the Divine Sword?)</p>
<p>『Yeah, it seems so』</p>
<p>(So that means...... To me, you’re lucky or not......)</p>
<p>It also didn’t matter if it was just after the Beast and Insect Gods had fallen. They had all the conditions that made it easier for the Gods to appear.</p>
<p>Before Seliadot looked at her with a pale face, the ball of light flickered.</p>
<p>「Meltrite, the sinner. Your sins are illegal contact with the Evil God Fragment and your personal and one-sided use of it」</p>
<p>「――!」</p>
<p>Meritte was trying to say something in return, but she didn’t say a word. I guess she didn’t need to object, just accept the already decided guilt. Many Gods, not just the Gods, may not be interested in people. This Divine Punishment also didn’t mention the slaughter of people at all. It was probably because it was not a crime for the Gods.</p>
<p>However, Seliadot looked a little surprised.</p>
<p>(I’m not going to tell you’re guilty......)</p>
<p>『Did the other Gods not give a reason when they punish Gods?』</p>
<p>(I can only say that according to the Gods. However, in most cases, the only thing that would happen to a Naturally occurring God is that they would punish them by the Gods. There are countless stories about towns and people who were destroyed without knowing anything about them)</p>
<p>『Uwah. That’s scary.』</p>
<p>With that in mind, the ball of light in front of me gave me a solid reason, even though it was a natural God. Was it a surprisingly gentle God?</p>
<p>「However, the fact that she was not directly involved with the piece of the Evil God, but indirectly through another person. Also, the exchange of power using the divine vessel can be considered to have entered into a contract. Therefore, the offense will be treated as a punishment for you individuals」</p>
<p>This was clearly telling us about Seliadot, wasn’t it? She must have been a Goddess who could sense us.</p>
<p>Seliadot is so relieved that it makes me wonder if it might collapse. No wonder, since the future of the lorelei was protected.</p>
<p>「You keep hunting antidemons on this continent. Until the day the pieces of the Evil Gods from Gordicia are released.」</p>
<p>The moment the God said this, Meritte’s body shone brightly.</p>
<p>「This makes you the same body as the sinner Trismegistus. We will continue to atone for you in this invincible prison.」</p>
