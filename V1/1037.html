</div><h1>Chapter 1037</h1><p>The remains of the castle of Trismegistus were still piled up. However, a part of it had already begun to be repaired.</p>
<p>I could see the outer wall of the castle gradually regenerating.</p>
<p>This method of regeneration was rather unique. Fran was staring at it with interest.</p>
<p>It wasn’t rising little by little like my regeneration skills, nor was the rubble returning to its original state like it could be regenerated in reverse.</p>
<p>First, a translucent wall was projected into the air, as if it were a holog map. Then, we could imagine that the hologma emitted a strong light, and in the next moment, the wall had acquired its substance.</p>
<p>Phobos emerged from the regenerated wall again, and the walls piled up one after another to resurrect. Even for me, this was a very strange sight.</p>
<p>「Hmm? Something’s glowing over there」</p>
<p>「He’s around where the throne is?」</p>
<p>I could see the light rising from the center of the pile of rubble. Like Isario said, it was probably the place where the throne room used to be.</p>
<p>We decided to head there for now.</p>
<p>As we climbed over the pile of rubble, I occasionally moved the rubble out of it and piled it up to serve as a foothold for our destination.</p>
<p>After about ten minutes of climbing the rubble, the scenery in front of us changed completely.</p>
<p>In the middle of the pile of rubble, there was a large space. It looked like a bowl, and looked like a crater.</p>
<p>An unharmed throne sat in the middle of it. Naturally, there was also the figure of the Lord who should be sitting on it.</p>
<p>As we looked down from the rubble of the mountain, we immediately looked away without interest.</p>
<p>There were no ceilings or walls, only the throne and the ground on which it was placed. The only thing that surrounded us was the remains of the castle.</p>
<p>It was so pitiful that I matched Trismegistus perfectly. I felt a strange feeling of unity, as if I had embodied the essence of this dragonkin.</p>
<p>A tall king sits in the middle of the remnants of the castle.</p>
<p>「...I’m sorry」</p>
<p>「I’ll be careful not to do anything like that」</p>
<p>Both Isario and Jayne must have felt close to me, looking down at Trismegistus with a complicated look on their faces.</p>
<p>We passed down a pile of rubble and approached Trismegistus.</p>
<p>「Isario, Fran, Jayne. What do you want?」</p>
<p>「Well, you’ve gotta check things out after all」</p>
<p>「Alright. I’ll answer your question.」</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, she was as inhuman as ever.</p>
<p>But I also felt a terrifying sense of emptiness in it.</p>
<p>This was the same atmosphere as before.</p>
<p>Her voice and expression looked like a machine, without the warmth of a human being. In fact, I had never seen this man shaken, and I thought that his heart had worn out during his long life.</p>
<p>But now that we’ve seen Trismegistus, we can tell that he used to be better than Jean. What we were watching was a dragonkin whose spirit had worn off and became like a machine.</p>
<p>But what we were right in front of us was a real doll. It looked like a fresh golem made from the flesh of a living being. It was as if we were right in front of it.</p>
<p>A puppet made from dragonkin’s flesh. There was no heart in it, only a mechanical response. That was what it seemed to me, but I understood.</p>
<p>Was it possible for a person to sense such emptiness?</p>
<p>Fran was not the only one. Everyone who came here felt an indescribable sense of uneasiness and fear that stopped them. Even Isario was holding his breath.</p>
<p>『That sword...』</p>
<p>(Juanaverta?)</p>
<p>『No. They look alike, but that’s all.』</p>
<p>At Trismegistus’ side, there was a silver Falcion. But it was different. I didn’t feel any presence, no power, no strange human presence. The sword had no heart.</p>
<p>Trismegistus must have noticed Fran’s strong gaze too.</p>
<p>「This is the perfect form of an Intelligence Weapon. Never utter unnecessary words or take unnecessary actions. It is a true Intelligence Weapon, perfect for rationality and convenience」</p>
<p>「You still think it’s okay to lose Juanaverta?」</p>
<p>Fran was concerned about something else.</p>
<p>(...I’m not.)</p>
<p>『Fran?』</p>
<p>(That’s not the perfect form of an intelligence weapon! You shouldn’t!)</p>
<p>Fran turned her head down and repeated the words of denial in her mind. Well, if I affirm Trismegistus’ words, I’m not that perfect. I wonder if I could accept it.</p>
<p>(Master is great not because of his strength. It’s great because he can talk. It’s fun because he can talk. It’s reassuring that he can talk. That’s not something amazing)</p>
<p>『Fran...』</p>
<p>It was a veto reaction that even made me hate him.</p>
<p>Maybe she had imagined what it would look like for me to become a sword. And she must have had a negative emotion that she couldn’t control over the sword, which reminded me of that image.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t want to mention it. He probably knew that telling Trismegistus was useless. Instead, he asked something else.</p>
<p>「I heard that Juanaverta hadn’t gone crazy for a long time. But why?」</p>
<p>「......I had a skill to not go crazy.」</p>
<p>Unusually for this man, he had a moment. His golden eyes turned to Falcion of Silver, and he narrowed slightly.</p>
<p>However, Trismegistus immediately replied with the same attitude as before.</p>
<p>「Skill?」</p>
<p>「Indeed. An Extra Skill called 『Permanent Loyalty』. It is a skill that determines a user and swears to follow them for good. In a sense, you can even say that it enslaves itself. In exchange, as long as the user exists, it can be a permanent invincible existence」</p>
<p>Does that mean that she can be immortal as long as the Lord is alive? And it doesn’t matter how old her mind is?</p>
<p>「You had that skill, but you still lost the source of your jealousy?」</p>
<p>「No. Instead of getting the original sin of jealousy, he was deprived of his eternal loyalty」</p>
<p>Aah, I see! That’s why I easily lost to the source of my jealousy and ended up like this.</p>
<p>「......Who took that skill?」</p>
<p>Fran pondered a little and asked. She didn’t want me to be like Fran’s slave with that skill, but she didn’t want me to be a sword. She just wanted to get a clue.</p>
<p>「I don’t know his name, but he was a Divine Swordsman」</p>
