</div><h1>Chapter 1041</h1><p>「Fran, it looks like you’re worried」</p>
<p>「Auntie!」</p>
<p>It was Nadia, who woke up on the bed, who greeted Fran.</p>
<p>「Oi oi, you’re sick now. Don’t be too upset」</p>
<p>「I’m sorry」</p>
<p>「Ahaha! That’s a joke! Come on, come on!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Even when Fran hugged him a little harder, he smiled without wavering. It seemed that he was physically recovered.</p>
<p>There was still some fatigue on his face though.</p>
<p>「Looks like it was a tough time」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Nadia stroked Fran’s hair with gentle hands. Fran also submitted herself to her with a look of relief.</p>
<p>After checking each other’s safety for a while, Nadia asked several questions. She had heard that there was a big antidemon, but she didn’t know the details of the incident.</p>
<p>「......Auntie. I want you to ask me something.」</p>
<p>「What is it?」</p>
<p>「About the Silver Lady」</p>
<p>「......Let’s ask them.」</p>
<p>I don’t know how Nadia felt about the Silver Lady. It must be a complicated and difficult to describe.</p>
<p>That’s why Fran decided that she had to tell Nadia about her last days. This time she needed to sort out her feelings.</p>
<p>「The Silver Lady has joined up with Master」</p>
<p>「Hmm?」</p>
<p>However, it was just like Fran as usual.</p>
<p>『Fran, you don’t know that. I’ll explain it to you. I know better』</p>
<p>「I leave it to Master」</p>
<p>「Nn. Master please」</p>
<p>I explained to her that the Silver Lady had appeared on the battlefield and had been assimilated and absorbed by me. She also explained that her true name was the bearer of hope and that she had entrusted her power to me at her own will.</p>
<p>Nadia’s expression was indescribable when she heard the name of the bearer of hope. It was not that she was angry or sad. It was just a sad expression on her face.</p>
<p>「......I see. So, you were able to sleep, huh? If so, this was a good ending.」</p>
<p>『Sorry about something』</p>
<p>「Why would Master apologize? That woman is my savior. I have no mercy for her, as I wonder why she would carry Overgrowth like that and hurt me everywhere I go.」</p>
<p>The bearer of hope had a slight emotion. There was no way she didn’t think anything of it after carrying the failed divine sword that would kill any wielder one day. I could understand that only because I was assimilated into the bearer of hope.</p>
<p>Sensing this, Nadia seemed to be worried about the fate of her hopeful bearer.</p>
<p>The bearer of hope had doubts about her mission. What she was doing was really carrying hope? Was it not just making many people unhappy?</p>
<p>And we had that kind of struggle at the time.</p>
<p>But that didn’t turn out to be the case. The Silver Lady was certainly a bearer of hope for successive generations of Overgrowth’s wielders.</p>
<p>The bearer of hope vanished with peace of mind, completely entrusting everything to me. The end result was probably a little better than Nadia had imagined.</p>
<p>He smiled in relief.</p>
<p>Nadia’s hand reached me. As I watched over her without saying a word, she gently touched my guard and started stroking it lightly. Her hand was gentle and I could feel her compassion for me.</p>
<p>「......Thank you very much.」</p>
<p>Even though his words were pointed at me, it was not a word for me.</p>
<p>Nadia had been caressing me for a while, but she soon got back in shape. Her face turned a little red, perhaps embarrassed to see the sinking air.</p>
<p>「Don’t talk about anything too humid, and let me know what kind of adventure Fran has gone on since then」</p>
<p>「Nn! Okay!」</p>
<p>At Nadia’s urging, Fran started telling the story of how she protected Castel and what happened after by using a lot of gestures.</p>
<p>「Antidemons, dragonkin, divine swords.」</p>
<p>In Sendia, Georg, Meritte, and many other schemes and schemes intertwined to save her from being sacrificed by the Divine Sword and Song.</p>
<p>In the middle of the continent, we fought a series of giant antidemons, defeated them with the help of divine swords, and finally encountered a scene where Divine Punishment was imposed.</p>
<p>How should I put it, it was quite an eventful time.</p>
<p>What Nadia ate the most was the story of a Divine Sword. She was also interested in the Divine Sword because she used the failed Divine Sword.</p>
<p>They asked me a lot of questions.</p>
<p>「Which sword do you want to know?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, about Ignis.」</p>
<p>「Have you ever seen Isario’s sword?」</p>
<p>「I’ve seen him in the form of a normal sword, but I’ve even seen him in the distance when he was getting serious. I know that he’s seen him up close in ancient times, but it was full of times, and I only remember that he turned my enemy into ashes」</p>
<p>Even though Isario was here on this continent, he didn’t use his Divine Sword often. Besides, he should often use it alone so as not to get people caught up in it. This time was special.</p>
<p>「Ignis is super amazing! Super amazing!」</p>
<p>「I know you’re dealing with fire, you know?」</p>
<p>「Nn! But the sword is also covered with flames! When you hold it, it will all turn into flames! It looks very hot!」</p>
<p>「Aah, does that mean the sword itself will become fire?」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>It was because she was more excited than usual that Fran’s words became vague. In the first place, Fran felt a little younger than her age because of her lack of connection to people, but now she felt a little younger than her.</p>
<p>Still, Nadia continued to listen to Fran with great determination, and sometimes asked questions to try to understand her.</p>
<p>She could tell that she was also enjoying the conversation with Fran. Urushi also read the air and slept in the shadows.</p>
<p>「Isario shouted. Flame prison!」</p>
<p>「Hohou―」</p>
<p>「A big antidemon is thugs!」</p>
