</div><h1>Chapter 1114</h1><p>She rushed over to Klimut, who had fallen down, and saw a large amount of blood flowing from his right eye. His eyeballs had complicated emblems that looked like magic circles. Healing magic couldn’t heal them even after it was applied. It was not like an easy-to-heal wound caused by evil spirits. It seemed that Klimut’s body didn’t seem to recognize the abnormal state of his eyeballs. When I appraised Klimut, his condition was normal. </p>
<p>「This eye can’t be healed by magic, you know...」</p>
<p> In a contract with a normal spirit, they were equals with the help of magic power. But it seemed that it was not so simple for a large spirit. However, it seemed that it was not going to be so simple for a large spirit.  Until now, it was like a temporary contract by forcibly restraining a raging spirit. That was why they wouldn’t listen when they summoned it, and Klimut was under a great burden. It seemed that they changed it to a normal contract, but they couldn’t even wish for an equal relationship with a great spirit.  So, they managed to conclude a contract by giving him their right eye.  </p>
<p>「Klimut, are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Kinda...This eye is a sign of a contract with the great spirit」</p>
<p>  Klimut muttered and smiled happily.  It didn’t seem like he was pessimistic to him.  Besides, the change to a decent contract has returned Klimut’s status to normal. In fact, some of it had been strengthened by the blessing of the spirits. Indeed, when I appraised him to check his condition, I was surprised by his tremendous status.Certainly, when I appraised it to check its status, I was surprised at its tremendous status.He had the blessings of the Unique Skill “Great Spirit”, the title of Guild Master of Magic Control, the guardian god of Alessa, an earth magician, the staff of the Great Spirit’s friend equipment, the staff of the Elf of the Elf Goddess, the cloak of the Doppelganger, the cloak of the Young Wind Dragon Wing, the shoes of a moon rabbit, and the bracelet of a corpse.  It seemed that she was able to use Spirit Magic just like before, and in exchange, she had acquired a powerful power. Moreover, she was also connected to the Great Spirit, which could even become an object of worship for the Elf. It seemed that it would be cheaper for a spirit caster to make a contract with the Great Spirit with only her right eye.  When she noticed, the blood from Klimut’s right eye had stopped flowing.  The wound on his eyeball was also blocked. However, he seemed to have lost his eyesight.  I was worried, but Klimut looked much better than before.  Klimut stopped Fran from going to rescue the survivors, thinking that this would be a relief. </p>
<p>「Fran-san, you’re okay with that sword, are you?」</p>
<p> His use of such evil energy must have made him realize that it was not a normal sword.  </p>
<p>「Nn.  Don’t worry」</p>
<p>「... That’s fine then」</p>
<p>  He didn’t seem to be convinced, but he seemed to have believed Fran’s words. When I gave Fran another instruction to save them, they started to use spirit magic themselves.  </p>
<p>『Let’s call Urushi for now』</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
<p> As I handed over the captives to Urushi and the others, Fran asked them a question about the mysterious object that had flowed out of the great spirit. It was because she didn’t know if she should recover it or not.  However, Klimut didn’t know much about that either. When he was summoned in the past, there was a high possibility that it was a magic tool or something that was used in the ritual.  We were asked to retrieve it since the Great Spirit seemed to be concerned about it, but we headed in the direction where it fell.  Then we caught a suspicious presence.  The faint magic power was moving in a straight line toward the north.  It was too suspicious.  As we eliminated our presence and followed it from the sky, we saw an undead running on the earth. He was holding something thin in his hand.  </p>
<p>(Hydman)</p>
<p>『I knew it, it really was still there!』</p>
<p>  It seemed that Hydman had retrieved it before us.  However, because of this, it had been discovered by us. Even though he had been able to erase his presence, he hadn’t been able to erase the magic power of the mysterious object in his hand.  After observing it from the sky for a while, he seemed to be trying to put the mysterious stick in an item bag. However, he seemed to be unable to finish it off.  Was it a special magic tool that didn’t fit into an item bag? Well, it was probably something inside the great spirit, and it might have some secret power.  The fact that Hydman was trying to retrieve it in the first place showed its uniqueness. If we didn’t do something about Klimut, there was even a possibility that that that the mysterious stick was his ultimate goal.  </p>
<p>(Let’s take it down and get the stick back)</p>
<p>『Yeah』</p>
<p>  I’d like to know where he was going by letting him swim, but this would make him go to Raydoss. Besides, Klimut alone would not be enough to help us in the town’s rescue.  Fran had also thought that far ahead and decided to defeat the Highdman here.  They hadn’t noticed us yet, and their combat power was still low. They won the battle with a slash from teleportation. Hydman collapsed with his legs cut off.  </p>
<p>「G-Girl...!」</p>
<p>「Did you come here for this purpose?」</p>
<p>「Hmph?  What are you talking about?  I don’t know.  I failed to kill the spirit user, so I was just thinking of recovering this at least」</p>
<p>「Klimut’s assassination wasn’t coming with it?」</p>
<p>「No!  No further talk is needed!」</p>
<p>  He defeated it because he was about to activate the self-destruction system, but the Principle of Falsehood has taught him many things, you know?  Apparently, Hydman had been aiming for this stick-like sword from the beginning. He was sure that it would be retrieved by us, so he must have tried to slip the false information before the self-destruction.  He appraised the mysterious stick lying on the ground and displayed it as an old stick sword.  A stick sword is a sword-like stick without a blade. At first glance, it looked like a thin sword in a sheathe, but in fact, it did not have a blade itself.  Moreover, it had almost no decorations, and it was an appearance focused on practicality.  The rod part could only be called a metal cylinder.  It had an attack power of 100 and conductivity of D.  It had some hardening and repair skills, so there was no doubt that it was sturdy... However, something was wrong.  It had hit us with its all-out thrust, wasn’t it?  Even if it didn’t land a direct hit, if it had been repelled by that momentum, it would have been a considerable impact. Moreover, it had fallen into the ground with a great deal of force.  There was no way a weapon this weak could be left unscathed. In other words, it would be strange if it hadn’t been shattered at a level where it couldn’t be repaired.  Or, was it raising its Hardening and Repair abilities even at the expense of its performance?  Moreover, it did not go into dimensional storage. It was generated with a backlash and could not be stored no matter how I looked at it.  Was it that the actual performance was not balanced with the information displayed and the power I could feel?</p>
<p>『You’re right』</p>
