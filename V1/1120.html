</div><h1>Chapter 1120</h1><p>The brave warriors made a lot of noise, but the uninhabited civilians beside them did not end there. Some of them fell asleep after pausing to keep watch, others began to enjoy their drinks, and even managed to get rid of them by themselves.</p>
<p>Fran had been completely underestimated. Perhaps the reason was that she hadn’t suffered any direct damage so far, so she had allowed Fran to do whatever she wanted.</p>
<p>However, our unapproved use of supplies was not good. In fact, bringing out food has touched Fran’s upside down. After all, one of the reasons for the request was to deliver food to everyone fighting in the front line.</p>
<p>「Here, come」</p>
<p>Fran called out to the men surrounding the fire. Her voice was quiet, but she must have heard it.</p>
<p>But she ignored them completely. They just underestimated her.</p>
<p>「Oi!」</p>
<p>「Huh? What the hell――!」</p>
<p>「W-What are yo―Ugh!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Seeing the men’s annoying faces, he no longer wanted to question them.</p>
<p>Fran’s expression disappeared, but she punched the man in the face and blown him away. And she didn’t end there. She then beat the men to pieces just in time, just in time to not lose consciousness.</p>
<p>The other valiant soldiers, who had been watching with a thin smile on their faces, began to show their fear as their faces were transformed and the sound of their limbs cracked.</p>
<p>Still, that didn’t stop Fran’s fist. She probably punched 30 shots at a time, changing the opponent she punched moderately so that the three of them could not escape.</p>
<p>After the sanctions were lifted, there were pathetic adventurers crying, spitting gastric juices and blood out of their bodies with broken bones all over their bodies.</p>
<p>It may look like a bit too much, but I think we need to do this as a pretense against the other warriors. Fran went that far――.</p>
<p>(She went way too far.)</p>
<p>『Wha, Fran-san?』</p>
<p>Because of all the frustration I’ve built up, I made the wrong decision to stop her! She had a strangely refreshing look on her face! Well, I’m not sorry about that now!</p>
<p>『I-Just heal him for now!』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Heal the misconstrued soldiers with magic. After confirming that all the wounds were healed, Fran shouted out.</p>
<p>「......Everyone. I’ll line up there.」</p>
<p>It seems that Fran’s actions, which destroyed the three of them, had a considerable impact on the comrades-in-arms.</p>
<p>I don’t think she had seen Fran’s interrogation before, but if she could heal so many wounds in an instant, even worse sanctions would be placed on her......? Everyone seemed to agree.</p>
<p>Most of the warriors in-laws had started moving as they were told. However, some of the others had no choice but to complain under any circumstances.</p>
<p>「W-What are you talking about... Gyahaah!」</p>
<p>A large man over two meters tall was about to pack into Fran――but he was blown away about ten meters. His metal armor was hollow.</p>
<p>Seeing Fran, who had just unleashed her recovery magic, must have understood how overwhelming her power was. Fran then told her not to be underestimated, “Stand up and line up”.</p>
<p>This time the great man stood up immediately and straightened up, without complaining at all. His body was trembling pitifully. I guess it was because of his fear and the pain that still remained.</p>
<p>Seeing as how badly they had been hit, the warriors hurriedly lined up in front of Fran.</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>Fran continued to glare silently in front of the blue-faced warriors.</p>
<p>(Master, what should we do with these guys?)</p>
<p>『Eh? Did they just line up without thinking about anything?』</p>
<p>(Nn. I just lined up for the time being)</p>
<p>Apparently, she ordered them to line up with anger, but she didn’t seem to be thinking of what to do next.</p>
<p>Fran remained silent the entire time, and to the men, she must have been silent because of her anger. She was shocked, holding her breath and waiting.</p>
<p>I-I guess we can just stay like this for a while.</p>
<p>『What do you want to do?』</p>
<p>(I don’t want to do anything rash.)</p>
<p>『It was a good lesson for us, so why don’t we just wait and see for a while?』</p>
<p>(But it would be useless if we take them with us. We would cause trouble if they do whatever we want on the battlefield after all)</p>
<p>『O-ooh, maybe that’s true.』</p>
<p>(Don’t take anyone who might bother everyone)</p>
<p>I never thought that Fran was thinking that hard! In the past, she would have only been torn apart and listened to what she had to say right now. But I never thought that it would only anger her, but she was thinking about what the future was going to be like!</p>
<p>I was so touched!</p>
<p>『So you’re saying you want them to work seriously rather than leave them to themselves? And not just now, but forever』</p>
<p>(Nn. Can you?)</p>
<p>『U-umm?』</p>
<p>If they showed any power relations, they would probably become quieter now, but I guess they would do the same thing to anyone but Fran...</p>
<p>Did she break her heart in a mock battle? No, that wouldn’t be a bad idea. It’ll take a while after all...</p>
<p>A way to regenerate and calm the bad guys while moving.</p>
<p>(Master?)</p>
<p>I knew it was powerful, but to think it was a failed divine sword!</p>
<p>(Training......)</p>
<p>『T-No, I’m not! I just made a mistake! Regeneration! Regeneration!』</p>
<p>(I see.)</p>
<p>Fran nodded lightly before thinking in silence. Eh? You really don’t want to train, do you?</p>
