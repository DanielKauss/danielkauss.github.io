</div><h1>Chapter 933</h1><p>Five days have passed since Fran woke up.</p>
<p>I wanted to rest here slowly until my muscle pain was fully healed, but the people around me didn’t leave Fran alone.</p>
<p>Mea, who had been here since this morning, brought us a story. We’ve seen her every day, but she looks serious today.</p>
<p>「Fran, I have a favor to ask you」</p>
<p>「What is it?」</p>
<p>「......Are you sure? I haven’t had anything to say yet, okay?」</p>
<p>「At Mea’s request, I’ll ask her if it’s not impossible. She nodded first」</p>
<p>「Fuhahaha! As expected of my friend! It’s not that reckless. It’s not like I always talk recklessly!」</p>
<p>Mea smiled as she looked to Urushi, who was next to Fran.</p>
<p>「It might be easier to ask for Urushi’s assistance than Fran. I would also like to have him give a message to Nocta too」</p>
<p>「Woof?」</p>
<p>『Announcer? Is a magic tool no good enough?』</p>
<p>「The commotion destroyed the guild, the Dragon King Syndicate, and all the magic tools in the tower. The Dragon King must have been after that too, so we can only get in touch with him by messenger.」</p>
<p>Mea, Sophie, and Velmeria. Other influential people from the town, such as the head of the merchant association and the head of the woman’s association, decided to appeal to the Dragon King’s actions.</p>
<p>That’s why they decided to send trusted and fast-tracked people to multiple cities as liaison agents.</p>
<p>「Lindo has finally been resurrected. I will come as a messenger to the far away.」</p>
<p>「Rhyndo, are you able to call him again?」</p>
<p>「Yes! That’s why I want to get out of this town as soon as possible」</p>
<p>『Oh, are they still pretty bad?』</p>
<p>「Rather, it got even worse with Lind’s resurrection」</p>
<p>The fact that Mea’s sword was a Divine Sword had already been widely known. It was said that more than a hundred people and thieves had attacked the Divine Sword, so it should be called a Divine Sword.</p>
<p>However, it was the dragonkin who reacted more violently. They seemed to think that the violent dragon sword, Lyndovlm, was not just a weapon, but a true figure of the Goddess.</p>
<p>Many dragonkin rushed over to Mea to show them their swords. At first, Mea and Quina used that momentum to increase the influence of the Beastmen Union, but they soon became fed up with the overly persistent dragonkin.</p>
<p>Some of them offered it to the dragonkin as a present, while others just worshiped it.</p>
<p>「Quina eliminated it though」</p>
<p>『Aah―』</p>
<p>They didn’t have any status on this continent, but she was just like a princess after all. They really couldn’t ignore her giving them the Divine Sword possessed by the royalty.</p>
<p>Could it be that their heads have been sent to some rebellious dragonkin organization......? I thought it was just a rumor, but it might be true! A fear!</p>
<p>「What’s wrong, Master?」</p>
<p>『No, it’s nothing. I was just thinking about not going against Quina』</p>
<p>「Umm, Master has finally reached that level! Hmm, let’s not go against him. I don’t know what kind of punishment he’ll give us!」</p>
<p>That Mea was glancing around while saying that. She was completely trained by Quina.</p>
<p>「Let’s leave Quina’s talk to them and get back to business. I want Fran, who has Urushi’s legs, to go to Nocta. What do you say?」</p>
<p>「Master, can I take it? I’m also worried about Auntie」</p>
<p>『Fran, you’re starting to feel some muscle pain, so you should be fine』</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>Urushi cringed as if to say, “Leave it to me”. I guess he was getting tired of living a lazy life in the tower.</p>
<p>「Then I’ll send you a letter to carry you later. I’ll ask you to leave as soon as possible」</p>
<p>「Nn. Okay」</p>
<p>『I’ll leave it to you』</p>
<p>「Also, you can do whatever you want, so as not to return to Sendia. There will be almost no antidemons in this area, and it will be boring for Fran.」</p>
<p>「Okay」</p>
<p>「I can’t lose if I move...... Just blow away the antidemons to my heart’s content.」</p>
<p>「Nn! I’ll leave it to you!」</p>
<p>From then on, it was quick.</p>
<p>In less than an hour, Mea returned with a bruise on her forehead that looked like the remains of an Iron Claw, and she handed her several letters. It seemed that she had somehow been punished by Quina.</p>
<p>Fran complimented the soup stall yesterday, and it seems that their customers have increased, so they gave us some soup for free.</p>
<p>「Let’s go」</p>
<p>「You’re a good Space-time Magic-user huh? You can move quickly after all」</p>
<p>「Fufun. It’s convenient」</p>
<p>「Fran, Master, and Urushi. I’m counting on you!」</p>
<p>A whole day then.</p>
<p>As we were riding on Urushi’s back on our way to Nocta, we saw a huge, familiar city wall.</p>
<p>「I can see Nocta.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>『It’s the same as before.』</p>
<p>Sendia was also attacked by such a horde. Nocta, on the other hand... I had my doubts about it, but the place was nothing different from before.</p>
<p>They seemed to have bounced back the antidemons spectacularly. Adventurers and soldiers were dozens of times more powerful than Sendia, so it was no surprise.</p>
<p>Once inside, it was as crowded as it used to be. No, maybe there were even more people inside than before?</p>
<p>Obviously, the number of people walking down the road was increasing. It seems that refugees from illegal villages like Castel and a large number of adventurers who are planning to stay here have come into the city.</p>
<p>Besides, we could also see dwarves and demonkin here. Maybe they heard that their queen was in this city and decided to gather here.</p>
<p>There was no atmosphere of the town after the war. Could it be that Nocta was not attacked?</p>
<p>We headed for the Adventurers Guild, observing our surroundings. There, we met a familiar face.</p>
<p>「Sis!」</p>
<p>「Diggins.」</p>
<p>The one who looked happy as he ran toward us was Diggins, the Rank B adventurer of the bearkin. He was also a friend of ours who had fought with us and had lost his lifeline at Castel.</p>
<p>I could see that Fran was happy to meet Diggins again. He was treating her as a comrade-in-arms, I guess.</p>
<p>「You remained in Nocta?」</p>
<p>「Now that you’ve been asked to tell me about Nadia-san, I have to throw her away on the way in!」</p>
<p>To my surprise, they remained in Nocta to protect Nadia.</p>
<p>「Antidemons in Nocta, were you okay?」</p>
<p>「We managed to get through the raid once, but everyone was fine! However, during the antidemon season, the distribution of antidemons was strangely strange. I mean, there are very few attacks on Nocta......」</p>
<p>Apparently, the Dragon King’s men were even guiding the antidemons around Nocta to Sendia. That would be enough.</p>
<p>「What about Auntie?」</p>
<p>「Nadia-san hasn’t woken up yet」</p>
<p>「I see...」</p>
<p>「Now, let’s head to Mulsani’s husband’s mansion.」</p>
<p>(Master, can I go with Auntie first?)</p>
<p>『Yeah, I want to know her condition too. Let’s go』</p>
<p>「Nn. Thanks for Diggins」</p>
<p>「We’ll meet up at the Adventurers Guild again!」</p>
