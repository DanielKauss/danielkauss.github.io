</div><h1>Chapter 1069</h1><p>A blonde boy and girl were discussing something with serious faces in the center of the plaza. They were Fran’s friends, prince Fran, and Princess Satia. It was clear that the demon knight belonged to the Kingdom of Philias. In the corner of the plaza, there was a pile of corpses that seemed to be soldiers of the Kingdom of Raidos. I think Fran and her friends eliminated the soldiers of Raidos and regained this village... The only problem was why the demon knights tried to excommunicate us. The only problem was why the demon knights tried to excommunicate us. If Philias were in cahoots with the Kingdom of Kranzel, I wouldn’t understand why they had killed Fran, who called herself an adventurer.If Philias were in cahoots with the Kingdom of Kranzel, I would not understand why they wanted to kill Fran, who called herself an adventurer.  However, if Philias were to effectively control this village and turn it into their own territory, they might be attacked.  </p>
<p>『Fran.  Don’t leave yet, okay?』</p>
<p>  The main problem was how to confirm their will.  And what should we do if they are our enemies? In particular, if they ever confront us, will Fran be able to fight against Fran and her friends?  In the first place, do we need to fight them? Fran, an adventurer, was not directly employed by the Kranzel Kingdom, and she was in a position to not have to fight against Fran and her friends.  Well, they will not be able to stay in Kranzel anymore, so we’ll need to move our base to the Beast Kingdom. But to begin with, she doesn’t have to be involved in a war, and that’s all that matters.  As I was thinking about what to do next, Fran’s body shivered. I soon realized why.  </p>
<p>『Is that a demon?』</p>
<p>(Both seem to be strong.)</p>
<p>『At the very least, they’re the strongest demons I’ve ever seen.』</p>
<p>  Behind Fran and Satia, someone with a huge humanoid appeared. It was clearly a demon.  Behind Fran is a man-type about five meters tall with dragon-like wings.  He looked much more human than the demons we’ve seen before.  His skin was brown and his hair was white. He was carrying a huge black scythe.  Behind Satia, a female-type demon about five meters tall.Behind Satia appeared a female-shaped demon about five meters tall.  It didn’t have a weapon, but its long hair wriggled like it had a will of its own, and purple smoke was flowing from the corners of its mouth.  Both of them had brown skin and gray hair, and their eyes were covered tightly with a black leather eye patch, so they could not be detected.  The leather equipment that protected vital spots was also designed to be very similar. There was no doubt that the two demons were the same kind.  The only problem was what they would do if they called out such powerful demons――  </p>
<p>「... I’m sorry, but it’s for our people」</p>
<p>「I’m sorry」</p>
<p>  Frut and Satia bowed their heads to the villagers as they apologized. The look on their faces was just like depression.  Wasn’t this really bad? Fran felt a disturbing presence and ignored the voices of the villagers as they began to voice their concerns, and made a declaration.  </p>
<p>「First, it’s their bandits.  Kill them.  Pune!」</p>
<p>「You can rest assured, Ronowe.」</p>
<p>「Wooooof!」</p>
<p>  The dragon-wing demon bune obeyed his orders and wiped out the scythe.  The neck of the bandits at his feet fell with blood spurting from the cut section.  Ronowe’s attacks were even more shocking.  What was more was that when his arms split as if they exploded, they became countless tentacles that attacked the bandits. The thick tentacles easily shattered the human skull and took their lives. The villagers tried to escape with screams, but their limbs were restrained and unable to move at all.  It all happened in a blink of an eye.  What on earth is Fran and Satya doing!? </p>
<p>「Next up, Bweh!」</p>
<p>「Woooof!」</p>
<p>  Amidst my confusion, Fran jumped out without hesitation.  </p>
<p>「I won’t let you go!」</p>
<p>  She ran at a super godspeed and knocked off the first blow that Bweh had swung towards the child. In addition, Fran’s kick landed a direct hit on Fran’s chest plate, as she avoided the second blow she swung down towards her.  Even the giant demon must have been able to withstand its blow. They were blown several meters away, forcing her to retreat. However, it was not the demon that Fran was watching.  </p>
<p>「Frut!  Satia!」</p>
<p>「F-Fran...」</p>
<p>「Fran-san. Why, why are you here......?」</p>
<p>  The worst reunion they had ever seen.  A clearly worried expression appeared on the face of the prince and princess.  </p>
<p>「Why are you here?  Besides, why have you done this!?」</p>
<p>「...It’s for the kingdom’s sake.」</p>
<p>「I’m sorry.」</p>
<p>  The demonkin stopped moving, probably because of the disturbance in Fran and Satia.  Was killing the villagers for the kingdom’s sake? Was it even necessary to put the royalty into this fight? There were many people trapped in the square, but it looked like ordinary people.  After closer inspection, I could see that there was something left in the area where Fran and Satia were standing.  It seemed to be a large magic stone. I can’t tell from the appraisal that it was a magic stone...  I was eager to hear more, but a bother interrupted us.  </p>
<p>「Both of you!  I don’t have time to talk to you anymore!」</p>
<p>「B-but...」</p>
<p>「Fran-san is my savior!」</p>
<p>  The elderly demon knight scolded Fran and Urushi. As the prince tried to say something back, the demon knight continued his words.  </p>
<p>「You will abandon the people!  You must fulfill your royal duty!  This village will be destroyed anyway! In that case, the entire country must protect it!」</p>
<p>「!」</p>
<p>「......」</p>
<p>  The power returned to Fran and Satia’s faces.</p>
<p>「B-But......」</p>
<p>「Fran-san, you are my savior!」</p>
<p> The demon knights of his age scolded Fran and Urushi. As the prince tried to say something back, the demon knights continued their words. </p>
<p>「You will abandon the people! You will be obliged to be royalty! This village will be destroyed anyway! In that case, only our country must protect it!」</p>
<p>「!」</p>
<p>「......」</p>
<p> The power returned to Fran and Satia’s faces. They looked like they had made up their minds in a bad way.</p>
