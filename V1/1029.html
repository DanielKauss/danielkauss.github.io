</div><h1>Chapter 1029</h1><p>「Leave the rest to me」</p>
<p>「Nn...」</p>
<p>「It’s bad for me to get some good things」</p>
<p>「Isario, are you okay?」</p>
<p>「What the hell, the girls were able to weaken it. My uncle has to do his best too」</p>
<p>The reason why Fran’s expression was clouded over was because she was worried about Isario. His presence was clearly weak.</p>
<p>She continued to release her divine sword, which lowered her level even further. The backlash and exhaustion from the series of fierce battles must have been tremendous.</p>
<p>Isario must have known his limit, but he laughed away with a confident expression on his face. It was as if he was trying not to worry about Fran.</p>
<p>「Hey young miss, can you move? Get as far away from me as possible.」</p>
<p>「Nn...」</p>
<p>『Don’t worry. I’ll take Fran and Sophie with me.』</p>
<p>「I’m counting on you」</p>
<p>『......I’ll be counting on you.』</p>
<p>「Yeah」</p>
<p>Isario waved his hand and ran toward the giant antidemon. The fact that it was not very fast was probably giving us a chance to leave.</p>
<p>『Let’s get out of here!』</p>
<p>「Nn...」</p>
<p>I picked up Fran and Sophie, who were unable to move, with my telekinesis and moved as far away from them as possible.</p>
<p>We need to reduce Isario’s burden as much as possible. The other group members have also started to move. It would be quick if Urushi helped, but they couldn’t come out of the shadows yet.</p>
<p>I guess she must have put all her magic power into that one blow. Thanks to my cannibalism, my magic power had recovered a lot, so I could still move, but I might have been in danger if it hadn’t been for that.</p>
<p>As I was desperately away from them, I could feel the Divine Power moving behind us.</p>
<p>It was already more than 100 meters away, but I could feel the tremendous heat that Ignis was emitting.</p>
<p>The heat coming from Ignis created a kind of divine flame, which made the surroundings look distorted. Moreover, Isario’s body was burned, and smoke was billowing around him.</p>
<p>The flames swirling around Ignis must be so dense that even Isario could not control them.</p>
<p>As Isario swung Ignis, the flames danced around us. It was a beautiful sight, but the flames that touched the ground melted the earth and made a buzz. It was like a hellish pot.</p>
<p>Isario was clad in divine flames, but she must have been agitated by that sense of urgency. The giant antidemons wriggled wildly. What was unleashing were intense evil spirits.</p>
<p>Rather than an antidemon, it had an evil spirit so dense that it looked like a piece of the Evil God. Then, its body was transformed into a burst.</p>
<p>Dozens of tentacles were created and stretched toward Isario. I couldn’t help but wonder if they still had the power to make such a movement.</p>
<p>Against such an evil-looking antidemon, Isario calmly activated his technique.</p>
<p>「 Divine Sword Art, ‘Flaming Jail’」</p>
<p>What Ignis swung down was a small ball of fire. It looked like an unsuccessful Fire Ball.</p>
<p>But that didn’t seem to be the case. Right after the red ball flew in a straight line and collided with the giant antidemon――.</p>
<p>BOOOOOOOOOM!</p>
<p>A pillar of thick flames stood out from the place where the giant antidemons stood. The bright red flames rose in a straight line, as if it was about to pierce the sky.</p>
<p>Just as the tentacles of the giant antidemons wriggled wildly within the pillar of flame, it quickly burned out and disappeared.</p>
<p>Thanks to the control of Isario, we were only in a place where we could be at a temperature of about a Sacramento. However, the amount of heat trapped inside the pillar of fire would have exceeded our imagination. As the name of the technique implied, it was a hell of fire.</p>
<p>The excess energy leaking out into the surrounding area was enough to create a storm-like wind.</p>
<p>Just after this lasted for a few seconds, a sudden roar and shockwave disappeared. And at the same time, the pillar of flame also disappeared.</p>
<p>And the giant antidemons had completely disappeared. They had been completely exterminated by Isario’s Flame Jail. Even if I tried to detect their magic power, there was no sign of them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the purple dome covering this area disappeared.</p>
<p>It was our victory.</p>
<p>「Shii, it’s over...?」</p>
<p>『Yeah! We’ve defeated that giant antidemon!』</p>
<p>Thanks to my healing magic, Fran’s condition had improved. She would not be able to fight for a while, but she was no longer in a state where she would die of exhaustion.</p>
<p>There was the backlash of using the divine attribute, but the huge increase in my magic power also put a burden on Fran. We’ll have to be careful in the future.</p>
<p>「Isa, Rhyn...」</p>
<p>『What? What! Isario!』</p>
<p>I could see the life force rapidly draining from the collapsed Isario. That was a dangerous momentum.</p>
<p>She said that she couldn’t accept the backlash of the Divine Sword because her level had dropped too low due to the price. I guess this was also the result of the longer duration of the Divine Sword’s release, which caused more backlash than usual.</p>
<p>(Master, let’s save Isario. I guess I just have to do it myself)</p>
<p>『...Okay. Urushi, I’ll leave you two to him if it comes down to it』</p>
<p>(Woof.)</p>
<p>I gently laid Fran and Sophie on the ground and flew toward Isario. Shit! Hurry up, me!</p>
<p>『Isario! I’ll definitely help you!』</p>
<p>「......Ugh.」</p>
<p>I’m already unconscious!</p>
<p>I fired a series of Greater Heals, which were imbued with Divine Power, but they didn’t work at all.</p>
<p>Does that mean I need a higher-level recovery magic now? My current healing magic was Lv.5. I had learned skills to recover from abnormal conditions and recover from a wide area attack, but I have not yet obtained a technique more specialized in healing than Greater Heal.</p>
<p>If I raised my level one or two more, I might be able to remember it... But no, Isario took good care of me. For this man, I wouldn’t regret using any self-evolution points.</p>
<p>I used self-evolution points while continuing to use healing magic, life magic, and support magic. Then, with just one healing magic raise, I could target the recovery magic we were after.</p>
<p>『Maximum Heal!』</p>
<p>I’ve healed a little! But this was no good enough! It’s better than Greater Heal, but it’s faster to lose my life force!</p>
<p>『Damn!』</p>
<p>「It’s just a sword」</p>
<p>『!』</p>
<p>Huh? I suddenly felt a presence!</p>
<p>「You think Isario is in danger, right?」</p>
<p>But at a time like this, they were really after us!</p>
<p>『Trismegistus!』</p>
