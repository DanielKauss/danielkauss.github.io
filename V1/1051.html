</div><h1>Chapter 1051</h1><p>Marl, who had turned into an ice demon, approached Fran. She went berserk, but her magic use seemed to have improved.</p>
<p>He didn’t chant any magic, and activated multiple at the same time. In addition, his physical strength and defense had also increased.</p>
<p>「Grrrrr!」</p>
<p>「Muh!」</p>
<p>『This is bad!』</p>
<p>Marle’s arm suddenly stretched out like Camellia’s tongue and approached Fran at super high speed.</p>
<p>Fran quickly dodged her arm, but the long arm immediately changed its movement. She crouched and swung like a whip, engulfing the entire area.</p>
<p>Her arms, which seemed to be made of ice, moved surprisingly supple.</p>
<p>Normally, this would have been a dangerous attack, but Fran was used to dealing with whip attacks. In the Plains of the Demon Wolf, she had long been in a mock battle with the world’s top whip users.</p>
<p>『You have my thanks to Amanda!』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>She then saw through Mordred’s intricate arms and ducked them completely.</p>
<p>However, Marl’s boldness was beyond our imagination. Just when I thought that his rampaging ice arm had unleashed strong magic power, a huge explosion then suddenly occurred.</p>
<p>From the surface of the surrounding sea, upside-down ice pillars stood as if to collide with the sky, and white mist covered the area.</p>
<p>Thanks to the barrier, we were able to prevent major damage, but her left arm was covered in freezing and the inside of her arm was probably frozen.</p>
<p>While healing me with heals, I used flame magic to melt the ice.</p>
<p>『He sacrificed his arm to attack it.』</p>
<p>(It was a close call. If Master hadn’t protected me, my whole body might have frozen)</p>
<p>『Fran, Marl――will be coming!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Marl’s presence then rushed into us. After breaking through the white wall of cold air, Marl appeared, with both of his arms firmly fixed on him.</p>
<p>She then swung down the ice greatsword in her hand toward Fran’s head.</p>
<p>「Grrr!」</p>
<p>「Shhh!」</p>
<p>He’s certainly fast and sharp, but not nearly as strong as Fran in melee combat.</p>
<p>「Seyaaah!」</p>
<p>Fran calmly handled the greatsword and slammed me into Marl’s right arm. The fire attribute sword and Marl’s ice fought against each other for just a moment, and steam overflowed.</p>
<p>It seemed that by conducting magic power to the ice covered in it, it was possible to raise its defense power pinpoint.</p>
<p>But I couldn’t stop myself now.</p>
<p>The power of the slashes slowed down slightly, but it was really only a little. I sliced through Marl’s arm as if it was easier than slashing at the tofu.</p>
<p>I could see her arms, which had been separated from her body, melting into the void as magic power.</p>
<p>(I knew it, it still grew even when I cut it!)</p>
<p>『It looked as if it had absorbed the sea water.』</p>
<p>She sucked up the surrounding sea water and instantly grew her slashed arm.</p>
<p>It seems that Marl’s body was now completely made up of ice. His face had the original human face exposed, but the ice covered part of his body might no longer be human.</p>
<p>『But, isn’t it quite hard to defeat this guy on the sea?』</p>
<p>(......Nn.)</p>
<p>She still hadn’t made up her mind yet. She never thought that Fran would be this upset...... All of them were of a similar age, same-sex, and illegal slaves. The combination of them completely overlapped with her.</p>
<p>Fran must not have thought that she would be able to save Marl now. She knew that it would be dangerous not only for her but also for the town if she had to defeat it.</p>
<p>I could feel the strength in her hand holding me as she was trying to be prepared.</p>
<p>But it seemed that she still hadn’t made up her mind to kill him. She was glaring at Marl as she clenched her teeth. It wouldn’t be difficult to win against Fran now that she had grown up, if she were to get serious. But still, Fran was unable to take a step forward.</p>
<p>I have no choice.</p>
<p>I guess we’ll have to buy some more time.</p>
<p>『Fran, why don’t you try guiding Marl to attack the other ships?』</p>
<p>(?)</p>
<p>『Probably, that barrier has the power to select what’s passable and what’s not』</p>
<p>Otherwise, they would not be able to return to the ship from the outside, and bombardment from inside might create a barrier.</p>
<p>It was very likely that it had some kind of magic formula to sort out our enemies. If so, what about Marl?</p>
<p>Being on a water dragonkin probably meant I could just pass through the barrier. Then, what if I were to lead you to the center of the fleet that was protected by the barrier in your current outburst?</p>
<p>(I see!)</p>
<p>『I think it’s worth a try』</p>
<p>(Got it!)</p>
<p>Fran made an immediate decision and flew backwards, away from Marl.</p>
<p>『Urushi! Now we’ll guide Marl to the center of the fleet! Be careful!』</p>
<p>(Woof!)</p>
<p>「Grrrrr!」</p>
<p>Right now, I just couldn’t help but think that his reason was gone. He followed Fran as she ran and charged straight at her.</p>
<p>Moreover, she unleashed her ice and snow magic.</p>
<p>They didn’t seem to care about the line of fire at all. I could see the ice bullets we dodged thrust themselves into the side of the nearby enemy ship.</p>
<p>This was not much damage for a large ship, but we could see that Marl was no longer concerned about killing each other.</p>
<p>If we could let them unleash more moves, we might cause a lot of damage to the enemy fleet.</p>
<p>『Our destination is a water dragonkin!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
