</div><h1>Chapter 957</h1><p>We captured the dragonkin and asked them about a lot of things, but we didn’t get much important information. Or rather, they just moved as ordered without being informed. Still, there were a few things we knew. </p>
<p>「So it’s the Dragon King’s order?」</p>
<p>「Nn. The northern dragonkin are my enemy.」</p>
<p>「I guess every one of the settlements is in cahoots with the Dragon King.」</p>
<p>The dragonkin we caught were not just ordinary thugs. They were apprentice warriors at the northern dragonkin settlements. They weren’t the ones who got tired of the strict training and fled, but they were officially ordered to cooperate with the Dragon King. They weren’t the ones who got sick of the strict training and fled, but they were officially ordered to cooperate with the Dragon King. </p>
<p>「But they don’t know what they’re doing.」</p>
<p> It is enough to be sure that the Dragon King is plotting to keep the area quiet.  </p>
<p>「If their story is true, it means the Dragon King is trying to block this area. I don’t know what they’re trying to do, but I’m sure they’re not rookies.」</p>
<p>「I didn’t tell you the truth.」</p>
<p>「Huh? Could it be that you have lie detection?」</p>
<p>「Intuition of the woman.」</p>
<p>「Hahaha! Sounds reliable!」</p>
<p>「What should we do?」</p>
<p>「You’re right.  I’d like to hear more details from the dragonkin who knows his circumstances.  Come to think of it, the threats from earlier were good, weren’t they? I’ll leave it to you next time too.」</p>
<p>「Nn!  I’ll leave it to you.」</p>
<p>  There were three main sources of information from the dragonkin.  The Dragon King ordered the dragonkin in the northern reservations to eliminate all intruders.  That’s because he gained immense power and was trying to become a transcendent. With that power, he took over the continent as a dragonkin and was trying to build a new Dragon King. </p>
<p>「I don’t know what the Dragon King’s goal is and Trismegistus, but I’m sure he’ll get bored, right?」</p>
<p>「Nn.  Let’s go.」</p>
<p>「Hmm, what’s he gonna do? Young lady, you’re not allowed to enter the center, right?」</p>
<p>「Emergence.」</p>
<p>「Hmm......  Well, I guess we’ll just go after the Rank S adventurer grants us permission.  She’s usually working with the guild, so she won’t use her power at times like this.」</p>
<p>「Oh! Then, can I go see Trismegistus?」</p>
<p>「Finding the Dragon King is our top priority, right?」</p>
<p>「Okay.」</p>
<p>  Somehow, we ended up entering the center of the continent without a hitch.  We should need permission from the guild anyways...... Is it okay if Isario is with us and he can add him to our roster later?  Besides, as Isario said, dealing with the Dragon King is our top priority. If we let things go, it’ll only progress that fast. Oh, and the dragonkin will be left on the spot.  Though they were enemies, I promised Isario that he wouldn’t take their lives. Besides, they weren’t involved in the slave trade.  Even though weak, they are dragonkin.  They will escape on their own soon. That’s why we were determined to find them and capture them before the Dragon King could achieve his goal, but we soon stopped.  Crack......  </p>
<p>「Did they tremble?」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>  Immediately after the sound of the earth shook, Isario stopped and muttered.  It seemed that the ground trembled. But Fran and I didn’t notice it, because it was right on Urushi. The only thing we could tell was the tremor as Urushi ran.  </p>
<p>『Urushi.  How is it?』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  Urushi nodded his head.  It seemed that the ground really trembled.  Crack! The ground roared even louder than before! </p>
<p>「It shook!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Even the girls could feel it!  What in the world is going on......? I’ve never heard of anything that is going on in Gordicia after all.」</p>
<p>  Apparently, Gordicia was a continent that did not experience an earthquake itself. So, there was no doubt that some kind of unusual situation was occurring.  It was right after that.  </p>
<p>「What?」</p>
<p>「!」</p>
<p>「Grrrr!」</p>
<p>  Fran and Urushi braced themselves at the same time. An obviously extraordinary amount of evil energy then covered the entire area at once.  At the same time, the ground began to tremble violently.  Rattle―― Grrrrr!  A tremendous tremor shook the earth, enough to make Fran and Urushi’s body waver lightly. Isn’t it about a tremor level of 5? The tremor did not stop, only did it increase in intensity. </p>
<p>「Something is coming out!」</p>
<p>「It’s in the direction of Trismegistus’ castle!」</p>
<p>  Suddenly, something huge appeared in the direction that Fran had pointed to. It appeared after breaking through the earth, but it was hard to figure out due to the dust that flew up. However, behind the veil of dust that covered the air, a huge shadow that seemed to be tens of meters long was clearly visible. No, if it looked so large from this distance, it might be over 100 meters. In terms of size, it was a huge high-rise building.  </p>
<p>「Miss Hilt, I’m waiting here.  I don’t even know what’s going on.」</p>
<p>「... Okay.  Trismegistus, are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Haha!  This is the first time I’ve ever seen anyone worried about their safety.  Besides, he’s an immortal existence. If there’s anyone I can kill, I’d love to know.」</p>
<p>  In the first place, I have no idea who did what.  Was the Dragon King’s devious plan, or did Trismegistus do something? Or was there something wrong with the antidemons themselves?  Since we don’t have much information, we have no choice but to wait here. After a few minutes of waiting and thrashing, a faint silhouette appeared on the other side of the dust.  </p>
<p>「I can see a little!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Oioi......  What the hell is that......?」</p>
<p>The shadows began to wriggle.The shadows began to wriggle. Her peristalsis was clearly alive.</p>
