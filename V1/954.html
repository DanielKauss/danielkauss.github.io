</div><h1>Chapter 954</h1><p>When Isario asked her why she had come to Gordicia, Fran answered with an honest answer.</p>
<p>「I’m employed by the Kingdom of Belioth. But I really want to see Trismegistus. And also, visit a grave.」</p>
<p>「Trismegistus? What should we do after meeting him?」</p>
<p>「It’s a secret. But we definitely have to see him」</p>
<p>「...I see」</p>
<p>He looks suspicious, but I guess he has no intention of forcing us to start. He shrugged his shoulders and let him go. But I won’t forget to give him some advice.</p>
<p>「He’s a monster. It’s not his ability, but his spirit and how he is. So, be prepared before we meet him」</p>
<p>「Your spirit is a monster...?」</p>
<p>「You’ll understand it when you see me. No, at first glance, you don’t seem to understand? It may be that kind of thing is the end of a person who has been kept alive. At best, I’m not going to let them get away with it」</p>
<p>「Nn. Be careful」</p>
<p>When Fran replied so, Isario nodded in satisfaction.</p>
<p>「Should we visit a grave?」</p>
<p>「We need to visit the graves of Mom and Dad. Because they both died on this continent......」</p>
<p>Fran told us about her situation. She traveled with her parents, who wanted to evolve, and settled down on this continent. After a brief happy life, she was attacked by antidemons and enslaved. Master saved her, she became stronger, and she returned to this continent.</p>
<p>「There’s a grave in Castel.」</p>
<p>「...I see」</p>
<p>Isario muttered briefly and turned his head down slightly. Then, he bowed his head to Fran.</p>
<p>「Sorry about that」</p>
<p>「What’s wrong?」</p>
<p>「I got a weird question. Besides, I guess, I had some stupid jealousy about him」</p>
<p>「Jealous?」</p>
<p>Jealousy, was it Isario or something? Against Fran? Neither Fran nor I understood what she meant, and a question mark appeared on our faces.</p>
<p>Isario had never felt such jealousy that she needed to be apologized.</p>
<p>「......I’m just an ordinary person. I don’t have talent, and my thoughts are normal. I guess my 43 years of life is nowhere near as good as when you’ve lived for more than a decade.」</p>
<p>「You’re a Rank S and you have a Divine Sword?」</p>
<p>「Kuku. I just have a Divine Sword」</p>
<p>Isario shrugged with a self-mocking smile on his face.</p>
<p>「A helpless man without talent is just revered by the Divine Sword」</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>Wasn’t she being too condescending about herself? Fran didn’t seem to know how to talk to him either.</p>
<p>「When I first became an adventurer, I was called a genius.」</p>
<p>「An alias?」</p>
<p>「That’s a derogatory title. Exactly. I mean, someone without talent.」</p>
<p>Isario was born in a remote, cold village.</p>
<p>Isario was told that he and his friends jumped out to become an adventurer. It was a poor and harsh village where there was nothing to eat every day. Unable to bear the life of such a village, Isario became an adventurer.</p>
<p>They were the son of one of the poorest peddlers in this poor village. There was no way they could use magic, and they honed their skills as swordsmen. That was all they had to do.</p>
<p>Besides, swords were respected in this world. In mythology, they were probably derived from the defeat of the Evil God by the Sword God. Weapons were, for now, swords. That was the way it was.</p>
<p>Also, if that idea continued for many years, swords themselves would increase all over the world, so they would be cheaper and easier to obtain, and as a result, there would be more swordsmen who would tell us.</p>
<p>Isario the young boy did not leak out, continuing to work as a low-ranking adventurer with his wooden swords and rusty swords from the goblins.</p>
<p>But among these friends, Isario had no talent for swords. While her friends were steadily raising her skill level, only Isario’s skill level did not.</p>
<p>Humans had strict talent differences. Even if they trained in the same way, there would be differences in their skills and status growth.</p>
<p>Isario apparently had no talent for swords. However, the poor did not have time to buy new weapons, so they had no choice but to keep using them.</p>
<p>Then, when we finally had a little leeway, a moment came when we increased our adventurer rank. It was only for our friends except Isario.</p>
<p>Isario was the only one who could not rank up because of his inferior fundamentals. He was the only one who remained weak after being used an inferior weapon.</p>
<p>As a result, our friends decided to cancel their party with Isario. They wanted to earn more money and regroup with stronger adventurers.</p>
<p>Isario became angry, resentful, and lamented, yet he still decided to continue as an adventurer.</p>
<p>That was the only way he knew how to live. No, he probably had the option of returning to the village to help out in the field. However, his small pride did not make him want to run back to the village.</p>
<p>That’s probably because he had some hard headedness towards his comrades and those who didn’t.</p>
<p>I continued to accept lower-ranked requests solo and gradually honed my skills.</p>
<p>The level of his swordsmanship skill continued to rise at a slower rate than before, but it continued to grow at a rate of 2, 3, and 4. He had trained so hard that it wouldn’t be surprising if he had reached the Sword Saint Skills... But he never gave up.</p>
<p>Isario finally realized one part of his talent. It was his defensive talent. He was not very good at attacking, but his parrying and stopping attacks with swords sometimes exceeded his skill level.</p>
<p>Before anyone knew it, his skills had “Receive”, “Slurp”, and “Stop”, and in no time at all, he was able to surpass the level of his swordsmanship.</p>
<p>Perhaps if he had used it with a shield or a sword breaker, he wouldn’t have been abandoned by his friends. Still, Isario liked the sword.</p>
<p>Now I had become so obsessed, so obsessed, and unable to throw away the sword that I didn’t even know why.</p>
<p>Isario had finally become Rank E solo, and there was a rumor that his friend had become Rank C at a young age. It was just before he was 25 years old.</p>
<p>Hearing the news, Isario understood. I knew that I was the only one without talent, but my friends were geniuses. So, I couldn’t stay in their party myself. With loneliness, frustration, and a slight feeling of blessing, I was finally convinced.</p>
<p>But fate is really a mysterious and cruel thing. I’ve never heard of a Goddess who rules over fate, but if she did, she was definitely a prank-loving man.</p>
<p>One day, Isario met him in a corner of the flea market that was selling junk. No one was able to equipped him, and for some reason, I was able to equipped his mysterious magic sword, which was covered in dust.</p>
<p>That was our encounter with the Divine Sword, Ignis.</p>
<p>Isario himself had no idea why he had been chosen. However, I was able to use his power after being equipped with a Divine Sword.</p>
<p>The incompetent Isario turned into a crimson lotus-edged Isario and the adventurer rank rose to S at once. It seems that preferential treatment for owners of the divine swords was allowed by the rules of the Adventurer’s Guild. I guess it was impossible for a Divine Swordsman to be a normal adventurer.</p>
<p>Suddenly, their positions changed, their gazes changed, and people began to turn to us. At the same time, high-ranked requests came to us.</p>
<p>Most of the requests were to exterminate high-ranking magic beasts, which would have been unthinkable to even fight, but it did not take much effort to accomplish.</p>
<p>Originally, he had a high level of defense that did not match the rank. What if the Divine Sword’s attack power was added to that?</p>
<p>Well, in the first place, no defense was needed as long as I had a Divine Sword. We would win if we pulled it out.</p>
<p>Despite the amount of praise he received, his heart was completely empty. After all, his previous training had been in vain. Isario may be strong or weak, it doesn’t matter as long as he has a Divine Sword. The same went for the people’s reactions.</p>
<p>No one had seen Isario in person. They were just looking for a Divine Swordsman, not Isario.</p>
<p>「I was shocked when I saw my former friends again」</p>
<p>His eyes were filled with dissatisfaction, jealousy, and desire, and his attitude was hostile. The genius he once hated turned into mere small objects in front of the Divine Sword, and he became king just by possessing it.</p>
<p>Realizing his ridiculousness, Isario stopped himself from calling himself the Red lotus blade. “No talent”. That was the true form that he should not forget. That was why he continued to call himself stubborn.</p>
<p>「I’m an incompetent Isario. An ordinary person who’s only a little better at defense happens to have a Divine Sword」</p>
<p>That was the reason why he was jealous of Fran, who seemed to have a natural talent for life that he did not have. He was a genius child who was confident in her abilities and enjoyed the present time when she was colored by the glorious past and future.</p>
<p>「You really are a small vessel, aren’t you? I’m just simply getting bored. I can’t pretend that I’m not fit for a fight, I can’t be jealousy, and I apologize on my own... Aah, I don’t like that at all」</p>
<p>Isario said that and looked up to the sky in self-mockery.</p>
