</div><h1>Chapter 985</h1><p>「Divine Sword Release!」</p>
<p>Black magic power overflowed from Berserk, who was still in his scabbard, as if to respond to the voice of Zelyse. And at the same time, white magic power overflowed from his scabbard as well.</p>
<p>Irregular mixture of black and white. Within the sinister black magic power, white magic power wriggled. The white part sometimes looked like a resentful skull, perhaps because of his fear of Berserk?</p>
<p>As the jet-black blade showed itself little by little, a vile magic power suddenly covered the surroundings.</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>『Get out of here, get away!』</p>
<p>Fran and Urushi were still in a cold sweat, even though they were just being enveloped in magic power that had no intention of leaking out.</p>
<p>No, not even if it did not cause direct damage, it did not mean that it did not have a negative effect.</p>
<p>『Tsk! My magic is...!』</p>
<p>The intense magic power of the Great Magic Beast suddenly made it difficult for me to control my magic. I tried to teleport, but the magic didn’t activate properly.</p>
<p>『Sorry, Fran! Run!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Fran increased her speed even more while caring about her back. However, she did not run away straight away.</p>
<p>「Isario!」</p>
<p>「Hey young miss! Don’t stop! This place is in danger!」</p>
<p>They were probably worried about the adventurers running at full speed. So, they called out to Isario, who had already stopped using the Divine Sword Release and was about to become dal.</p>
<p>It was quite worn out, but still not enough to move.</p>
<p>However, their legs were probably quite slow. Besides, the other adventurers were also much slower than Fran.</p>
<p>It was not going to take long for them to escape to the safety zone.</p>
<p>If I had been able to use magic, I would have been able to gain some distance with my dimension gate!</p>
<p>Fran appeared at the head of the group. She turned around and started cheering everyone up. This was a rare thing for Fran though.</p>
<p>「Guys! Do your best!」</p>
<p>「That’s right, young miss! Show them your guts!」</p>
<p>「「「Yeah!」」」</p>
<p>The adventurers responded to Fran’s shout and forced their way up. They were already pretty tired, but Fran, the younger generation, couldn’t help but break their spirits.</p>
<p>That was clearly slowing down the troops. The effect of Fran’s title had been put into effect.</p>
<p>「Isario! The hydrangeas and the old man!」</p>
<p>「Don’t come, but they won’t run away! Don’t worry about it!」</p>
<p>The old soldiers of General Hagane stopped around them to protect the hydrangea that stood there to watch over the young man. Isario was right, they had no intention of running away.</p>
<p>「Anyways, just run!」</p>
<p>「......Nn.」</p>
<p>The adventurers continued to run. After running for almost 30 seconds, their whole legs had finally slowed down. Magicians who were inferior in physical strength had finally started to get hit by it because they kept running at full speed.</p>
<p>They should have been able to run a little further in the first place, but they were exhausted from the series of fierce battles.</p>
<p>Still, the warriors carried the sorceress on their backs and did not stop her from escaping.</p>
<p>Everyone felt this unbearable. A disturbing and sword-thin atmosphere.</p>
<p>「I’m sorry too, Miss Hilt」</p>
<p>「Isario, are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Don’t worry...」</p>
<p>Fran was carrying Isario on her back. It wasn’t enough to collapse, but it seemed to be painful because of exhaustion. Isario didn’t refuse it either.</p>
<p>This was probably because pride was not a priority.</p>
<p>Fran and her party continued to move as if they were being chased by the aura of the vicious Berserk.</p>
<p>『He’s coming!』</p>
<p>I could feel the fierceness of the moment when the beast attacked its prey.</p>
<p>The antidemon dragonkin seemed so sinister that I couldn’t stop him. I could say he wasn’t right in front of me. All I knew was that he was terrified of Berserk’s presence.</p>
<p>That was one of the strongest divine swords that is said to have more combat power than Alpha. I could understand that even though it was not yet in battle.</p>
<p>「Ruoooooooooh!」</p>
<p>A roar echoed through the air, as if it was an animal. Just listening to it made the expressions on the adventurers’ faces stiffer.</p>
<p>Berserk’s magical sphere had already escaped, but its presence did not diminish to the point of shuddering.</p>
<p>Berserk was supposed to be holding him in his hand, but the blade could not be seen because he was clad in such dense jet-black magic power.</p>
<p>And the next moment, the wall of divine flames burst forth and disappeared.</p>
<p>A deep hole has been drilled through from the antidemon dragonkin to the antidemon dragonkin, and a deep hole has been drilled through from there.</p>
<p>The antidemon dragonkin, who should have boasted high defense, was defeated in two. It was so easily that it made me wonder if he was weak.</p>
<p>「「「「Uuooourgh!」」」」</p>
<p>The antidemon dragonkin, who had let them make a preemptive strike, braced themselves with caution. They were probably also instinctively terrified of Berserk.</p>
<p>Instead of immediately attacking them, they spread around the snowy area.</p>
<p>However, without letting him wait, he rushed toward the antidemon dragonkin himself.</p>
<p>「You have to die!」</p>
<p>A rattling, old, beast-like voice of Pine Snow echoed through the battlefield.</p>
<p>Berserk, who had been greatly shaken, emitted a small amount of magic power, like black petal, enveloping the antidemon dragonkin.</p>
<p>「Grrr!」</p>
<p>The antidemon dragonkin began to suffer instantly. I could feel his body rapidly wilting. That must be a stronger version of what he had seen before he was liberated.</p>
<p>But I was more curious than Berserk’s abilities. I guess he was in a mental state. He seemed to be quite excited, but he didn’t seem to be out of control.</p>
<p>What do you mean? If we let Berserk go, he’ll keep on rampaging until he dies, right?</p>
