</div><h1>Chapter 1126</h1><p>「A Divine vessel! That Divine vessel is worthy of us!」</p>
<p> So that’s why they call it a Divine vessel! Do you think Mareficent and the others have anything nasty? Don’t confuse the examiner with the exam! But that wouldn’t be a reason to target Fran then. </p>
<p>(That guy is watching over Master)</p>
<p>『Eh? Me?』</p>
<p>(Nn, I’m sure of it)</p>
<p> So, I’m a Divine vessel? No, it was here, huh? Well, it was made by a Divine level blacksmith, wasn’t it? They even call it a Divine Sword, but I didn’t know it was a Divine vessel. They even said it was a near-Divine Sword, but I didn’t know it was a Divine vessel.  </p>
<p>「Little girl!  That Divine vessel!  Bring the sword to me!  I can feel the power of the Evil God! That sword is exactly the Divine vessel of the Evil God!」</p>
<p>  The undead were really aiming at me. It seemed that they sniffed away the pieces of the Evil God sealed inside me.  Fran and everyone, I’m so sorry! It was because of me that they attacked me!  </p>
<p>「...... You take the sword from me?」</p>
<p>「That’s right!  An undead girl like you is not worthy of that divine vessel! Bring it on us!」</p>
<p>「......」</p>
<p>  Fran’s face fell silent.  It wasn’t only me, the righteous soldiers could see it. And a tremendous amount of killing intent was scattered about.  Not only the brave soldiers who were supposed to have been braced, but even the ghouls, who were supposed to have little fear of death, screamed and backed away. They must have imagined how miserable they would be.  Fran’s killing intent was dense and vicious. But even with this, she was only thinking about her comrades for a little bit, and she wasn’t serious.  </p>
<p>「Mareficent. Take care of things around you with everyone」</p>
<p>「Understood」</p>
<p> Mareficent and Persona nodded violently as if they were in sync.  </p>
<p>「I’ll―― You’re gonna crush this guy.」</p>
<p>  The moment Fran muttered these words, even more killing intent struck the ghouls than before. If it had been against the brave soldiers, their hearts would have stopped beating.  Even the commander, Ghoul, who had asked them to give me, seemed to have understood Fran’s strength. His ability to search for an opponent’s strength seemed to be low, but when he was hit with this much killing intent and intimidation, he seemed to understand even if he didn’t like it.  However, it was only for a moment that he was under pressure. He immediately jumped at Fran with a crazed roar.  </p>
<p>「Uggaaaaaah!  Bring it on!  Jiggyii!」</p>
<p> Fran and the commander, Ghoul, collided.  Ghoul’s attack was a slash with a long extended claw, but this was harder than I had imagined.  After all, it was able to strike me head-on. It snapped in a few hits, but new claws were soon appearing.  It lost less magic power, but no damage. It seemed that its claws could be regenerated as long as it wanted.  However, Fran was by far the best in swordsmanship.  All of Ghoul’s claws were repelled and handled. Her physical abilities were superior to Fran’s, but that was only until Fran used Brilliant Lightning Rush.  Her strength was overwhelmingly superior to her, but she didn’t know what she needed to do if she got hit. She couldn’t get away with following Fran, who had the advantage of speed and sword skills.  </p>
<p>「Nugaaaa!」</p>
<p>  Just like her trump card, the ghoul sprayed poison on the surrounding area.  It was a terrifying poison that could inflict magic poison on the person she touched and even gradually melt the meat.  It was not to be ashamed of the name of the Genocide Ghoul, which takes the lives of all living things with a single touch. If this was repeated occurrences in its water source and granary area, the country would surely collapse.  But it was meaningless for Fran.But that didn’t work for Fran.  She had skills such as Abnormal Condition Resistance, Healing Magic, Purification Magic, and Poison Absorption.  The poison smoke from the massacre that killed all lives was no more than just a blindfold.  She was worried about her friends for a moment, but there was no problem with that either.  After all, Mareficent’s wide area wards were way too good.  It reminded me of Seliadot’s skill.  The wards that cover every brave soldier completely nullified the poison. Fran, relieved to see them, jumped towards the ghoul.Fran dodged all of the ghoul’s claws and cut through the poisonous smoke, slashing at its reddish-black rotten body.  </p>
<p>「...!」</p>
<p>  The sword flashed and flew off her head without even screaming.  At the same time, her slashes broke through her arms, legs, and torso.  In addition, black lightning raged wildly in her body, causing smoke to rise from all over the ghoul’s body.  Some of it was charred.  Normally, she would have been a match for an ant.  However, this ghoul was not ordinary. It was originally a top-ranking species with high regenerative power and was strengthened by evil spirits.  Before it was blown away and falling into the ground, he had regenerated not only his arms and legs, but even his head and was back to his perfect body. It landed as if nothing had happened and jumped back at it.  It was the type of claw that only pushed itself with its physical and regenerative abilities. Moreover, their claws originally had poisons in them that could cause multiple abnormalities in their status, and even death poison magic.  Their tactic was that as long as we graze them, they would have an advantage at once.  Well, if they had both poisons and evil spirits, there was a chance they could beat even a superior opponent. Even a Rank A adventurer might be able to get poison injected with their skills nullified by the evil energy.  But that was meaningless for Fran though.  </p>
<p>「Guh!  Why, it doesn’t work!  Besides, my power is whittled down...! Is it the power of the divine organ!?」</p>
<p>  Well, that’s right.  To be more precise, it was the effect of the Evil Crusher skill I had. It’s not enough to completely inhibit regeneration, but every time Fran’s slash hit, the evil energy of the ghoul was whittled down and its regeneration speed slowed down.  Evil and healing.  We had the kind of natural enemy that the ghoul, who was afraid of destroying even a country, was capable of. Our compatibility was too bad, wasn’t it?  So, I decided to try something I had been thinking about before. </p>
<p>『Evil Spirit Conquest, activate!』</p>
<p>  Until now, this skill had only been used to protect Fran from evil spirits and to control the pieces of the Evil God sealed inside me.  But what if I could use it directly against an evil spirited person? I wondered if I could absorb their power or, if I could, manipulate their behavior. That was what I thought when I used the skill, but it seemed to have worked unexpectedly.  </p>
<p>「Guh!  T-This is!」</p>
<p>  The ghouls’ movements were visibly dull.  This was not an evil person, but an undead with evil energy.  At this rate, it would be effective against evil people. Slayer your evil spirits by slashing and slashing!』</p>
<p>「Nn!</p>
<p>「Shiiiit!」</p>
