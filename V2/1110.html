</div><h1>Chapter 1110</h1><p>Klimut stared at the spirit, released his magic power, and took the throne. On the other hand, the Great Spirit of Wind did not move much. Neither of them moved at the slightest bit on the spot. However, Klimut and the Great Spirit were indeed connected and seemed to be in a tug-of-war between them. Gradually, sweat began to permeate Klimut’s forehead and his expression began to contort. It seemed that it was not going to be so simple. Then Klimut opened his mouth without paying attention to us. Then Klimut opened his mouth without paying attention to us.  </p>
<p>「Fran-san, please take care of this」</p>
<p>「What?」</p>
<p>「I want you to attack the Great Spirit」</p>
<p>「...You won’t be countered?」</p>
<p>  It would be dangerous not only for us but also for Klimut and the others if they were attacked by the Great Spirit. Klimut shook his head with an expression of frustration and fatigue.  </p>
<p>「As for the counterattack, I need to avoid it somehow. I really don’t want to let him do such a dangerous thing, but that is the only way now」</p>
<p>  The reason why the Great Spirit was not attacked right now was because he was close to Klimut. It was probably also thanks to this that Urushi and Zenos were safe. The reason why they suddenly stopped attacking us after we broke through the wall of tornadoes was the same reason.  However, if we attack them, they would be classified as perfect enemies and we would be subject to a fierce counterattack. Even if we knew this, Klimut seemed to be so cornered that we had to ask Fran, a child, to do it.  </p>
<p>「Understood」</p>
<p>  Fran nodded enthusiastically. It couldn’t be helped, since we couldn’t leave Alessa behind...  </p>
<p>『We don’t know what kind of counterattack we might see next.  We’re going to fight the strongest enemy in the history of mankind!』</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
<p> Klimut told Fran about his weakness.  </p>
<p>「There’s a core part somewhere.  Please aim for that」</p>
<p>「Where?」</p>
<p>「There’s no doubt that it’s his torso... Fran-san can use spirit magic, right?」</p>
<p>「Do you understand?」</p>
<p>  Klimut said so with a confident look on his face.  He shouldn’t have told her that he had learned to use spirit magic. However, it seemed that Klimut knew.  </p>
<p>「The spirits are reacting.  If you have the skill of Spirit Magic, you should be able to find the nucleus. Perhaps」</p>
<p>  , maybe...  No, it was an emergency that could only be helped there. On the surface, Klimut looked calm, but in fact, he may be close to the limit.  </p>
<p>「Should we attack the nucleus?」</p>
<p>「Yes.  The undead’s attack has weakened the great spirit.  If we can weaken it even further, we may have complete control over it. That may make it possible to return it」</p>
<p>「Can I return the great spirit?」</p>
<p>  Isn’t it a trump card for Klimut?  I’m sure it was Klimut’s pronoun spirit, which was the source of his alias. However, Klimut nodded back at Fran with a wry smile.  </p>
<p>「It matters.  It’s the spirit, and it’s me too」</p>
<p>  He said that his abilities were reduced due to his focus on the seal, and maybe he just wanted to unload his burden. </p>
<p>「How did the enemy hurt the spirit?」</p>
<p>  Aah, I’m curious about that too. Maybe we could use it to attack him too.  But Klimut shook his head with a bitter look on his face.  </p>
<p>「We can’t imitate it.  It’s an Evil Spirit. If it was an Evil Spirit, there was nothing I couldn’t use.  But if it was to make it go out of control, would it be dangerous for us to use it? There was no doubt that it was a considerable bet.  </p>
<p>「It seems that the weapon that the undead possessed originally had the property of devouring magic power.  Evil Spirits were added to it and my defenses were broken through. Magic power absorption-type attacks may be effective in breaking through the spirits’ defenses.」</p>
<p>  Eating magic power?  Maybe it was a skill similar to the magic sword, the Soul Drain, used by a swordsman named Valusa who fought in Dars. Maybe Raydoss succeeded in mass-producing it.  If so, our Magic Absorption and Magic Steal could be effective.  We got some good information from him.  </p>
<p>「Are you ready?」</p>
<p>「Nn!  I can go at any time!」</p>
<p>「Then we’ll move the great spirit out of town. It will use a lot of power, so please think of it as we don’t have much time after that」</p>
<p>「... Okay」</p>
<p>  When Fran nodded, I could see that Klimut’s concentration increased a notch.  </p>
<p>「Let’s go!」</p>
<p>  A tremendous amount of magic power was released from Klimut’s entire body. It was so strong that Urushi and the others standing next to him were even incited to back down.  At the same time, the great spirit had made a movement.  It began to move slowly.  Even though its huge body was moving, it had no physical presence at all. The sound of its footsteps was obvious, and there was no wind movement. It was as if the hologram was moving.  We held our breath and waited for a few minutes.  The Great Spirit was about a hundred meters from the town.  It seemed that orders would not be delivered anymore. </p>
<p>「I’m gonna ask for a serious blow」</p>
<p>「The Great Spirit will not die, right?」</p>
<p>「That would be a big deal if I could do that.  So, I won’t hold back」</p>
<p>  Then why don’t we go all out.  </p>
<p>『You don’t need to hold back, huh?』</p>
<p>「Nn. Okay, I’ll do it serious」</p>
<p>「Yeah, if possible, I’ll do it in a way that won’t cause any damage to the town」</p>
<p>「... Okay」</p>
<p>「I’m afraid of the time between them!」</p>
<p>  I’m the same!  </p>
<p>『Fran.  You’re not going to be frivolous, are you?』</p>
<p>(Fran?)</p>
<p>『... It’s nothing.</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
