</div><h1>Chapter 971</h1><p>We launched our all-out attack at the giant-type that had fallen down in a downward state.</p>
<p>「Thor Hammer!」</p>
<p>『Kanna Kamui!』</p>
<p>「Wooo~f!」</p>
<p>My multiple Kanna Kamui and Fran’s magic poured down on the giant head. By itself, the upper half of the huge head, which was about the size of a small apartment building, was shattered, and black mysterious substances overflowed instead of brain power.</p>
<p>We were then bombarded with countless flames now. Naturally, we were not the only ones who attacked the giant.</p>
<p>Isario’s flames. A rock spear that seemed to belong to a small child. Afterward, the arrows and magic from the soldiers and adventurers were fired at him.</p>
<p>Hundreds of attacks would have been inflicted around the torso. And this was not the end.</p>
<p>The old soldiers of the Kingdom of Hagane gathered in several places, and a huge amount of magic power was emanating from each group. It was a ritual magic that multiple people unleashed a single kind of magic.</p>
<p>After the long chanting that lasted for more than a minute, a number of huge clumps of flames were released, probably in time with Isario.</p>
<p>More than ten flame masses then landed on the giant-type in a large arc. It seemed to be a spell that kept burning with the flames of magic that did not disappear easily rather than an explosion.</p>
<p>The upper half of the giant’s body was almost covered with flames. Even so, it was not even close to defeating the giant antidemons. It had been damaged, but it was still going strong.</p>
<p>『Fran! Don’t let him get up!』</p>
<p>「Nn! Urushi, I’ll do my right arm!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Fran readied me on her shoulder and gave Urushi instructions. Urushi, who had run down from the sky at once, was running in a trajectory that snatched at the giant right arm.</p>
<p>As Fran swung me at full power as we passed each other, she cut deeply into the right wrist of the giant figure. Although she could not even cut it, she was able to interfere with its action.</p>
<p>The giant-type, which had been putting power into its arms to stand up, collapsed again when it became unable to use one of its arms. Its huge body then plunged into the ground again from its right shoulder.</p>
<p>「Young miss!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Even if we couldn’t defeat it with a single blow, we would just keep chipping it away at it.</p>
<p>On the way there, the giant-type released magic power from its entire body and tried to blow everything away, but even so, the second unit did not lose.</p>
<p>Fran, Isario, and the soldiers of the Kingdom of Hagane had put up multiple barriers to prevent the release of magic power.</p>
<p>In the end, the second unit defeated the giant-types without even losing a single soldier. In the end, we would only end up with Isario and my all-out magic.</p>
<p>The giant-type had its head burned and a hole was drilled into its chest. Finally, its regenerative power could not catch up with it, and its huge body slowly fell apart.</p>
<p>After defeating the giants, the second unit moved straight to the collapsed town to check for any antidemons.</p>
<p>We never rescued any survivors. This unit was only to defeat the giants. Rescuing, reconstruction, and cooking were the work of the other troops.</p>
<p>「I wonder if we might consider abandoning the town too」</p>
<p>「Is that so?」</p>
<p>「It will take a lot of time to rebuild it. It’s a valuable safety zone, but it’s difficult to use it as a town right away. The residents are said to be annihilated too」</p>
<p>「......Nn.」</p>
<p>The antidemons were still scurrying around, but there was no one living there.</p>
<p>Isario and Zelos Reed had hypothesized that the antidemons might have attacked the town since the giant-type magic absorption prevented people from moving.</p>
<p>I think the reason why antidemons were still in town was to destroy the safety zone...... I didn’t understand why they were still there, even when the town was occupied by antidemons.</p>
<p>Was there anything in town that attracted antidemons? Was there a survivor somewhere that was attracted to its magic power?</p>
<p>Isario and Sibylla decided to scout out the area where the giant-type had first gone berserk and see if there was anything wrong with it.</p>
<p>We also searched for any presence in the town from Urushi’s back. Then Fran and Urushi noticed something at the same time.</p>
<p>I was a moment late, and I knew it.</p>
<p>(Master, this is)</p>
<p>『Yeah. Evil spirits.』</p>
<p>I could sense a dense evil spirit from one corner of the ground.</p>
<p>The huge hole in the wall of rubble had been completely covered with snow.</p>
<p>I wondered if there was a higher-level antidemon inside, but its evil energy position did not move at all.</p>
<p>『Urushi, take care of the guards and the antidemons here.』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>『Let’s remove the rubble.』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>After carefully stowing away the rubble, we headed for the bottom of the hole. After about half a minute, Fran pointed to a gap in the rubble under her feet.</p>
<p>「Master, that...」</p>
<p>『Somehow, there’s a purple light shining from below!』</p>
<p>The most similar thing was the glow of the evil crystals we had seen the other day. Perhaps the Dragon King’s plot had taken off here as well. And maybe there were evil crystals underneath.</p>
<p>Normally, an evil crystal would have been crushed by a giant-type. However, there might have been some evil crystals that had entered a gap in the rubble and could not be broken miraculously.</p>
<p>Anyway, we wanted to find out if these crystals were really evil or not.</p>
<p>We continued our search for more crystals. We arrived at the bottom of the hole without having discovered any evil crystals. It was probably originally an underground hall about 20 meters below ground level.</p>
<p>And there was something surprising about it that emitted evil energy. There was a huge magic circle painted on the floor. A magic circle that emitted dark purple light scattered thick evil energy all around. No, we were able to find evil crystals by further removing the rubble so that we could see the entire magic circle.</p>
<p>A small evil crystal was placed in the center of the magic circle. I guess it was providing power to the magic circle due to the flow of magic power. Moreover, it seemed to be more than just a device to pollute the surroundings with evil energy.</p>
<p>My money-type skill was reacting strangely to this magic circle. It seemed to have some kind of effect on antidemons. Judging from the behavior of the giant humans, it must have had an effect on luring antidemons.</p>
<p>『Let’s just store these evil crystals for now』</p>
<p>(And we’ll also destroy the magic circle)</p>
<p>『Yeah』</p>
<p>However, there was something that was a little bothering me.</p>
<p>『There were a lot of evil crystals in the basement of Sendia, right?』</p>
<p>And yet, there was only one small one here. Did they have few of it from the beginning? Or maybe someone else had retrieved it except for one that was used to start the magic circle?</p>
