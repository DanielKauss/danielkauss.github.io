</div><h1>Chapter 959</h1><p>Fran hurriedly moved away from Isario and watched over him against the giant antidemons. Perhaps she had confirmed this, I saw red mana rising from Isario.</p>
<p>As if chasing after the gushing magic power, flames erupted from Isario’s body. The radiant flames swirled violently as if to intimidate the surroundings and then converged on Isario’s right hand.</p>
<p>In her right hand, she was holding a clump of flames that emitted crimson she had seen before.</p>
<p>The antidemons that had broken through the way caught up with us, but just by getting closer to Isario, they flared up and disappeared. A reasonably strong black antidemon was no different from the moths swarming around the bonfire.</p>
<p>「A Divine Sword... It’s still amazing」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>『Yeah』</p>
<p>「And Isario too」</p>
<p>『They must be a Divine Swordsman. They’re not normal after all』</p>
<p>His appearance was still the same as before, but his presence was overwhelming. Not only was he a Divine Sword, but Isario himself, who used it, was emitting a strong radiance.</p>
<p>Compared to the giant antidemons facing each other, it was not inferior in power.</p>
<p>「Isario has made a move.」</p>
<p>『Just in case, don’t let your guard down so you can escape at any time, okay?』</p>
<p>「Nn. I know.」</p>
<p>I didn’t know if the place where we were was was safe or not. It was just that much magic power.</p>
<p>It looked more serious now than when facing more than 10,000 antidemons. We saw the giant antidemons as our only opponent.</p>
<p>It was also a big factor that the opponent was still unable to move. It was already possible to release the power of a powerful Divine Sword with a well-developed structure.</p>
<p>「Haaa...... Phew......」</p>
<p>With Isario’s breathing, Ignis, the radiant Flame Sword positioned above one hand, grew brighter. The radiance was as fierce and fierce as the sun, and Fran even had to narrow her eyes lightly.</p>
<p>I had seen the higher level fire magic that Velmeria, controlled by Fanatics, unleashed at the royal capital. At that time, I compared the intense flames to the sun.</p>
<p>However, the intensity of the glow that Ignis wore was probably far greater than the flames from that time.</p>
<p>Fran and Urushi’s center of gravity tilted slightly back. I had subconsciously prepared to escape at any moment.</p>
<p>Then, Ignis, who was so bright that no one could see it, swung down from above.</p>
<p>I see, she’s quite insane.</p>
<p>Considering that Isario’s attack was a slash, it was probably a decent blow. I’d say it was at the level of a master of Holy Sword Mastery.</p>
<p>But that’s about it. It’s not an attack that makes one feel a distanced talent. Ignis probably didn’t have the ability to grant Swordking Mastery.</p>
<p>However, it had been an enormous amount of practice and a slash that showed her obsession for the sword. The polite movement she had acquired through her training was precious.</p>
<p>Knowing the limit of his power, that’s why he puts all his power into a single blow.</p>
<p>Indeed, Isario’s own power may have no effect for the attack power of the Divine Sword. Perhaps it was originally only 100,000 attack power that was 101. If the swinging down was more clumsy and appropriate, it might be no problem.</p>
<p>But even though that was the case, Ignis must have approved of Isario because he was able to release his Divine Sword with such seriousness.</p>
<p>Isario’s mental strength, which allowed him to understand the power and weight of the Divine Sword and continue to make efforts without drowning, was worthy of respect.</p>
<p>Fran’s gaze seemed to be filled with awe. She must feel the same way I do.</p>
<p>Then a ray of light raged beneath us.</p>
<p>The flames looked white because they were so blinding. The blade of flames, which was over a hundred meters long, cut through the giant antidemons and cut deep into the earth beyond.</p>
<p>「Yeeeeeeeeee!」</p>
<p>The giant antidemons, split in half on the left and right, screamed in disbelief. How could I describe it as a series of commercial loudspeakers lined up and screamed loudly?</p>
<p>The voices were so loud that Fran and Urushi, who were still in the sky, had covered their ears.</p>
<p>Is Isario okay? His voice was enough to gouge the surrounding land over a wide area, and that was already a sonic attack.</p>
<p>However, it was still a Divine Swordsman. She stood there leisurely, showing no signs of taking any damage.</p>
<p>『It’s over!』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>The flames erupted from the section cut open by Ignis and pierced the entire body of the giant antidemon. Before they could fully regenerate the higher tier antidemons, they quickly turned into ashes and disappeared.</p>
<p>I don’t know what the purpose of that giant antidemon was created. I don’t know if it was created by something or if it was the antidemon’s own will. However, it was definitely not complete yet.</p>
<p>I don’t know why he appeared above ground, seemingly defenseless. Was it okay to be hit by a few attacks, or was it difficult to make it bigger in the underground?</p>
<p>Anyway, she didn’t make any attempts to attack the surroundings at the moment. No, it was probably just that magic power absorption ability that allowed her to dry up enemies and grow herself.</p>
<p>If there were too many enemies, I would use magic absorption to prey on them for growth, and from powerful enemies, I would protect myself with the vitality and defense of my huge body.</p>
<p>I think that was what it was all about.</p>
<p>But their opponent was just too skilled.</p>
<p>Ignoring the magic power absorption, there was nothing I could do in front of the wielder of annihilation power, no matter how huge its body was.</p>
<p>「Isario, I’m calling you.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Isario must have decided that it was over. He was waving his hand at us.</p>
<p>When we returned to him, the heat around him was tremendous. It was because of the aftermath of his attack.</p>
<p>Isario may be on this continent because he has few people involved with Ignis. Since this was originally the land of death, it was hard for him to become a big problem even if he had to change his terrain a little.</p>
<p>「Are you okay? You tired?」</p>
<p>「Hahaha, I guess you could say I’m a little serious.」</p>
<p>I was born several decades ago, it seems. Not that it means much to me considering how I don’t remember living that long myself.</p>
<p>As Fran was worried, Isario seemed to be exhausted. He was sweating on his forehead. It was not that he could not walk, but it seemed to be quite painful.</p>
<p>But that was not the only thing that had bothered Fran.</p>
<p>「......The price is really high, huh?」</p>
<p>「Oh, he’s a very well-informed person. That’s fine. Uncle has been using a Divine Sword for a long time now. I have a sense of how much you’d need to pay for it」</p>
<p>「Good to hear.」</p>
<p>「Well, I’m not going to complain because I can unleash that much attack at levels 1 and 2 now」</p>
<p>It seems that the price of Ignis was around level. Fran didn’t want that, but I guess we could get it right by pretending to be aware of the wind.</p>
