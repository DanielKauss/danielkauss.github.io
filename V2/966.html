</div><h1>Chapter 966</h1><p>「Knights of Silard are currently staying at an inn atop the plaza.」</p>
<p> Fran had finished exchanging information with Mea, and successfully reunited with Sophie. With her guide, she moved to meet Addle. Velmeria and Frederick had already left town to find the Dragon King’s whereabouts. While moving, we also talked to Sophie, but she said that she was still unable to use her Divine Sword. </p>
<p>「Can I use appraisal?」</p>
<p>「Fran, can I use appraisal? Okay, take a look at it.」</p>
<p> Okay, take a look at it, okay?」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>  After receiving her permission and appraising it, the Divine Sword Release section was now■■■■■. When I said so, Mea said she wanted me to see her too.  I guess she had nothing to hide now.  There was no sign of■■■ on Mea’s status. What was the difference between the two Divine Sword users? Come to think of it, there seemed to be a difference between her being recognized by the Divine Sword.  Sophie may be capable enough to open the Divine Sword, but she wasn’t able to make full use of the Divine Sword Release for various reasons. From what we’ve heard, it seemed like a mental reason.  However, Sophie didn’t seem to be in a hurry. She seemed to have a certainty that she will be able to use it when needed. In Mea’s case, she was probably not yet fully capable, and she was not qualified to use the divine sword release itself. </p>
<p>「Hmm, Addle.」</p>
<p>『Well timing.』</p>
<p>  So she didn’t need to enter the inn, and Ader and the holy knights were already in front of the inn. It wasn’t like they were leaving town, so they were planning to go somewhere.  The holy knights were nervous, probably noticing Fran and Amanda as they approached. </p>
<p>「Leave this to me.」</p>
<p>「Are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Don’t worry, I’m just gonna calm them down. They’re weirdly aggressive, no matter how much I try to protect Adono.」</p>
<p>  As she approached them with a smile, Mea waved her hand with a smile. The tension was relieved, as if she remembered Mea’s face as well. But instead, an atmosphere of contempt was created in which she looked down on us.  </p>
<p>「Welcome to Silard, the Holy Nation! Are you going somewhere?」</p>
<p>「I can hear them without any shouts.  What did you want from those dirty criminal organizations? Apparently, she didn’t know Mea’s identity.  If she knew that she was the princess, she would be a little more concerned about her appearance and would not be able to sell her sword. She didn’t seem to know that Lind was a Divine Sword.  </p>
<p>「Well, that’s fine.  We’re now at a good place. Lead her to the saintess」</p>
<p>「... Why?」</p>
<p>「That recovery ability is worthy of our country.  I decided to take her with me.」</p>
<p>  What did you decide to take with me!  Fran was also quite annoyed with it.  But didn’t she seem to know that she was a Divine Sword user? If they really decided to force her to take the Divine Sword user with them, they would act more cautiously. Perhaps the appraisers of the Holy Nation could not see through Sophie’s abilities.  </p>
<p>「I see. But Saintess-sama had declared that she would stay in this city, so I think the negotiations were in vain, right?」</p>
<p>「That’s not for you to decide.」</p>
<p>「Well, please negotiate later.  I brought a messenger from the Adventurers Guild.」</p>
<p>「Hmph.  You mean an emissary?」</p>
<p>  The holy knight sighed and looked at Fran and Sophie who were standing at a distance. He probably didn’t like Mea’s attitude of being equal with them.  However, his face soon turned into astonishment.  </p>
<p>「Red lotus blade......!」</p>
<p>  The holy knights must have known Isario’s face.  Besides, they were not very close to each other. That was quite a nuisance in Nocta.  </p>
<p>「You saved this city, didn’t you? Don’t you do something rare, you guys?」</p>
<p>「W-What are you talking about!?  We are the glorious knights of the Holy Nation! Our mission is to protect the weak!」</p>
<p>「Hmm? W-Well, that’s fine.」</p>
<p>  The holy knight’s expression became flush with anger at Isario’s disinterested response to his words. He looked completely uninterested in Isario’s words, or rather, he would stare into the hole in his ear with his little finger. I could even sense his killing intent from the holy knight’s blunt forehead, but I guess he could not appeal to the divine swordsman by force. </p>
<p>「What?」</p>
<p>「Many countries have already decided to accept the request.  Naturally, the Adventurers Guild will do the same. No one will forget their duty, but how about it?」</p>
<p>「N-Of course! What do you think we are!?」</p>
<p>「Ooh!  That’s great fortune!」</p>
<p>  So this was the reason Isario provoked him. He probably offended them to make it easier for them to talk.  But they waited for him.  He was an appraiser. Apparently, they were working in a different chain of command than the holy knights, and this unit seemed to have a lot of say in them.  </p>
<p>「Wait! The Divine Sword Knight has been using the power of the Divine Sword on this continent three times already.  He won’t allow any further fighting.」</p>
<p>  The appraiser was right, Ader didn’t seem to be in top form.  He didn’t seem to be worn out, but he seemed to be a little tired. She looked like an accounting officer through the day, so I guess she wouldn’t be able to fight well.  Isario also sighed lightly and spoke in a nasty way.  </p>
<p>「Third time?  Then I’ll be fine.  After all, I’m also a Divine Sword user.  Moreover, the Alpha of the Holy Nation and my Ignis of the same Divine level blacksmith are both made by the same Divine level blacksmith.  I know how tough it can be. If it’s only for three times, I’m sure we can go there still.  Aah― , or maybe you just call yourself a Divine Sword Knight and say that you can’t fight anymore in just three times?  That’s weak.  I never thought she would have anything less ability than me, Rotor?」</p>
<p>「Kuh......!」</p>
<p>  The appraiser could not say anything back at Isario’s words.  After all, the Divine Sword user was the most knowledgeable about the Divine Swords.  He could not say that he was lying what Isario said.  Besides, Silard would never miss out on his last words.  The Divine Sword Knight, who had made his country a strong country, asked if he was inferior to an adventurer.  Of course, he would not nod, but if he denied it, he would affirm that Ader could still fight. Either way, the disadvantages were great. They probably wanted to avoid pushing Ader any further and run away as soon as possible from the continent where the change was taking place.  </p>
<p>「I heard that General Hagane accepted the request, you know?  No, that’s a great country!  It’s a great decision, isn’t it?」</p>
<p>「Gnrgh...」</p>
<p>「So?  What are you going to do?  Will you accept it? If they were cowards and only thought about themselves and wanted to prove that the Divine Sword Knights are inferior to adventurers, wouldn’t you?」</p>
<p>「Damn!」</p>
<p>  In the end, they had no choice but to accept the request.  If they could not do anything by force, rejecting it would be a matter that they couldn’t do from the beginning. If they refused, they would be condemned by the rest of the world.  It was because Silard was a major country that they had to protect their prestige. Well, I guess they could only do something like this if they had Isario beyond the country by themselves.  What bothered me was that Ader did not give them the final decision. Although she was being treated as a superior, Ader didn’t seem to have the power to decide.Being a major power was exactly why it was necessary to protect its prestige. Well, I guess we could do something like this without provoking her to do something other than Isario beyond the country. What bothered me was that Ader did not give us the final decision. Although she was being treated as a superior, Ader didn’t seem to have the power to decide. Even as Ader himself didn’t complain, they seemed to have the highest authority for command.</p>
