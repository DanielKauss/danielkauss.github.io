</div><h1>Chapter 1033</h1><p>『Phew......』</p>
<p> The negative emotions that flowed from Fanaverta finally calmed down. </p>
<p>『I’m fine now.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p> While holding me in her arms, Fran glared at Trismegistus. </p>
<p>「So this is a reward?」</p>
<p>「Indeed.」</p>
<p> She had lost her partner, who had been with her for many years, but there was no trace of emotion in Trismegistus’ voice. In the face of Trismegistus, I lost the will to anger him. In the face of Trismegistus, I lost the will to anger him. It was pitiful. Juanaverta was easily told that he was “not necessary” by someone I had been wishing for for many years, and Trismegistus was not sad to lose his partner.  But in his eyes―― No, is there just a little bit of emotional swing?  I knew it.  Was there sadness?  Did I mix up with Juanaverta before he went completely crazy? Or was it just my heart, which I hoped would be, that was what Juanaverta’s feelings were showing?  Fran seemed to have a similar idea, and her ears were drooping limply.Fran seemed to have a similar thought, and her ears were drooping limply.  The anger and killing intent that had been emitted from her earlier disappeared, and she felt a strong sympathy for Trismegistus and Zelos Reed.  She must have felt fear at the too great difference from herself.  It was exactly an encounter with the unknown.  She tightened her strength into the arm holding me.  </p>
<p>「I know that sword has the power of cannibalism.  That’s why I transferred my power」</p>
<p>『Are there any spares on Juanaverta?  Are they backing up their memories?』</p>
<p>「No such things」</p>
<p>『Seriously...』</p>
<p>  If that was the case, would this guy continue to be punished by the gods on his own for a long time to come? I know he has his own business, but that is――. Trismegistus’ figure, who had been answering our question, suddenly blurted out.  </p>
<p>「Hmm.  My body is the limit――」</p>
<p>「It disappeared?」</p>
<p>  Suddenly, Trismegistus’ figure disappeared into the void.  I guess it meant that the time limit on how long he could stay outside the barrier had reached. At about the same time, Isario regained consciousness.  </p>
<p>「Fran, huh...?」</p>
<p>「Isario, are you okay?」</p>
<p>「... It’s safer than I thought. Why?」</p>
<p>『It’s Trismegistus.』</p>
<p> I explained to him that Trismegistus had used the original sin of jealousy to save Isario. After hearing that, he seemed to have accepted.  </p>
<p>「I’m a very important asset.  That’s what he behaves like.」</p>
<p>『He said he took a few hours’ worth of time, but how is it?』</p>
<p>  I checked Isario’s condition.  He was still worn out and recoiled until we arrived at the castle, but there was no problem. He had already gotten up and was able to walk normally. On the contrary, he was back to a level that should have been reduced as the price of a Divine Sword.  With this appearance, he should even be able to fight. We asked him about Trismegistus’ actions this time. </p>
<p>『Isario, what do you think Trismegistus did?』</p>
<p>  I don’t have enough justice to kill him. But I don’t have enough patience to forgive him because he was a pitiful person.  I thought I should kill him, but I couldn’t kill him.  In the first place, there was even a possibility that the Gods would punish me if I were to confront him and interfere with him. In the end, was it only possible to stand by and not do anything? </p>
<p>『I know I don’t know what to do with them anymore...』</p>
<p>「I know you’re offended, but I have no choice but to give up because I think that’s what they are like.  No matter what we say, that won’t change, and we can’t eliminate it. Besides, we’re the ones who’re trespassing the barrier」</p>
<p>「He said that he shouldn’t be there unless they can fight」</p>
<p>「That’s one truth too」</p>
<p>『But we need someone who can produce to keep fighting, right? They need a town to do that, and when people gather, they will have children and expand the town.』</p>
<p>  Certainly, there are many people who were meaningless from Trismegistus’ point of view. However, there were blacksmiths, alchemists, and cooks, and I wondered if such people were necessary for the dragonkin to keep fighting within the barrier.  </p>
<p>「Trismegistus, who does not need to be replenished, and the dragonkin who can enter the outside of the barrier.  I guess that’s not an absolute reason for creating a stronghold inside the barrier. Instead, they must have judged that there were more disadvantages to having so many people living within the barrier and continuing to be sucked out of it.」</p>
<p> Trismegistus and the dragonkin were the ones who intended to atone for their crimes.Originally, this was the place for Trismegistus and the dragonkin to atone for their crimes.  Moreover, they had told Fran not to enter unless the Gods could fight them.  If you interfere with them, they might be excused, and if you go into the barrier on your own, you should accept it and live.  </p>
<p>「Think of it as a natural disaster, Trismegistus and the antidemons.  That’s what I don’t think you can do on this continent.」</p>
<p>『...... That may be true. But I...』</p>
<p>「That’s fine.  If you can break through it so easily, it’s over. Isario laughs in self-mockery. He couldn’t even break through it as well as the word.  But I guess he’s telling himself that he had broken through it.  </p>
<p>『So he’ll win by himself in the end?』</p>
<p>「... I’m sure that this incident has greatly reduced the power of the Abyss Eater.  If you expose him to the world, the world will surely be destroyed.  It’s not a good way to say it, but it has helped make a difference for the world. So, I have no choice but to think that way」</p>
<p>『Well, you’re right...  Besides, we’ve lost Juanaverta, so it can’t be said that we won』</p>
<p> I can’t say we won』</p>
<p>  As I sighed and sighed, I saw someone running toward us.  </p>
<p>「Isario, Fran! Are you okay!?」</p>
<p>「The girls too, are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Indeed!」</p>
<p>  It seemed that the others were able to move too.  It has been agitated since the ball-shaped fall attack, but everyone seemed to be alive. They all gathered naturally in the presence of Isario.  They were all tatters. Even the armor worn by Orfalve by the dwarves was covered with holes. Sophie was brought by Urushi and Ashwrath was carried by two adventurers, and they had not woken up yet.  And the number of them had also decreased. Even so, the giant antidemons were defeated and the crisis was over. Many were mourning the deaths while biting their victory.  Also, the Holy Nation was no longer in sight.  Apparently, they retreated on their own. Well, it wouldn’t have been of any use to those guys without Adors, so I’m glad to hear that......  We’re trying to leave, but that’s not enough to “ goodbye” to them. This army has been investigating the anomaly in the antidemons since the very beginning.  Orfalve and Isario, the relatively well-rested Militant Nation of Hagane, and the knight chief of Silard, Seliadot, who seemed to know what’s going on, were gathered to discuss the future. It would be quickest if we could talk to Trismegistus, but they were hostile for now.  Well, I don’t think they were concerned about that at all, but there was always the chance.Well, I don’t think he was concerned about that at all, but there was a chance.  Or rather, there was a possibility that he might suddenly fight for a reason that we didn’t understand.  And once the goal was achieved, he would again say that it was a “rite of passage”, without any malice or good intentions.  Trismegistus really didn’t like me.  If possible, he just didn’t want to see me for a while. We need time to accept this feeling.  I’m sure Fran hated him even more than me.  Even though she didn’t directly touch him, she was probably involved in many people’s deaths and tried to destroy me.  I wouldn’t be so bad as to say something like, </p>
<p>「I won’t forgive you.  I’ll take my life to kill you!」</p>
<p> But I was sure she hated him enough to make me feel angry when she looked at his face.  As I was thinking about this, Fran and Isario suddenly looked up to the sky.Then, the light suddenly fell.</p>
