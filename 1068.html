</div><h1>Chapter 1068</h1><p>The demon knight continued to lose his balance as his right arm and right feather were cut off.</p>
<p>Fran then launched another barrage.</p>
<p>「This little girl is...!」</p>
<p>「Yeah!」</p>
<p>「Damn! This! Get away from me!」</p>
<p>「Teyaa!」</p>
<p>The wounds on the demon knights immediately begin to regenerate. As happened in their possessed state, the regeneration inhibition of life magic was not working properly. It may not work well against antidemons, demons, and other non-pure lifeforms.</p>
<p>But there was no problem. Fran sliced through her limbs and wings before she could complete her regeneration and regain her stance.</p>
<p>Because of the perfect timing, the demon knights were unable to regain their balance. In the end, they fall into the forest with their cones at the center.</p>
<p>When I thought I heard the sound of branches and leaves snapping, a loud crushing sound echoed through the air. It seemed that the sound had crashed into the tree trunk without being able to completely kill its momentum.</p>
<p>The sound of cracking the tree trunks combined with the bones of the demon knights probably emitted an unpleasant sound.</p>
<p>Fran reached the falling point and found a man lying on the ground. He had lost his right, left, and feathers, and was vomiting a lot of blood from his mouth. The huge tree that seemed to have collided was crushed in the middle and collapsed on the side.</p>
<p>Having lost almost all of my magic power, I didn’t seem to be able to start regenerating. There was only a few life force left, so I felt like I was just barely alive.</p>
<p>After lightly stopping her limbs, Fran began to interrogate them.</p>
<p>「Who are you?」</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>「What is your name? By “demon” are you from Philias? Or are you from Raydoss?」</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>He looked like a knight and seemed to be very talkative. Besides, he was not the type to lie properly, but the type to keep their mouths shut.</p>
<p>After all, the Principal of Falsehoods didn’t seem to work on this. She was kinda surprised when the man made such a quick decision.</p>
<p>「Kill them.」</p>
<p>「Understood!」</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>To my surprise, the man’s head exploded. And at the same time, his left chest swelled from the inside out.</p>
<p>『He just killed himself.』</p>
<p>「Nn...」</p>
<p>It seems the demon had destroyed the man’s head and heart from within. I thought it took a lot of effort to disable him without killing him, but...</p>
<p>When I appraised my body again, all I could remember was the name Rayus and a few skills about the demon.</p>
<p>Even after examining her belongings, no one showed any signs of belongings. The demon seemed to have killed the man, but it could not detect his presence either.</p>
<p>I didn’t even know if he was still inside this corpse or not. I tried to stow it away for now, but I was able to do so...</p>
<p>「Let’s go to the village」</p>
<p>『Yeah, they don’t seem to have much more information to give us. Our fight with this guy had definitely exposed him, so let’s be careful』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>We tried to hide our presence as much as possible and headed for the village of Metelmam. On the way, we couldn’t sense any enemies. It was possible that the troops of the Kingdom of Raidos were occupier, but they didn’t seem to have any sentries.</p>
<p>Was he careless that the demon knights could not lose?</p>
<p>They easily arrived at the village area, but I didn’t notice anything strange. There was no sign of anyone coming from the houses. Like Dards, I wondered if they had taken us somewhere else.</p>
<p>When I searched more extensively, I noticed that people were gathered at the back of the village. They were running through the village steadily and heading there.</p>
<p>(...Are they Raydoss’s soldiers?)</p>
<p>『Yeah, what’s with this way of death...?』</p>
<p>A group of men, who seemed to be Raydoss soldiers, had collapsed on the street. I checked them and found that they were already dead. However, I wondered how they died.</p>
<p>I found three corpses. But they were all in a different state.</p>
<p>One of them had purple spots all over his body and anguished expressions on his face. He was clearly being killed by an instant poison.</p>
<p>The other two were traumatized, but their contents were much different. One of them was slain from the shoulder, and their internal organs were off.</p>
<p>However, the other one had multiple twists on the lower half of his torso, which made him look strange as if he were in a Colone state. From his pained expression, it was easy to tell that he was in this state alive.</p>
<p>Poison, slash, mysterious power... Just when there were three people in this village who were capable of doing this, huh? Well, I guess we can kill them in the same way as before. That demon knight may have been able to do the latter two too.</p>
<p>But if the demon knight had defeated the Raidos army, why didn’t they let Fran go into the village?</p>
<p>The Kingdom of Raidos controlled the village and took it back by the Kingdom of Philias, who was aiming for the interests of the fishers. However, I think Kranzel and Philias were friendly countries...</p>
<p>While I was thinking about it, Fran had reached her destination.</p>
<p>Apparently, it was a place like a gathering place. Well, on a large field without a roof, but more than a hundred people were being captured and rolled over.</p>
<p>They seemed to be restraining only the men’s limbs, and the women’s and children’s hands. They also seemed to be exhausted. Is it true that those who clearly don’t look like villagers are adventurers?</p>
<p>Not only that, but they also seemed to have captured bandits in the vicinity. They were filthy for the villagers, but their equipment was smaller than that of the other adventurers.</p>
<p>I couldn’t find any people from the Kingdom of Raidos in the square. Instead, I could tell that there were three people in the square.</p>
<p>One of them, perhaps a guard for the captives, was standing on the Neidhart at the entrance of the audience. He looked like a person on the outside, but his armor looked just like the demon knight we fought earlier. Maybe he’s similar too.</p>
<p>The only problem was further back. They were probably two people in the center of the plaza. A young man and woman with beautiful blonde hair. We were both familiar with them.</p>
<p>(Frut and Satya?)</p>
<p>『Yeah, it’s gotta be him』</p>
<p>With a difficult look on their faces, they were discussing something with each other. The royals of the Kingdom of Philias and Fran’s friend, Princess Fran.</p>
