</div><h1>Chapter 1067</h1><p>「Use my mana and my body as the sacrifice, to materialize it! Wind magic!」</p>
<p> Immediately after the demon knight shouted, the magic around him had changed. Not only had it increased and strengthened, but it had become so intense that it looked like a storm itself. Its wings were also getting bigger and had a long tail with the tips like a claw. </p>
<p>「It’s been a while since I’ve had such a bad experience.」</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>「Little girl! It’s thanks to you resisting me! I’ll be grateful! As thanks, I’ll kill you without pain!」</p>
<p> As thanks, I’ll kill you this time!」</p>
<p> The demon knight shouted in a shrill voice that looked nothing like before and threw magic at us.  </p>
<p>「Shatter it up!  Hyahahaha!」</p>
<p>  It was a wind bullet that spun around like a tornado. Indeed, it was so powerful that a normal human would be able to shatter it.  When I appraised it again, I found that its race had changed from a demon to a demon. Not only did it possess it, but it seemed to have transformed from a physical one.  Although there was almost no change in skills, its status had been significantly enhanced. Most of his stats were over 500, and his magic power was over a thousand.  His title had also increased to Demon Lord.  With his demonization, he was probably able to unleash magic without chanting. He then waved his arms in rapid succession and began to scatter wind bullets.  </p>
<p>「Ora ora ora!」</p>
<p>「I can’t get a hit from that!」</p>
<p> However, Fran dodged his attack and intercepted only the ones that might hit her.  </p>
<p>「Hah?  What the hell is that!?  You’ve sliced through my wind!」</p>
<p>「It’s my turn now!」</p>
<p>『Doryaaa!』</p>
<p>  Fran unleashed a series of thunder spells, and I unleashed a series of flame spells. Magic struck us from all directions, hitting the demon one after another. But we didn’t let out a shout of joy.  </p>
<p>「It hurts! There’s no need to block magic this weak!」</p>
<p>『Tsk!  It has a high magic defense!』</p>
<p>  Even though it was a low-level magic for wait-and-see magic, it didn’t even give us a simple defense and I didn’t expect it to be ignored. It was a defense that was beyond my imagination.  I understood that an attack with the </p>
<p>「It’s my turn now!」</p>
<p>  point would not hit it, and this time it was an attack with lines. It was a transparent wind scythe, very hard to see.  Countless wind scythes were released and attacked Fran from all sides. If she was an adventurer on par with her, her entire body would have been cut apart, making her the end of the tunnel.  However, Fran did not panic and sensed the scythes, and she saw their trajectory and dealt with them.  </p>
<p>「How can I see this!  Uwaah! Die, die, die!」</p>
<p>「Don’t die!」</p>
<p>「Oruaaah!」</p>
<p>「Haaah!」</p>
<p>  From there, it was a fierce battle of magic.  We scattered fierce magic to each other. The wind magic on the other side was intercepted by Fran and me, and our magic was blocked by the other side’s high magic defense.  To break through the defense, they would need to have higher-level skills. However, because both of them move too fast, it was difficult to target them.  Besides, even if we could hit Kanna Kamui and the like, that might defeat them.Besides, even if we could get a Kanna Kamui or something, that might defeat them.  We haven’t given up on using them as live captures yet.  </p>
<p>(Master, what is that magic power?)</p>
<p>『It’s starting to dwindle considerably』</p>
<p>  It seemed that even in the middle of the demon’s manifestation, it was constantly draining magic power, and the magic power of the demon knights was slowly decreasing. Fran seemed to be planning to continue the battle and aim for a complete loss of mana.  The demon knight seemed to be getting annoyed by this turn of events.  He shouted as he flew around.  </p>
<p>「Uwaah!  Uwaah! That’s gonna turn into a punch!」</p>
<p>  Was he even moving his hand to form a kind of seal?  He was too far off to know the details, but―― There was no doubt that he had done something. The wind and mana surrounding the demon knights had become even stronger. They rotated like a drill as they swirled around the sky at the speed of a fighter. The wind spear had a tracking feature.  On the other hand, Fran, clad in black lightning, dodged with acrobatic movements while using the air as a foothold.  </p>
<p>『Kuh!  This one is! Strict!』</p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>『Fran!  Dodge! I can dodge if I intercept you!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  The slashed spear of wind caused a huge explosion and blew Fran away.  If she hadn’t teleported and escaped as quickly as possible, she would have taken heavy damage from the even more damage caused by the rushed spear.  </p>
<p>『Fran! Are you going to hold back just yet!?』</p>
<p>  We wanted to get close and get closer, but the one that didn’t approached was not. We knew that Fran had the advantage in a slash.  However, a shoot from a distance would not be a easy one to hit. So, shouldn’t we get as close to him as we can?  </p>
<p>(Don’t worry!)</p>
<p>  Fran nodded confidently and descended from the spot at once.Fran nodded confidently and descended from the spot.  Even though she lowered her altitude, she ran off with her back away from the demon knights. </p>
<p>「W-Wait a minute! Don’t ignore me!」</p>
<p>(Take this!)</p>
<p>『Yeah!』</p>
<p> No matter how high your ability is, you won’t be able to deal with someone who is passionate about it!  Fran rushed toward the demon knight who was chasing after her at super high speed. She hurriedly fired her wind spear at him, but as long as she got the right timing, she could dodge it easily.  Fran activated the Black Lightning Roll for a brief moment and passed the wind spear. She was already close enough to the opponent to reach her hand.  </p>
<p>「What!?」</p>
<p>  The surprised demon knight and Fran had led the way in this situation on their own.I saw a demon knight slain off his right arm and right blade as he fell, looking like a cone.</p>
