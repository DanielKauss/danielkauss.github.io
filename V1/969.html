</div><h1>Chapter 969</h1><p>『I see it! It’s a giant!』</p>
<p>「The town is......」</p>
<p>「Woof...」</p>
<p>The target finally appeared in front of the second unit, which continued to move despite taking several breaks.</p>
<p>A huge antidemon stood up and rampaged within the walls of the town, the illegal city of Satte. It looked like a huge high-rise building and could even climb over the walls of the town. I don’t think it was 200 meters tall, but... It was so huge that I couldn’t get an accurate size.</p>
<p>In contrast to the town, it was probably about the size of a child standing in a swimming pool.</p>
<p>Of course, it was not an opponent that those soldiers and adventurers could compete with.</p>
<p>The sight of her huge body, which far exceeded my imagination, spreading destruction everywhere was more impressive than I had imagined.</p>
<p>Knights and adventurers, who were supposed to be elites of their choice, gasped and paused.</p>
<p>But Isario and Fran were not frightened at all. Isario was sighing with the same carefree attitude as ever.</p>
<p>「Umm, I guess those guys are gonna be broken bones.」</p>
<p>I was worried that the adventurers might cling to the weak words of the Rank S adventurers, but it seemed the opposite was the case. I could see the adventurers calm down when I saw Isario’s change in appearance.</p>
<p>「This time, I’ll take it down.」</p>
<p>「Grr!」</p>
<p>Fran and Urushi were both incredibly motivated. They had enough fighting spirit and ready to fight to win the hearts of everyone around them. Fran’s attitude also helped to calm down the adventurers.</p>
<p>Isario and Fran. Seeing how reliable their top two were, they had completely regained their will to fight. Their expressions have changed completely.</p>
<p>They may be just bracing themselves, but they are good at just regaining their motivation.</p>
<p>Also, General Hagane was as usual. The old soldiers were surprisingly calm, and even in the face of the giants, they did not feel a trace of fear.</p>
<p>The same went for the hydrangeas that came down from the carriage. They looked up at the giant-type with a smile on their faces.</p>
<p>「Well, what should we do now? How about some of that?」</p>
<p>「This time, we will need to work with the adventurers. Whether or not you will be able to move will depend on the evacuation situation for the people of town」</p>
<p>The guardess seemed to be a bitch. Not only was her face, but her voice was very similar to that of the commander. Maybe these two were sisters to her.</p>
<p>I mean, this situation is pretty bad huh?</p>
<p>Both Isario’s Ignis and Hagane’s Berserk were idiots about the damage to the surrounding area. It would be difficult to use against the giant-types in the town.</p>
<p>That’s why Fran will have to do her best. How well will the adventurers and knights fight against that huge antidemon......?</p>
<p>The old soldiers of Hagane were also raring for a fight, but I doubt it would be so easy to beat that giant-type. Basically, the soldiers would use long-range attacks to guide them out of the city and launch Fran’s moves.</p>
<p>「What should we do?」</p>
<p>「They check up on someone as big as a young miss and guide him with a long-range attack from outside the wall. We dragged him out of the wall and threw him in there, I guess?」</p>
<p>「It’s fine with Isario-dono’s strategy. Let us join in the long-range attack too.」</p>
<p>The kid nodded and explained the equipment and skills of the old soldiers. He said that some of them could use magic, and even if they couldn’t, they were still training their bows. Indeed, they all possessed archery and archery skills.</p>
<p>Because of this, it was possible to hit them at a considerable distance. It was not without confidence, but as if she said it was only natural for her to be able to do so.</p>
<p>「Will that work for the girls too?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「I want you to take care of the checkers. Are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Okay」</p>
<p>「It’s a long way ahead, so I’d prefer to stay as tireless as possible.」</p>
<p>Isario was right. If we’re done here, we can go all out. But this is not the end of the battle.</p>
<p>As long as there was still a fight between the other giant types after this, we couldn’t use all of our power here.</p>
<p>「At any rate, we would like to move the wall and the giant-type to the closest position」</p>
<p>「Yeah」</p>
<p>Even though they were confident in their range, they could not target us from a distance of more than a kilometer.</p>
<p>The upper limit is said to be about 500 meters if we want to get a guaranteed hit.</p>
<p>So, we decided to start by looking for the closest place between the giant-type and the city wall. We followed the city wall and passed around the illegal city.</p>
<p>I couldn’t sense any people in the walls. I would be glad if they had escaped, but if that wasn’t the case, there seemed to be a lot of damage.</p>
<p>「Hmm. The giant has seen me.」</p>
<p>「Arf.」</p>
<p>『You noticed that?』</p>
<p>The giant-type gazed at us. He was obviously aware of the presence of the second unit.</p>
<p>「The atmosphere of the big monster has changed」</p>
<p>「You’re coming here?」</p>
<p>If we chased after this unit, we would have less trouble provoking them, but......</p>
<p>「Ruoooooogh!」</p>
<p>「The giants are still moving! Be wary of them!」</p>
<p>But it was right after you warned me.</p>
<p>I saw something with a huge mass flying from the direction where the giant was. It was the roof of a house. It had also been removed from the house under its feet and thrown.</p>
<p>Isario was about to unleash his magic, but before he could, we were already moving.</p>
<p>『Fran!』</p>
<p>「Nn! I’ll do it!」</p>
<p>Fran jumped up to store the rubble.</p>
<p>「Young miss, that’s impressive!」</p>
<p>「Nn. I’ll take care of the ones flying! Please attack him!」</p>
<p>「Understood!」</p>
<p>Fran took care of the defense and Hilt took care of the command. It was a lot different from the original plan, but the second unit’s battle has begun.</p>
<p>「Hey young miss! I’ll knock her out of the ring. Don’t worry about the back.」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
