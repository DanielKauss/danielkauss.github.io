</div><h1>Chapter 1058</h1><p>The day after we destroyed Barbra’s Raydoss fleet, we were heading north along the coast toward Dards.</p>
<p>There were several fishing villages along the way, but they were not even aware of the strange occurrence. They were somewhat suspicious of the fact that no merchant came to buy fish in the fishing village closest to Barbra.</p>
<p>However, further north, they lived their usual lives, unaware that the Raidos Kingdom had begun its invasion.</p>
<p>The Raidos Kingdom fleet must have used a route that could not be found by the residents of the fishing villages to prevent them from being distracted by the strange occurrence.</p>
<p>In a port town a little larger than the village, they had finally received information about the anomaly and were making moves to prepare for it. It would take some more time for the information to reach the surrounding fishing villages.</p>
<p>Well, having told them that Barbra had been attacked in each fishing village, they were probably sent to the town by now.</p>
<p>From there, we went further along the coast to near the port town of Dahz. As expected, in the fishing village next to Dahz, we were aware of the anomaly and were able to get a lot of information about it.</p>
<p>Darz was originally close to the Raidos Kingdom, so he seemed to have been prepared in his own way. Immediately after the defense fleet was defeated, messengers were sent to the surrounding villages to tell them to evacuate.</p>
<p>I heard that many people had already evacuated to inland towns.</p>
<p>Still, the only people left in the village were old people who refused to evacuate. They said that it was ridiculous to abandon the village and run away, and they didn’t ask Fran to evacuate.</p>
<p>On the contrary, he was worried about Fran going to Dars and gave her some potions.</p>
<p>『Fran, what’s wrong?』</p>
<p>「......Are those old men okay?」</p>
<p>『They seemed to have food to eat too, but I guess we won’t get good food if Raydoss soldiers come』</p>
<p>If Fran was too concerned about it, I could have forced her to just jump in and bring her to town. But I didn’t know if she wanted to leave the village or not.</p>
<p>Even if we forced them to rescue, they might just make them lose their purpose and live carefree. Is that what makes them happy? But better than better than dead?</p>
<p>It was a difficult problem. However, Fran seemed to have decided to respect their will.</p>
<p>「Darz, he said it was already occupied.」</p>
<p>『Well, I don’t know what we can do if the fleet is destroyed. There are only a few adventurers after all』</p>
<p>「 Charlotte and the others, are you okay?」</p>
<p>『I’ve managed to get quite a lot of people out of here, and I hope they can get in.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>But in this case, Charlotte and the others were sent to Dards as a representative of Barbra. They would not be able to refuse if asked to cooperate in the defense.</p>
<p>It was very likely that they were participating in the battle against the Kingdom of Raidos.</p>
<p>「First, let’s check out what’s going on in the town」</p>
<p>『Yeah. If we’re going to report to a nearby town, we need to check the size of our enemy fleet and the number of soldiers we have』</p>
<p>It might be better to wait for the night, but that would make it harder to check the enemy’s lineup. There were some risks, but we decided to scout out Dars from the sky for the time being.</p>
<p>We ascended at once as we headed for Dars. Urushi’s black seems to stand out on the sunny sky, so he must have disguised himself properly.</p>
<p>While using illusion magic to project the sky around us, I also used light magic camouflage to blend in with the surrounding scenery.</p>
<p>Although it was not completely invisible, it was probably disguised as a simple optical camouflage. If we hadn’t stared very carefully at the sky, we should have been able to avoid being spotted.</p>
<p>It was supposed to be, but......</p>
<p>「Kyuiii!」</p>
<p>「Kyukyui!」</p>
<p>「There’s a lot of big beasts!」</p>
<p>『It’s Lesser rock!』</p>
<p>Three giants were flying around us. They were about two meters long and had wings that were probably about ten meters long.</p>
<p>It was the magic beast with a threat level of D, Lesser rock. It was not very powerful in combat, but it seemed to have excellent detection power enough to detect our disguise.</p>
<p>They must be working for the Raidos Kingdom. Anyway, once they were found, it would be difficult to hide anymore. In the first place, they were found on the ground because they surrounded us.</p>
<p>「I’m sorry, Master」</p>
<p>『Well, it can’t be helped then! Don’t worry about it! More importantly, let’s take them down!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>While we were scouting from above, we witnessed about 30 adventurers being taken to Dahz, where the wounds of the battle had remained and the corpses of soldiers and adventurers were left unattended everywhere.</p>
<p>Apparently, we were on our way from the harbor to the ship. The leader of the line had already stepped foot into the harbor.</p>
<p>Among them were Judith, Maia, and Lydia, the Scarlet Maidens, and Judith the Half-Insect kin. All of them were covered with wounds and shackles. Besides, if they were to walk a little slower, they would be poked from behind.</p>
<p>Fran, who had witnessed this, unintentionally unleashed her killing intent, and as a result, the Lesser Stones, who were wary of the sky, were discovered here.</p>
<p>It was only for a moment. They must have been used for security because they had such high detection abilities that they could even notice it.</p>
<p>『Urushi! I’ll leave one of them in the back!』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「I’ll do it right!」</p>
<p>『Then I’m on your left!』</p>
<p>We released our concealment and attacked Lesser rock. It was a rather troublesome opponent with a big speed and sharp senses, but it was not our enemy now.</p>
<p>The winner was over in an instant. Urushi’s fangs had gouged out his head, and Fran’s slashes and my thunder magic killed each other they were aiming for.</p>
<p>But the problem was just after this. They looked down while stowing away the corpse of Lesser rock. The harbor was filled with Raidos soldiers to try and save everyone.</p>
<p>『What now? Should we leave for now and dive back in at night? I’ve found it completely.』</p>
<p>(Then I might have been brought in somewhere! I’ll help you now!)</p>
<p>『Wha, Fran! Could it be, you want us to just run straight to the harbor!?』</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
<p>There’s a lot of Raidos soldiers in the harbor right now! Are you going to rush in there!?</p>
<p>『Just tell Gamudo not to be reckless and answer me okay!』</p>
<p>「Nn! I’ll blow all the enemies away, so no problem!」</p>
<p>『So that means it’s my turn.』</p>
<p>She had overestimated Fran’s hostility towards Raydoss!</p>
<p>I knew it was powerful, but to think it was a failed divine sword!</p>
<p>Even if we had to hide our figure and wait for the night, things would not necessarily improve. In fact, it would be quite difficult to rescue a large number of people from the ship. So, it might be better to rescue them even if we had no choice but to.</p>
<p>In the end, which one to choose had advantages and disadvantages. If that was the case, it might be better for her to fight here because she could maintain Fran’s motivation.</p>
<p>「Master, thank you」</p>
<p>『Let’s not let our guard down!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
