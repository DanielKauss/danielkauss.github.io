</div><h1>Chapter 1131</h1><p>The Genoside Ghouls suddenly began to worship Fran with “My priestess!”</p>
<p>「......Are you going to obey me?」</p>
<p>「Of course! God has ordered you to obey! I will obey all orders of his! If you want to perish, then destroy!」</p>
<p>『I’m not lying.』</p>
<p>For these evil-minded beastmen, the revelation from the Evil God Fragment was exactly what an oracle was supposed to be.</p>
<p>「What are you guys?」</p>
<p>「I’m sorry for that pathetic death.」</p>
<p>Though she was a little tired of interrogation, we managed to get some information out of her by persistently talking to her.</p>
<p>This ghoul’s name was Avenger. It seems to be the trump card of the Black Skeleton Corps, created using Nameless of the Black Skeleton Army and the special abilities of the undead known as the Holy Mother.</p>
<p>It was an undead created by gathering thousands of grudges, and was said to have been infused with evil energy by the necromancy of the Evil God’s admirer, Onslaught.</p>
<p>Apparently, the ruined Miranleil Fort was not actually destroyed, but there was an evil research facility underground. The rumors had been spread to hide that fact.</p>
<p>However, they were attracted by the presence of the Divine Attributes and had come so far.</p>
<p>Avenger’s mouth told us about the terrifying internal situation in the Kingdom of Raidos.</p>
<p>We already knew that the Kingdom of Raidos was recruiting illegal slaves, but their use was really terrible.</p>
<p>First of all, many illegal slaves bought by the Southern and Western Dukes were subjects of inhumane experiments, and even if they survived, they were considered ritual sacrifices. The content of this ritual may be the production of magic swords, the control of magic beasts, and so on.</p>
<p>And death was not the end.</p>
<p>Human dignity was not taken into account at all, and every corner of her body was used to its limit. Even that hatred of Raidos was used to make undead and curse the Great Magic Beast.</p>
<p>I could even feel a kind of obsession over the complete exhaustion of human beings.</p>
<p>It seems that this thought came from the time when Raidos was only seen by adventurers. As a result of the various factors such as war, fright, and damage to magic beasts, the most excess resources in the Raidos Kingdom at that time were people.</p>
<p>The Kingdom of Raidos allocated the idle personnel to all sides, and forced forward with the development, development, and increase of production.</p>
<p>They would suddenly send amateurs for reclamation or defense. Naturally, many people died as if they were hot water, but the Raidos Kingdom did not stop them from deploying people. It was as if they were talking down, but surprisingly, there were few grievings or resentment among the people.</p>
<p>Because it was a hegemonic country with an internal war as its national creed, many citizens were at the same time soldiers, and they willingly went to death for the sake of the country. It was a voluntary act of abandoning, but it was considered natural in Raidos at that time, when brainwashing education was still widespread.</p>
<p>It was also common for soldiers who had lost their limbs and could no longer fight to volunteer themselves for various kinds of research experiments.</p>
<p>Such a tendency to consider people as an inexpensive source and excessive patriotism due to brainwashing education remained within the Raidos Kingdom for a long time, and gradually began to distort.</p>
<p>Originally, the people of Gordicia volunteered themselves to serve the country, but now they were aware that they would die if the country so wanted, and the psychological barrier to sacrifice people for the country’s interests itself had dropped significantly.</p>
<p>And now, all that was left was a convenient thought for the Raidos Kingdom, such as allowing them to use illegal slaves from other countries for inhumane research.</p>
<p>The reason why Avenger’s tone was laced with hatred was probably because of the hatred that was mixed in with it.</p>
<p>Originally, Avengers were created out of resentment for Raidos, and they had a great dislike for the Raidos Kingdom. However, due to the control of both the saintess and onslaught, they were enslaved without even doubting it.</p>
<p>But apparently, his hatred for Raydoss had been revived when his control was canceled by the Evil God Fragment.</p>
<p>「I’ve been ordered to scatter poison all over the Kingdom of Kranzel, but I don’t care anymore! On the contrary, let’s not let Raydoss rot!」</p>
<p>Now that you mention it, they had the worst and best abilities for war use. They moved so quickly that ordinary adventurers could not catch up with them and scattered a large amount of super-powerful poisons.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is said that there are various poisons to choose from, and some of them are dangerous, such as making land and water sources unusable for several years.</p>
<p>How should I put it, they were destructive agents who could use lethal chemical weapons indefinitely? Simple slaughter capabilities might not even match Nameless or the Lich.</p>
<p>He said that it was a secret technique of the counterattack that was currently created using almost all of the various resources that the Southern Duke had accumulated during the counterattack on the Kingdom of Kranzel.</p>
<p>The Southern Duke’s secret technique then bowed his head to Fran and blurted out his inner feelings.</p>
<p>「So the Black Skeleton Army really doesn’t have much strength anymore?」</p>
<p>「Yes. They still have their top brass, but they still have the power to defend their flag in each region」</p>
<p>「How many top brass do you have?」</p>
<p>「It is the first seat with the head of the family, Nameless the “Skiller Slayer”. The second seat, the “Saintess”. Wickerman in the third seat, Iceman in the fourth seat, Chardman in the fifth seat, and Hydeman in the sixth seat, Shadow.」</p>
<p>They told us about their abilities, but I guess the most interesting thing about them was Hydman. His ability to infiltrate was troublesome. However, it seemed to be not easy to prepare a body that was compatible with it, with only two of them left as far as Avenger knew.</p>
<p>As we were trying to figure out her intentions, Avenger spoke a few words that we couldn’t let her hear.</p>
<p>「If they are targeting their top brass, we are currently working on a mission across that mountain. We are intercepting the troops of the Kranzel Kingdom」</p>
<p>「!! Please let me know more about that」</p>
<p>「Yeah!」</p>
