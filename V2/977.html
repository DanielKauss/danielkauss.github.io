</div><h1>Chapter 977</h1><p>The second unit, which had defeated the super giant-type, tried to enter the town of Shoulds, but in the end, they had no choice but to give up. A large number of antidemons were wandering around the town. There was no sign of any living people, so they had completely collapsed. Moreover, we were now bringing in some refugees from the sates, and the best forces, Isario and Mastelier, were worn out and in tatters. We couldn’t do anything rash. It seems that the Dragon King set up a magic circle here as well, but it was too wide to be searched for in a short time. We’ll have to leave it alone this time. We’ll have to leave it alone this time. </p>
<p>「You, what do you think?」</p>
<p>「I had originally planned to go further west of here and head for the town of Barhar...」</p>
<p>「That giant-type from earlier came from the west」</p>
<p>「That’s right.  It is possible that that giant-type came from Barhar...」</p>
<p> However, we could not determine that it was exterminated just by guessing it.  We decided to head to Barhar first. If it was safe, we would leave the residents of the Sanatorium with them, and if it was destroyed, we would head for the nearest town from there.  That would be the most safe way to go.  The only problem was not the giant-type that came from Barhar, but the one that had still been attacked by the giant-type. Isario and the others had to go into battle while they were not in top form. The blue cat was saying that she was going to let Berserk go, but that didn’t mean Fran was going to stare at the wagon running side by side.  She must have been thinking the same thing as me. There was a deep feeling of melancholy in his eyes.  </p>
<p>(... Master.  If there’s a giant-type beast, I’ll definitely take them down by ourselves.  Without a doubt.)</p>
<p>『...... Are you sure?』</p>
<p>(Nn.  Without a doubt.)</p>
<p>  Fran seemed to be determined. It would be dangerous to have Isario use her Divine Sword any more, and I knew that if you use the Divine Sword Release, no one would be in any danger. Fran seemed to think that as long as she could defeat the Giant-type, no one would be in any danger. As for me, I’d like to say that Fran is in danger, but my resolve won’t change anymore.  </p>
<p>『...First, I’m not sure if there’s a giant-type in the town of Bahar』</p>
<p>(Nn)</p>
<p> The second unit was heading to Barhar with great worry and impatience, but they were very slow because of the refugees from Sarte.  They were ordinary citizens, so they didn’t have the strength, and they were exhausted on the way so far.  Moreover, they were frequently attacked by antidemons. Even if they wanted to increase their speed, it was impossible to speed up the torn steps of the exhausted refugees. It couldn’t be helped that it would take us more than twice as long a day’s journey alone.  Besides, the people of the Sanatorium were quite patient as we could see.  They didn’t have bedding, no changing clothes, and didn’t take many breaks.  They didn’t complain on such roads.  But I don’t know if they would do the same for the future. I was a little worried about my food.  Thanks to the magicians, I could manage to get some water, but I couldn’t produce food. The residents had taken some of it with them, but they were not enough to cover all of them.  On the first day, I shared the food with the troops, but it was almost at the limit. In the first place, we didn’t have enough food for the troops.  However, we cannot reduce the number of food for the fighters too much. If anyone who can fight gets hungry becomes hungry, they will not be able to protect the refugees.  However, they would also be annoyed if only our fighters were to eat next to their stomachs. If this continued, the atmosphere of the troops would surely deteriorate.  This would be quite bad if they can’t replenish their supplies in Barhar. Well, unless they have dimensional storage for me and Fran.  By using meat alone, they have enough food for a thousand people for a few days. But if we want to feed this many people, where should I pay for it later?  Will the council give us the bill?  I’m worried that we’re not officially treated as residents since Sainte is an illegal city. Well, I’m not going to let them die from starvation, and I’m sure Fran won’t mind if it comes to it.  But if they become reputed for serving food for free, some people will try to gather for them, especially on this continent. Especially on this continent.  That would be troublesome then. </p>
<p>『It would be best if we could get some food in Barhar.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p> Actually, it would have been nice if we could get some food in Shoulds, but it was too big for us to find any of their food storage. In the first place, we had too many antidemons to explore at all. We arrived at Barhar in two more days, while saving a little food.  The plains were unobstructed, so even though it was unobstructed, the devastation in Barhar came to our eyes. Just like the sates and shoals, some of the walls had been destroyed, clearly attacked by the giant-types.  The giant-type was no longer in existence, but we could feel the presence of countless antidemons from behind the wall.  No matter how I looked at it, it was not safe. </p>
<p>「You, what’s the plan?」</p>
<p>「I’m happy that there’s no giant-type, but... I don’t think we can take a break in that town.  But securing food is an urgent need.」</p>
<p>「Nn.  Will you come back to see us then?」</p>
<p>「Can you do this for us? If we don’t find it, we’ll be relying on Black Lightning Princess-dono, but in that case, our country will pay you」</p>
<p>  Actually, we had already discussed it with you last night. I told her that I could do something about the meat of a high-ranking magic beast to her, as she was in a hurry to secure food.  Then she didn’t tell her to pay for it for free and promised to pay for it. It would be quite expensive for the meat of a high-ranking magic beast, but she smiled that it would be cheap to buy a reputation.  Half of it was true.  But our reputation had been increased enough by the protection of the people of the Sante.  Half of it was probably because she was caring for Fran. They made it possible for her to provide food without hesitation.  The Militant Nation of Hagane was quite decent, no matter how much we don’t compare to Silard. They’d consider our convenience as well.  </p>
<p>(Master, let’s go.)</p>
<p>『Yeah, let’s look for some food around these big facilities.I’d say half of it was true. But our reputation had been raised enough by the fact that we had protected the people of Silard. Half of it was probably more concerned for Fran. They made it possible for her to provide food without hesitation. The Militant Nation of Hagane was quite decent, no matter how much we compare to Silard. They’d consider our convenience as well. </p>
<p>(Master, let’s go.)</p>
<p>『Yeah, let’s look for some food around these big facilities. I’ll be lucky if they’ve stockpiled it somewhere.』</p>
