</div><h1>Chapter 1091</h1><p>After refusing the invasion from the Kingdom of Shallus, Fran and Urushi returned to Barbra for now.</p>
<p>Now we are waiting for the reaction of the Kingdom of Shallus by sending a emissary. The summons we have collected have already been shattered into pieces, but Gamudo is in control of them. They must look into the opportunity and leave them with the government.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Fran was helping with the reconstruction of Barbra.</p>
<p>Fran was concerned about Alessa, but she couldn’t let Barbra go too. We also got information that Alessa’s defense was going well. It seemed that they had gathered former A-ranked adventurers and pushed them back quite a bit.</p>
<p>Fran, who didn’t have to go to Alessa forcibly, was now cooking in Barbra and cleaning up the rubble. The other thing we needed to do now was to eliminate the presences of those between us and the Raidos Kingdom.</p>
<p>Perhaps he wanted to get a lot of information, but Derick’s men had infiltrated Barbra several times already. Well, it would be difficult to deceive Fran and Urushi’s eyes if they were wary of him coming, and Fermus and Diaz were now among them. The fact that they were in between was eliminated immediately.</p>
<p>At that time, she was able to use the “owl’s eye” and “Intercept” skills that were obtained from the magic stone soldiers. The skill “owl’s eye” could be seen clearly at night. It seemed to be better at kinetic vision than night vision.</p>
<p>As the name suggested, this skill made it easier to distinguish the sounds of surrounding areas. This was very useful for searching for people in between.</p>
<p>After all, we had defeated all of them, but there were only three new skills. Well, it couldn’t be helped though, since most of the magic stone soldiers were just skilled in martial arts, martial arts, and magic.</p>
<p>Most of them already had their skills.</p>
<p>The other one was the skill called “Metal Flexible”. It seemed to have many uses for this too. Right now, it’s come in handy for repairing distorted metal doors.</p>
<p>Thanks in part to Fran and Urushi’s efforts, Barbra had been able to regain her composure lately.</p>
<p>I’ve seen him a few times already, but he hadn’t suffered any major invasions either. Once the navy was destroyed, he probably wouldn’t be able to attack us easily.</p>
<p>Better than before, we didn’t have to move around from morning till night, and we were about to try something.</p>
<p>『Then, let’s give it a try』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran’s room, given to her by the guild. Under the light of the lanterns hanging from the ceiling, Fran was seriously looking at the multiple small bags placed on the table.</p>
<p>These were item bags that we had acquired in various places in the past. Some were taken from goblins, others from the hideouts of slavers.</p>
<p>We had heard that she could use arcane magic to forcibly open it, so I was going to check it out today.</p>
<p>I’ll try the one with the least magic power first. I wonder how did I get this? Honestly, I can’t tell by the looks which one I got from where.</p>
<p>『Hoho! Nuuh......』</p>
<p>「Master, are you okay?」</p>
<p>『Yeah. It has much less resistance than removing the slave’s collar. Please wait...』</p>
<p>If I poured in magic power all at once, I had no idea what would happen. I was cautiously increasing my magic power slowly. Then the item bag shone light, and I could tell that the magic power had been transformed.</p>
<p>『Does it open with this?』</p>
<p>「How about I take you on?」</p>
<p>『Oh! It’s open!』</p>
<p>「What is in there?」</p>
<p>Fran had a thrilled look on her face too. It must feel like a treasure chest. However, her expression soon changed to a subtle one.</p>
<p>『That’s off.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Inside, all they had was an iron knife and a little bit of money. In addition, they also had some carrying food. It must have been treated as an emergency bag in case of an emergency.</p>
<p>What came out of the bag opened next was a large number of weapons. It was not of very high quality, but it could be used normally. Could it be a substitute for a bandit’s weaponry?</p>
<p>『I guess that’s off too.』</p>
<p>「......Nn.」</p>
<p>I opened it up like that, but nothing useful came out. The most valuable was an ordinary silver ring that had no magic value.</p>
<p>Even if I sold everything that came out, it would not be enough to reach 300 thousand gold. It was not cheap, but it was far from the treasure Fran wanted.</p>
<p>『This is our last attack』</p>
<p>「......Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran nodded at him! But I think we can expect this a little. After all, the magic power contained in it was quite strong.</p>
<p>『Haaa!』</p>
<p>I kneaded the magic power into a large amount and destroyed the restrictions on the item bags. There was quite a backlash, maybe as strong as the collars of the slaves of Princess Selymea and Sierra.</p>
<p>If it were a human body, I wouldn’t be surprised if it were in a state where blood was gushing out of its entire body. Well, I wouldn’t be a problem though!</p>
<p>『Whoa! It’s open!』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran opened the item bag and took out the contents, looking a little hopeful. She tilted her head at what was coming out.</p>
<p>There were plenty of documents in there.</p>
<p>「Here......! Slavers!」</p>
<p>『Moreover, this is our customer list!』</p>
<p>We could get a lot of information about where the slaves were brought in and where to sell them. I could feel a slight hint of curse-type magic coming from them, so it must have been some kind of magic coming from them.</p>
<p>The contract didn’t even give them any minimum rights. The contract was clearly for illegal slaves, but there was no sign of them being used.</p>
<p>They must have been prepared in advance to create an illegal slave.</p>
<p>『Our list... Many names look like nobles, but which country is it? Could it be Kranzel?』</p>
<p>「Master, here.」</p>
<p>『I see Ashtner’s name!』</p>
<p>And that’s not all. It also had the names of the nobles under Ashtner’s command, like Alsand and Ormez.</p>
<p>As I’d expected, the nobles in the Kranzel Kingdom were also probably among their customers. They were not only buying illegal slaves, but they could also be connected to the Raidos Kingdom behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Marquis Ashtner and his men may have already been exterminated, but there may be other traitors left behind. This list can be used to expose such spies.</p>
<p>『We can’t leave it in a strange place』</p>
<p>「What about Gamudo and his friends?」</p>
<p>『Well, I guess that’s the best』</p>
<p>Aside from Eiworth, the other three probably have their histories. We should talk to them first.</p>
