</div><h1>Chapter 1046</h1><p>It was the day after our departure from Gordicia.</p>
<p>Fran was immediately relaxed on the deck. She transformed Urushi into his just-suited size and laid him down as a long chair. Urushi was also getting better at sitting on it with Fran on board.</p>
<p>Fran took out the fruit juice in that state and sucked it off with a straw. It had a happy expression on it. By the way, the straws were made of a material that looked just like magic beasts. Thanks to the magic beast materials, there were surprisingly many items that were on par with Earth.</p>
<p>We’ve been asked to write a proper report on the continent of Gordisia, but... well, the boat trips will still continue, and we’ll have time to write a report tomorrow or later.</p>
<p>「Great breeze.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>Because of the large ship’s fast hull, the deck was constantly blowing with a wind of just the right strength. Urushi’s long fur was quickly stroked and his fur was dancing like a strong wind Pomeranian.</p>
<p>Fran felt really comfortable as she buried her entire body there. She was buried in a huge fluffy creature, sipping juices and falling apart.</p>
<p>The problem was that she sometimes sneezed, but if she closed her eyes to it, all the children’s dream would be fulfilled.</p>
<p>(Master)</p>
<p>『What is it?』</p>
<p>(I want to try some pancakes.)</p>
<p>『T-this is the warehouse?』</p>
<p>(Nn. Can I?)</p>
<p>Bring more child’s dream huh!?</p>
<p>We had a lot of fierce battles in Gordicia, and these sorts of requests were pretty damn cute. I took out the pancakes from storage and handed it to Fran.</p>
<p>It’s not like we were hit by Fran’s begging cuteness, okay?</p>
<p>(Fuoooh, with a bit of cream!)</p>
<p>『Fufufu. So, there’s a lot of fun hidden in the cream!』</p>
<p>(Have fun?)</p>
<p>It only contained cut fruits, but this kind of play was very appreciated. In fact, Fran seemed to be having a good time with the cream.</p>
<p>「Fruit!」</p>
<p>『Ooh, we found them.』</p>
<p>「Mogu mogu, it’s delicious」</p>
<p>Fran held up the fruit stabbed with her fork high and threw it straight into her mouth. The area around her mouth was covered with cream. And Urushi’s fur too.</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>『Fran, Urushi’s fur is covered with cream, which is amazing』</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>Aah―, every time Fran moved, the cream became even more useful... Moreover, it was scattered in the wind and had white spots on a considerable area.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t come off just by wiping it off normally. She definitely needed to wash it whole.</p>
<p>「...If I dump it on the sea, it’ll fall」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>『If it’s sea water, your hair will get crisp later! Let’s wash it with water magic. Hmm? Come on, if I make it smaller, I’ll wash it quickly!』</p>
<p>「Okay. Urushi, you’ll get smaller too」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>If Urushi had been smaller, the equipment would have a size adjuster, but the dirt was still there. A large amount of cream entangled in it and the dirt entangled in the back of his fur remained intact.</p>
<p>In other words, a super dirty little dog with white cream and black dirt all over its body exploded in front of us.</p>
<p>There were also small pebbles scattered around the area. I was unaware that it was on the ground, but the dirt that had fallen from Urushi was very conspicuous on the deck.</p>
<p>We had taken a good bath in one of the simplest baths on the continent of Gordicia, but they’re huge. You’ll get dirty quickly if you move a little.</p>
<p>Urushi then used his Bottomless Shadow to immediately erase the debris around him. I see, this was how he used it in this technique.</p>
<p>「Then I’ll wash you off, okay?」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Ahhhhh!」</p>
<p>As I was trying to keep Urushi clean, Fran’s movement suddenly stopped. She moved only her neck and stared towards the sea. But since the water was still gushing out, Urushi was going to do something amazing, right?</p>
<p>「Gar... Gar!」</p>
<p>「It’s coming magic beasts」</p>
<p>「Geheh Geh!」</p>
<p>「Stop the water! I know the great magic beast has arrived!」</p>
<p>Urushi was freed from the forced waterfall line and was shaking his body to send water flying. Fran had completely distanced herself from the ship and was looking down at the surface of the sea from here.</p>
<p>『He’s coming』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>What emerged from the surface was a huge sea Urushi about two meters in diameter. His name was Jumping Sea Urushi. He had skills such as Jumping, needle generation, and blood sucking.</p>
<p>If he jumped at it and got stabbed, he would just suck the blood and kill it.</p>
<p>I want that magic stone. It’s a staple of otherworld reincarnation survival skills, it allows me to drain the blood of my flesh!</p>
<p>The crew members started to move on deck, but by that time, Fran had already jumped out.</p>
<p>We were able to get a feel for the mana in the Jumping Searkin and find out where it was. We were in a total of about twenty of them, I guess?</p>
<p>『Fran, let’s use ice and snow magic instead of thunder magic』</p>
<p>(Why? Lightning is easier.)</p>
<p>After years of infiltrating the battlefield, she must have understood that thunder magic can penetrate water and cause damage to the surrounding area. Fran tilted her head.</p>
<p>But there was a serious reason why they couldn’t use it.</p>
<p>『If I give it a heat, my body might deteriorate』</p>
<p>(Can we eat that one?)</p>
<p>『Yeah. It’s sea Urushi and it looks delicious』</p>
<p>(! Got it, I’ll use my ice and snow magic to defeat it!)</p>
<p>We’re going to have a full meal tonight. I know someone I’m not very good at, but Fran――</p>
<p>「Uni... I’ve never even eaten one. It looks delicious」</p>
<p>Fran will be fine.</p>
