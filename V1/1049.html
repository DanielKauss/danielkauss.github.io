</div><h1>Chapter 1049</h1><p>I saw the multiple Kanna Kamui that we released begin to deflect the barrier that was deployed at the top of the water dragonkin.</p>
<p>The current Kanna Kamui was powerful enough to be called extreme magic. Just being able to block it was enough to make it powerful.</p>
<p>It was much stronger than the water dragonkin we fought before. The combination of the water dragon’s magic power and the magic power of the magic tool must have increased the strength of the barrier.</p>
<p>But as we grew up in Gordicia, we’ll get outta here!</p>
<p>『Daaaaaah!』</p>
<p>The moment I poured more magic power into it, the barrier exploded with a high-pitched sound.</p>
<p>The white lightning went straight into the water dragonkin, shattering its hull――.</p>
<p>『Huh?』</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>She didn’t.</p>
<p>For some reason, the water dragonkin was not damaged at all, and a medium-sized ship located in the rear was engulfed in explosions. Even if lightning had reached them through the sea, the way it exploded was strange.</p>
<p>In the first place, it was impossible for them to be unscathed at all except one of them.</p>
<p>『What happened?』</p>
<p>「Looks like that」</p>
<p>『Huh?』</p>
<p>「Nn. Shield Technique」</p>
<p>『I see!』</p>
<p>That’s right. It was just like the shield technique we had been through many times, where we transferred our damage to our friends.</p>
<p>But is that even possible between the ships? Or does he already have a magic tool that makes it possible?</p>
<p>Anyway, this made it difficult for us to target the water dragonkin with any precision.</p>
<p>「If you try again and again, all of them will disappear.」</p>
<p>『Yeah. The barrier has already been repaired, so we can’t keep going with the same attack until the fleet is gone. We don’t have any magic power after all』</p>
<p>「Then all we have to do is get on board and defeat them all」</p>
<p>『Hmmm. They’re scared of getting trapped inside the barrier. It’ll take a while, but I think it’d be a good idea to destroy everything but the water dragonkin, right?』</p>
<p>They would sink the other ships that were personnel in charge of transferring damage, and finally defeat the water dragonkin. They would also reduce the number of people needed to take over the town, and this may seem like a long way around, but this was the most solid way to fight.</p>
<p>「Then we’ll destroy the other ships!」</p>
<p>『Yeah!』</p>
<p>「Grrr!」</p>
<p>We split up and began our attack on the enemy fleet. By purposely exposing ourselves, we attracted the enemy’s attention and crushed each of the enemy ships one by one.</p>
<p>It worked at first. Urushi showed off his huge body and sometimes got small and attacked ships from the sea, and Fran flew around in the sky while thundering.</p>
<p>The enemy fleet was in chaos. It was a small ship, but we had succeeded in sinking a few of them.</p>
<p>However, something strange soon appeared.</p>
<p>To my surprise, they started to set up more wards than just the water dragonkin. Rather than constantly covering the entire area, they seemed to be set up so that they could react to our attack and set up thick wards only in that area.</p>
<p>Moreover, even if the attack was successful, a similar phenomenon would occur and the damage would be transferred to a smaller ship.</p>
<p>They must have been taking various measures to protect the major ships. They were clearly designed to be powerful enough to destroy the fleet on their own.</p>
<p>So, this means that they are prepared for this much defense?</p>
<p>「Hmm? People?」</p>
<p>『Suddenly!』</p>
<p>Suddenly, something jumped out of the deck of the water dragonkin. And without any killing intent or fighting spirit, she released an ice bullet at us.</p>
<p>If we hadn’t experienced a similar battle in Trismegistus, we might have gotten one.</p>
<p>「Girl......? That neck!」</p>
<p>『She’s being enslaved.』</p>
<p>The girl in front of us was a beautiful girl about the same age as Fran, with dark hair, blonde eyes, and reddish-copper skin. She was dressed in a black military hat and a military uniform.</p>
<p>Apparently, he wasn’t flying, but created ice sheets in the air and used them as a foothold to jump. He seemed to be using wind magic to help him jump.</p>
<p>He approached Fran while fluttering his black cloak, which looked like a trench coat. Was it the horns that grew out of his temples? I wondered if he was a demonkin, but I felt something was odd with his growth...</p>
<p>The horned girl shot magic at Fran, but for some reason, she didn’t seem to have any killing or fighting intent.</p>
<p>『Looks like he’s robbed of his will』</p>
<p>「Nn......!」</p>
<p>Fran looked at the girl’s neck with hatred. A dull metallic ring was attached to her neck.</p>
<p>It was the slave collar. Moreover, it seemed that they were somehow deprived of their will and turned into a puppet.</p>
<p>The girl unleashed ice and snow magic at us without any conversation between us.</p>

<p>Saber of Wind Mist, Water Dragon’s Scale Leather Armor, adaptation cloak, Water Dragon Leather Gloves, Water Dragon Shoes, Commander Hat, Heavy Snow Ring, Ice Bracelet.</p>
<p>He was quite strong, his stats were not consistent with his level. Obviously, he was not strong enough to match his level. His magic power relations were remarkable, but his strength was quite high.</p>
<p>They were puppets in a state where they were deprived of their free will.</p>
<p>Besides, I’m also curious about their name. Seedrun? So, they’re related to the Sea Kingdom of Seedrun? Under normal circumstances, they would be like princesses. Their skill set must be a water dragon’s bond.</p>
<p>The fact that they were being controlled probably meant that the Raidos Kingdom was doing something to them. Since they had been targeting the Royal Family of Philias, there was no way that the country would respect the Royal Family of another country.</p>
<p>However, the one that attracted the most attention was her race.</p>
<p>『Magic beast... If you were a magic beast, you’d have to do some research on Zelyse』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Their research must have been about implanting magic stones in people to create a superhuman being.</p>
<p>But what about magical demons? Did they implant magic stones in a girl who was originally a demonkin?</p>
<p>『Yeah, and that toughness... I don’t think it was just because of him』</p>
<p>Could it be that she synthesized a magic stone and a demon horn on a human body? I wonder is that the secret of Marl’s strength?</p>
<p>Moreover, by making him a puppet, it seemed to have made it possible for him to control the demonkin who had lost their mind and went out of control.</p>
<p>「――Ice Bullet.」</p>
<p>「!! Hey!」</p>
<p>『It’s no use. Fran. She’s being enslaved and a demonkin.』</p>
<p>「But......!」</p>
<p>Fran ducked the ice and snow magic that was unleashed, but it didn’t come out in a counterattack. She hesitated to attack the girl.</p>
<p>「It’s a freeze shot」</p>
<p>『Fran! Attack!』</p>
<p>「No! But!」</p>
<p>Just by looking at the silver collar that appealed to my vision, I felt as if I was comparing it to my former self.</p>
<p>It was not that she was just controlling it, but the fact that she was wearing a slave collar was probably important. Moreover, she was a girl of her age.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s more difficult not to compare them, but...</p>
<p>If things continued like this, they would just get attacked one-sidedly.</p>
