</div><h1>Chapter 1130</h1><p>「I can see it! It’s all around me!」</p>
<p>『Just as one of Avenger’s men said』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Based on the information we obtained, we headed for a fort in the Raidos Kingdom, but the end of the battle had already opened.</p>
<p>Moreover, with three sides surrounded by enemies, the Kranzel army is in a very dangerous situation.</p>
<p>Just like the in the report, the red knights were there too. Forrund was facing him, but was he an opponent that even that man could not defeat?</p>
<p>How can we save the Kranzel army? It’s not something we can just rush in without thinking.</p>
<p>As I was wondering about what to do while running to the battlefield, something strange happened.</p>
<p>The white light enveloped the adventurers. Some of the knights were also glowing. I could feel the healing mana, so it didn’t seem like an attack from the enemy. The center of their mana was around the adventurers.</p>
<p>An enormous amount of magic power gushed out from a demonkin, even a hint of kindness. It was thick, long horns, and a huge body on the level of Ashwrath. Even though it was seen from a distance with viewing skills, it was intimidating and powerful.</p>
<p>No one in Alessa was that conspicuous of a demonkin, right? Was she a valiant warrior from another guild?</p>
<p>No, wait a minute. That face... Could it be you’re Donad? Donadrond?</p>
<p>He’s changed too much in such a short time! His body has swelled up, his horns have grown, and the quality of the magic power he releases has been considerably altered.</p>
<p>But now that the entire battlefield was perplexed, this was our chance.</p>
<p>『Fran, let’s go rescue Forrund first.』</p>
<p>(Got it.)</p>
<p>The young magician facing Forrund was probably the Crimson Flame Knight from the intel. I heard that he was strong, but if we and Forrund fought at the same time, he would not be an opponent we could beat.</p>
<p>Hearing her abilities, I guess she was just like Isario’s subordinates.</p>
<p>And we had more forces than just the antidemon brigade. If we could send them to destroy the enemy undead, we could save the adventurers too.</p>
<p>In other words, we should be able to make it in time.</p>
<p>「Hey, he’s not going to die」</p>
<p>「Huh! What is it, my priestess!?」</p>
<p>What responded to Fran’s words with great force was the undead running behind her. A vicious ghoul that emitted evil energy. Yes, this was the Genoside Ghoul commander who had attacked me. The Genoside Ghouls under his command were also following closely.</p>
<p>The ghouls, who called themselves Avengers of the Black Skeleton Army, began to follow Fran for a certain reason.</p>
<p>A few hours ago.</p>
<p>My Evil Spirit Conquest skill had succeeded in abusing the Genoside Ghoul.</p>
<p>Don’t move, obey. Stop the fight. With that in mind, I manipulated the evil inside the ghouls, and it certainly slowed down their movements.</p>
<p>『This is the perfect opportunity for us to kill your Evil Spirits! Slayer, slayer, and slayer!』</p>
<p>「Nn! Haaa!」</p>
<p>「Shiiiit!」</p>
<p>In order to defeat the ghoul, Fran slashed at it with the Evil Crusher at full force. However, the blade did not slash at the ghoul.</p>
<p>「O priestess! My priestess! Did I wrong! Permit me!」</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>『Huh?』</p>
<p>The ghouls suddenly dissipated hostility and got down on their knees. The killing intent that had been pointed at them up until now was also lurking around.</p>
<p>「......Are you sure?」</p>
<p>「Haa! I have a revelation from the Goddess in my divine vessel that I will obey you!」</p>
<p>The other ghouls also gathered around Fran and knelt, matching her commander. All of them except a few that had already been defeated.</p>
<p>「Nn. But I can’t borrow the power of the Evil God’s piece」</p>
<p>As I was thinking about this, the piece of the Evil God inside me wriggled. It wasn’t that it had unleashed tremendous power. However, a dense piece of Evil Spirit overflowed slightly, blessing the ghouls.</p>
<p>「Oooh! Ooooh! O my God! I understand!」</p>
<p>「「「「Yeah!」」」」</p>
<p>The ghouls let loose a roar of joy. If the tear glands had been alive, they would have definitely broken through.</p>
<p>The ghouls, rubbing their knees and foreheads against the ground, lamented Fran.</p>
<p>「O priestess! Our priestess! You truly are a priestess!」</p>
<p>「Must have been the priestess!」</p>
<p>「Guide us!」</p>
<p>Was it my imagination that the pieces of the Evil Gods were giving off a rather proud atmosphere? Anyway, the Evil Conquest I used and the pieces of the Evil Gods I used were both sure to impress and knock the ghouls out.</p>
<p>The sudden craziness of the ghouls, or rather, their surrender, bewildered both the valiant soldiers and Mareficent. Even this Persona could feel their bewilderment.</p>
<p>Well, you’re right. Fran was suddenly starting to be revered. Moreover, it seemed that Mareficent sensed the evil spirits because the Evil God Fragment had taken its own actions.</p>
<p>「Black Lightning Princess-dono? What the hell is this......?」</p>
<p>「...Somehow, this has happened」</p>
<p>「Seliadot! Are you even listening to me!?」</p>
<p>「It’s okay. They had the power to manipulate evil energy, so they were no longer enemies.」</p>
<p>「Well, Black Lightning Princess-dono is fine. So, for now, I guess we have no choice but to accept it」</p>
<p>She must have remembered the unwritten rule of not forcing adventurers to listen to each other. She didn’t ask any further.</p>
<p>The warriors looked at Fran with an adored look as if she had easily controlled the highest level undead.</p>
<p>「Y-Yeah! Captain! Curry!」</p>
<p>「Morning priestess! You’re a cat ear priestess!」</p>
<p>「Even the Cat Ear priestess! That’s impressive! Captain of the Cat Ear priestess! Curry!」</p>
<p>「Must have been the priestess! With those black cat ears, hear the word of the Gods!」</p>
<p>Somehow, all of them except for Mareficent and Persona were in a weird situation where they all worshiped Fran.</p>
<p>『Let’s talk to the ghouls for now』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Hopefully we can get some info on the Kingdom of Raidos though.</p>
