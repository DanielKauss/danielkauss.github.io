</div><h1>Chapter 970</h1><p>Race: Ragnarok Wolf; Demon Wolf; Magic Beast</p>
<p>「We’ll go all around while Black Lightning Princess-dono’s attention is on us! Everyone, rush!」</p>
<p>「「「「Yes!」」」」</p>
<p>「「「Yeah!」」」</p>
<p>The old soldiers under his command as well as the soldiers and adventurers from other countries obeyed his voice, as the commander of the Kingdom of Hagane.</p>
<p>I guess it was partly because he was an officer of a large country. But not only that, he had a presence that forced him to obey. It might be an effect of his command-type skills.</p>
<p>Anyway, we should be fine as long as we left the commander of the unit to her.</p>
<p>『Urushi, keep the position so high that the giant-type is impatient that it can move around and try to react directly to it』</p>
<p>「W-Woof?」</p>
<p>『Don’t get too close to him.』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>『Fran, let’s use magic to randomly provoke her』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>She fired flashy and explosive spells that looked just spectacular on the face. There was almost no damage.</p>
<p>It originally had high defense, but the magic absorption effect greatly weakened the power of the magic. And when it hits it, it was weakened into power that could be easily blocked by the magic barrier.</p>
<p>That’s fine since it’s only meant to be a provocation, but we’ll have to be more careful when attacking properly.</p>
<p>「Ruoooooogh!」</p>
<p>「Muh!」</p>
<p>『Tsk! You’re just a wooden doll!?』</p>
<p>The giant-type we had been watching closely for a while to store the rubble had suddenly changed the way we attacked it.</p>
<p>They were not large rubble, but rather small boulders that had been held in their hands and thrown like a barrage. Each of them was more than a metre long, even small.</p>
<p>A direct hit from it would be dangerous even for the current Fran.</p>
<p>It would be easy to avoid them if we just ignored the scattered bullets of these rocks, which might cause damage to the second unit. The giant-type antidemons threw rocks at angles that were aimed for that too.</p>
<p>It’s a pretty smart sign. It’s big, intelligent, defensive, and regenerative. It’s more of a type of enemy that can’t be controlled by its base capabilities than its special abilities. It might resemble the Midgardsorm among its enemies in the past. Well, that was pretty stupid over there though.</p>
<p>Moreover, I didn’t even know what kind of hidden ball it was yet.</p>
<p>『I’ll knock the rocks down with telekinesis and wind magic. Fran, you can stow away the nearby!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>After about five clashes, the giant-type antidemons threw rubble at us. The spells and arrows coming from the soldiers got rather violent.</p>
<p>It seemed like they really didn’t want their faces to be targeted without any damage. The number of times they wielded long-range attacks with their hands increased.</p>
<p>And it seemed that the giant-type dragonkin had finally made his move.</p>
<p>「Ruuurgh!」</p>
<p>Urushi, can you keep this distance?』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Its huge body was moving toward us and the soldiers behind it. It was steadily approaching us one step at a time, destroying the rubble and houses it had been destroyed.</p>
<p>It may look slow, but if it was the size of a 200-meter class guy, a step would be over 50 meters.</p>
<p>He had already reached the city wall in no time. With a dull sound, his huge body collided with the city wall. His legs didn’t seem to rise high enough to be caught by the city wall.</p>
<p>「Ruaaaaah!」</p>
<p>「No, this way!」</p>
<p>「Ruaaaa!」</p>
<p>「Woof―」</p>
<p>Fran and Urushi leapt around in front of the giant-type faces, looking particularly relaxed. Then, the giant-type roared in anger and rushed forward at an even faster pace than before, destroying the city walls.</p>
<p>He reached out his hand and tried to grab her, but Urushi was skillfully maintaining a distance that could not be reached just in time.</p>
<p>That’s when the giant-type got even stronger.</p>
<p>She was desperately trying to capture Fran with the tremendous sound of her footsteps.</p>
<p>Her consciousness was completely upwards.</p>
<p>Fran emitted obviously powerful magic power, while the second army was not so strong per person, even though there were many of them. Antidemons seemed to want to eat Fran’s as bait first.</p>
<p>They followed me as far as I could see.</p>
<p>I thought she was intelligent, but that may not be as intelligent as I thought she would be. She was obviously unaware that something was coming out of her mouth. Or maybe she was just taller than I thought she would be defeated by a small opponent like us?</p>
<p>Anyway, your actions were the reason for your defeat.</p>
<p>『Great Wall!』</p>
<p>The giant-type collapsed as it pulled its legs against a wall created by Earth Magic, while holding onto the air with its hand.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>For a moment, an impact that was enough to make the soldiers’ bodies shiver shook the earth. It was just a normal moss, but it seemed that the weight of the stones caused a lot of damage from self-destruct.</p>
<p>But I was not the only one who created the wall. And the commander, you, was the one who fired the land magic at it.</p>
<p>She was apparently a wielder of land magic.</p>
<p>The width and other parts of the figure were adjusted nicely to make it look perfect for knocking over a giant. The level of control over it was probably pretty great.</p>
<p>As long as they were the superiors of the Divine Swordsman, they were also great wielders.</p>
<p>『Alright! I’m going to attack you now!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
