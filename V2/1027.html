</div><h1>Chapter 1027</h1><p>Sophie fell down coughing up a lot of blood from her mouth and eyes. Her body remained lightly twitched, unable to get up. </p>
<p>「Sophie!」</p>
<p> Fran exclaimed, but Fran herself, who was controlling a large amount of magic power, could not move. </p>
<p>『I’ll help you. Fran, focus!』</p>
<p>(Master, please.)</p>
<p> I transformed my decorative cord into the shape of a hand and gently picked up Sophie’s body. The sound of her heart was quiet, and her body was surprisingly cold. I tried to use healing magic to heal her, but it was unsuccessful. I tried to use healing magic, but it was unsuccessful.  I tried to use my Great Magic Skill to use Greater Heal, but Sophie’s heartbeat was just getting weaker.  I really wanted to talk to her to encourage her, but she couldn’t talk to her. But I haven’t found out who I was.  No, now’s not the time to be talking.  She was in a state of death with damage from the divine attribute.  I should have done anything to her as long as I could be of assistance.  Fran would be saddened if Sophie died, and I wouldn’t hate her either. She wouldn’t die in a place like this.  </p>
<p>『Sophie, hang in there!  I’ll heal you now!』</p>
<p>(... Fran’s sword......?)</p>
<p>『K-You noticed it?』</p>
<p>(I connected it to my song......I’ll find it......)</p>
<p> As expected of a musician!  It seems that songs connecting everyone together, like the adventurer’s song, conveyed Fran’s identity to her.  But this girl should be fine. She wouldn’t be able to talk down, and I’m sure Fran would find out sooner or later if I left her alone. </p>
<p>『Sorry, but I’ve stopped Fran from revealing my identity to them』</p>
<p>(She knows......)</p>
<p> She didn’t seem to be angry. Besides, Sophie’s condition was getting better and better little by little.  Greater Heal, with its divine attribute, seemed to have worked. I also thought it might have had some effect on revealing her identity as well. As I was healing Sophie, the battlefield moved even further.  </p>
<p>「Ahahahaha!  Well, I’m going to do it now!」</p>
<p> Jayne, the Queen of the Demons, held up a huge book with a grin.  </p>
<p>「Come out!  The strongest and oldest king ever!」</p>
<p>  It was a golden coffin that appeared from this huge magical circle. The golden coffin engraved with countless skulls exuded a chilling divine aura even before it opened.  </p>
<p>「Our ancestors and our first contractors!  Inhale your life to reveal it! Necro Dovey!」</p>
<p>「Nuhahaha! It’s been a long time since I’ve been in this world!」</p>
<p>  What appeared from the gold coffin was a mummy with a similar appearance to the spirits we had just seen. Its equipment may be a little luxurious, but there was no significant difference in its appearance.  On a robe made of silver threads, she was wearing a whole body armor covered in gold, and each finger was clad in a ring that appeared to be a magic tool.  All of them had a vulgar radiance.  However, the supremacy that Mummy exuded was a moderate ornament that showed her dignity. The presence that the main body exuded was tremendous.  </p>
<p>「I know this is bad, but I don’t have time.  I’ll cut the big monster in pieces and send it to hell!」</p>
<p>「Hohou?  Are you sure!? I’ll give you my death!」</p>
<p>  The necro dovey floating in the sky waved his hand, and a large sickle appeared.  It was a jet-black sickle covered in terrifying magic that fit the name Death Size.  The necro with a ferocious smile flew toward the giant antidemon. It was probably because of his physical properties as a spirit, or rather, he was gliding around.  However, despite his strength, it seemed that there was a high price to pay for using it. Magic power flowed from Jayne to the necro at a tremendous pace, as if her life had been sucked out.  At this rate, she wouldn’t be able to stay summoned for a few minutes.  </p>
<p>「Nuhahahaha!」</p>
<p>  I saw the power coming from Jayne flow from the necro to the scythe. In an instant, the size of her death exploded.  It was probably 20 meters long.  The necromancer lightly raised such an extraordinary scythe and gave it a powerful thrust in the middle of the giant antidemon.  It seems that the giant antidemons, whose power had been weakened by Sophie’s song of destruction, had greatly reduced their defenses as well. The size of the giant death thrusts deep into the root.  </p>
<p>「Life, shatter it!」</p>
<p>  With the cries of the necromancer, the death size of the giant antidemons shone black, disappearing as if sucked into the giant antidemons. </p>
<p>「Giiiiiiiiiiii!」</p>
<p> Just as I thought I heard the screams of the giant antidemons, magic power drained from my entire body, cracked and shattered from the surface.  It seemed that the death size had the effect of diminishing our opponent’s vitality and killing them.  The fact that even that giant antidemons could not stop deteriorating suggested that those magic beasts and humans might die just by grazing them. It was a strength befitting a trump card. However, we have not yet defeated it.  </p>
<p>「Ahahaha...  I didn’t know that I couldn’t defeat it yet. to be enough to defeat them.  Disappointing.」</p>
<p>  Jayne lost her stance and fell to one knee with a dry smile.  The necronomicon twisted, lost its form as a letter, and returned to the dagger. I guess it meant the limit.  </p>
<p>「Umm, I can’t do that anymore.  I’ll leave the rest to you......」</p>
<p>  Jayne said so and fell to the ground.  The other side seemed pretty bad too! However, I saw a healing power flooding out of the pendant on her chest.  Apparently, she had prepared for the backlash of the divine sword. Besides, she no longer had time to go help Fran.  She was ready to take Fran one step further with Urushi.  What we were looking at was a giant antidemon.  </p>
<p>《Magical conductivity complete. Maintained.》</p>
<p>「Let’s go!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p> Wolf-Style Sword Drawing Technique, the combined technique of Fran and Urushi, was a technique that used Urushi’s mana to blow Fran down from the sky.  But this time, Fran casually grabbed the smaller form of Urushi.  </p>
<p>『Eh?  Fran? Urushi?』</p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  Fran ran out and threw Urushi away with great force.  The current Fran had thrown him with all her might. Urushi flew away with a force that was far beyond that of a large lager.  </p>
<p>『Eh?  Wai!』</p>
<p>「Give me a go!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  Urushi, who had become a Flying Wolf, grew larger in his state.  Urushi was spinning around and clothed in darkness all over his body. He seemed to be planning to unleash a huge blow by adding the power of speed, spinning, dark magic, and Dimensional Fangs to it.  The magic bullets did not fly away.  It was probably because he was chasing Isario right now.  </p>
<p>「Ghuh!」</p>
<p>「Gigyiiiii!」</p>
<p>  Urushi rotated and slammed his large fangs against the giant antidemons. The screams of the antidemons must have told us the power of the spell.  By concentrating all of his power on a single point, a deep crack was drilled into the giant antidemon.  </p>
<p>『Yosh!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  I’d like to praise him and pet him, but it was our turn now. Or rather, Fran, who had chased after us with the Black Lightning Roll, had already unleashed a slash.  </p>
<p>『Uwooorgh! I’ll devour all your power!』</p>
<p>《Leave the control support to me.》</p>
<p>『Please Announcer-san!  Just do it!  Fran!』</p>
<p>「Nn!  The Black Lightning God’s Claw!</p>
<p>「Nn! Black Lightning God’s Claw! Heaven Judgement!」</p>
