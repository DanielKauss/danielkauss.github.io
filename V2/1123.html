</div><h1>Chapter 1123</h1><p>The map that Mareficent came out of showed several roads. He pointed to two of them and explained them to us. </p>
<p>「The route is longer, but it’s flat and it’s unlikely that you’ll run into enemy scouts. On the other hand, this one is quite short, but there’s some areas where I’m a little worried」</p>
<p>「Are you worried?」</p>
<p>「This road is a route through the mountains, but some of it is still within Raydoss’s sphere of influence」</p>
<p> The Kranzel Kingdom’s forces have extended their sphere of influence within the Raydoss Kingdom, but they have only slightly cut off the area near the borderline. It seems to be mottled due to the mixture of their dominant territory and the areas that they have not yet reached. It seems that the area under their control and the area that they have not yet reached are complicated and mottled.  And that was not the only concern. </p>
<p>「There used to be a stronghold along this road where Evil God admirers gathered」</p>
<p> It was in the country of Raidos, but it was destroyed by someone」</p>
<p> After that, I remembered when I heard Mareficent’s explanation. It must have been the place where they had their headquarters, destroyed by Zelos Reed.  </p>
<p>「I’ve heard of it before」</p>
<p>「O-ooh, I see. I see.  Well, it was a famous story on this continent after all」</p>
<p>  It was indeed a very dangerous place for a den of Evil God admirers. If there were people as powerful as Linford and Zelos Reed, the warriors might be affected. Well, it would be fine if the Evil God’s followers were still gathered here. </p>
<p>「So, they’re actually not corrupt?」</p>
<p>「No, no.  It seems that the Evil God’s admirers have disappeared and appear to have no people」</p>
<p>「...But why do you think it’s dangerous?」</p>
<p>「Well, millennial fort and evil god admirers. </p>
<p>「How did the Evil God’s admirers get that fort?」</p>
<p>「Of course, that’s strange too」</p>
<p> Now that you mention it, it was certainly strange.  It seems to be a rather large fort, but would the Raidos Kingdom be left stolen by the Evil God admirers? Normally, would the red knights move?  Or was it a fort that was built on their own by the evil god admirers?  No, even so, it wouldn’t be a reason for the red knights to leave them unattended. The rumors all over the continent made it strange for them to keep being used as an Evil Person’s base for a long time. However, that was not the only strange thing that Mareficent was talking about.  </p>
<p>「Well, a lot of things have come to light about the Kingdom of Raidos before and after this war. Why was only the information about Mirenia’s fort spreading among the Raidos Kingdom, which was concerned about such security?」</p>
<p>「Ooh, certainly」</p>
<p>  Yes!  Certainly!  It would be strange if the name of the Mirenia fort was mentioned by a normal adventurer! At that time, I only heard that Zelos Reed had destroyed it and wondered if there was such a place...  But it was strange that stories came to the Kingdom of Kranzel that the fort where the Evil God’s admirers were gathered had been destroyed. The other information was completely blocked, but why was that story only spreading?  It was as if only that information had been intentionally scattered.  There was a possibility that the Evil God’s followers who had escaped had spread the rumors... Could it be that the Eastern Duke was connected to the Evil God Adventurers?  And for some reason, did they spread the word about the Evil God Adventurers? Mareficent seemed to be guessing so too, and they were wondering if they should use the nearby route.  </p>
<p>(Master, what do we do?)</p>
<p>『If only we’d been scouting it out for now, we’re in the middle of a quest.  Let’s take some safety measures』</p>
<p>「Nn.  Okay, I’ll use the safe route this time」</p>
<p>「Okay, let’s use that one. Will we train like today again tomorrow?」</p>
<p>「Of course」</p>
<p>「Well, if we’re going to run all day long, we’ll be able to make up for the delay on the first day」</p>
<p>  It seemed that they decided to continue the boot camp all day tomorrow. After explaining the situation to them, Mareficent and the others left.  They said they love heroes, and they were prepared to be asked more about digging up leaves, but...  However, it was not that they were not interested in us. They seemed to be hesitant because they were doing their work. Even though they were Rank A, they were common sense everywhere.  The next day.  They were running the same brave warriors who had been fed meat and bread starting the morning. No one was anymore disobeying Fran.  It seems that their fear had been imprinted so firmly that even a day would pass without them.  Well, how could this tragedy be forgotten for only one night? Fran’s voice echoed in the morning.  </p>
<p>「Those below the goblins.  Run faster and more happily!」</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>「Answer!」</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Yes! Commander!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>  Yes, that’s right.  Fran’s Bootcamp was going well. I rarely give them any advice, but she was really a sergeant, wasn’t she?  As I was impressed, Fran threw more words at the valiant soldiers.  </p>
<p>「I’ll teach you magic words」</p>
<p> Magical words? </p>
<p>「After you answer, I’ll add curry!」</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>『?』</p>
<p>「Answer me?」</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Yes, captain! Curry!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>「Nn.  That’s okay」</p>
<p> That’s not good!  Do you mean like be careful!?  No, I really am not teaching you anything! Does that mean the Sergeant’s talent that resides within Fran has begun to show itself?  </p>
<p>「I’ll feed you curry again today. If you imagine that and shout curry, you’ll be fine!」</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Yes, captain!</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Yeah, captain!</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Yeah, captain! Curry!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
