</div><h1>Chapter 968</h1><p>The strength of each unit should be evenly matched as much as possible. Normally, they would want to have three divine swords separated from each other.</p>
<p>But then there was one problem.</p>
<p>They were treated as Berserk. Because of the risk of them going out of control, a large army could result in them taking each other down.</p>
<p>However, the council was uneasy about releasing him on the current continent without any restrictions against Berserk.</p>
<p>That’s why we decided to accompany Isario as the leader of the Kingdom of Hagane. I guess the most dependable piece of the country was the one that made us the most anxious people in the world.</p>
<p>The main forces of each unit were the elites of the Holy Nation of Silard and the dragonkin, the first forces of the Militant Nation of Hagane and Isario, and the third forces of Jayne, Orfalve, and Hilt.</p>
<p>Sophie and Mea were not here by the way, since the restoration of Sendia’s wall was not complete yet and the town’s defense was their top priority. The council couldn’t deny the possibility of abandoning their stronghold and saving other towns, so they accepted her reasoning.</p>
<p>Fran belonged to the second unit. This unit had two divine swords, so there were few members. Instead, they had faces that allowed them to move fast and high-speed.</p>
<p>They were assembled with a focus on mobility so that they could reach the giant-types farther away as soon as possible.</p>
<p>They also had the Kingdom of Hagane, which they had marched with before, and the adventurers they knew, as well as a knight order accompanied by knights capable of riding on them.</p>
<p>With Isario leading the unit, Fran and the others were heading south on the continent. Our destination was one of the illegal cities located in the south-east of Sendia.</p>
<p>He said that we can’t get in touch with him now.</p>
<p>The adventurers, with Fran in the lead as the commander, were running at a speed no faster than the knights. This was thanks to the increase in the speed and physical strength of the adventurers they led due to the effect of Fran’s title, “March of the Valkyrie”.</p>
<p>It was not only the knights that lined up, but also the adventurers there seemed to be surprised. The old soldiers of Isario and General Hagane, who had already seen them once, were making a fuss again.</p>
<p>Isario must feel strange before he gets used to seeing it. He slipped on the board and approached us, and then he checked with Fran in a low voice.</p>
<p>「Young miss, this is your skill or magic, right?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「I see...... How long will this last? You last activated it for quite a long time, remember? If you’re trying to push yourself too hard, you can take a break along the way」</p>
<p>「Don’t worry」</p>
<p>March of the Valkyrie was a title, so there was no direct burden on Fran. She would only share some of her skills with her subordinates, so she would only have to activate her own. There was no particular increase in fatigue.</p>
<p>Well, the effect is halved when it’s shared, so I’m activating the skill stronger than usual, but that’s about it.</p>
<p>Isario thought with a serious face when he heard that. He had a very difficult look on his face.</p>
<p>「Young miss, I don’t want to talk about this title publicly」</p>
<p>Then, in a voice that only Fran could hear, she spoke a few words of advice.</p>
<p>「It’s just too easy to use military. You shouldn’t make it known around Silard, right?」</p>
<p>It’s getting even worse known to the Holy Nation again. Even Isario must have thought that it was a skill or magic that required some kind of price.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, that’s a natural ability. It was a title gained through skill-sharing with me, but it should be difficult for a normal person to get it. Or rather, it might be impossible for them to get it.</p>
<p>I didn’t even know if a normal person would remember the “Valkyrie” skill, since the “Valkyrie” skill seemed to be a prerequisite.</p>
<p>Thanks to that, there was little chance that they would know what kind of skill that was. It was a title that people wouldn’t normally think they possessed, and that shouldn’t even know about it.</p>
<p>My main concern was the appraisal, but I’d be fine as long as I had the disguised bracelet given to me by the Silver Lady.</p>
<p>However, as Isario seemed to have suspected, some of them would have noticed the strangeness if they had experienced it many times. Even the people of General Hagane might feel something strange too.</p>
<p>『Hmmm, what should we do?』</p>
<p>The best outcome would be to take a break and pretend to be tired, then refrain from using it for a while. I’d better imagine that it would be impossible to use it for a long time.</p>
<p>But Fran hated that.</p>
<p>(I’ll be that late if we take a break.)</p>
<p>『Well, you’re right...』</p>
<p>(We need to hurry up a bit.)</p>
<p>Now that the giants were rampaging around, Isario didn’t want to delay the march for his own convenience. While I was discussing with Fran what to do, Isario moved first.</p>
<p>They then approached the commander of the Kingdom of Hagane to discuss their future actions.</p>
<p>「Sakaki-dono, we’ll take a short break on the hill ahead. We’ll have to take a break for a while. The adventurers will just run away too」</p>
<p>「Yeah, I understand. But as I saw in the last match, the speed of this march is also amazing」</p>
<p>「Hahaha! You see, right? It’s a valuable magical tool, you know?」</p>
<p>「Hou? Was it Isario-dono’s possession?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. I got it from someone I knew.」</p>
<p>To my surprise, she said it was the effect of her magic tool. Fran, who was surprised, looked at Isario as if he was aware of her.</p>
<p>「Isario, for now.」</p>
<p>「Well well, just leave this to my uncle. I won’t be able to do anything about it, and he’ll even say that it was destroyed in the battle if it came to it」</p>
<p>「...Why did you go that far?」</p>
<p>「Uncle is a creature that wants to show his prowess to young people. Besides, the young lady is still going upstairs. So, it’s not a bad idea to give her a favor while you’re still young, right?」</p>
<p>「Thanks」</p>
<p>「Because I owe you one. Worst case scenario, I won’t let you die until you give it back.」</p>
<p>「Nn. I’ll definitely give it back」</p>
<p>「Please do」</p>
<p>Isario, this is no good even if he’s a bad dad. I’d be wary if he’d rent me out, but Isario wouldn’t feel uneasy at all.</p>
<p>Not only Fran but also I seemed to be starting to like him.</p>
