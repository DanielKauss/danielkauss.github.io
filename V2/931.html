</div><h1>Chapter 931</h1><p>「Alright. Whoa.」</p>
<p>『Fran, don’t be too upset, okay? You’re not in top form yet, okay?』</p>
<p>「Don’t worry.」</p>
<p> Fran was swinging me in the tower’s backyard. </p>
<p>『How about muscle pain?』</p>
<p>「No problem. But I’m fine.」</p>
<p> The backlash was terribly light compared to Mea and Velmeria’s. Mea and Zefmate’s stats were reduced, and they couldn’t use awakening. In addition, they seemed to be paying for their tremendous muscle pain. On the first day they woke up, they even couldn’t get up from the bed. Aside from Mea, I guess it’s because Zefmate screamed </p>
<p>「Ugyaaah!」</p>
<p>. Aside from Mea, I guess it was because Zefmate screamed </p>
<p>「Ugyaa!」</p>
<p>. to them.  On the other hand, Fran had already gotten up and was able to shake her off.  She was already asleep, but her status hadn’t changed, and she could use awakening.  The muscle pain was minimal, and there was no problem moving. Her stomach was already back to normal and she was feeling the same appetite as before.  Considering that it was the recoil from forcing herself to become a Divine Beast with the help of the Oratorio, it would be very light. Well, looking at it calmly, staying in a coma for ten days was not a light idea.  If I was alone, I might be defenseless for the rest of the day, and I might even die from starvation. So, she must have slept so deeply that she didn’t react even if I smelled the curry. Fenrir and the others must be grateful, considering that they had to pay the same price as Mea and the others.  Well, it’s not that they won’t actually pay a steep price for not being aware of it. It’s better to be careful for a while.  Fran is currently swinging her sword while withstood the muscular pain in her body. It seemed that she was trying to make her learn a little more about the feeling of the Divine Beast’s transformation.  Slowly, but steadily, she was seriously cutting down invisible enemies.  The Divine Beast’s transformation skill had already disappeared. It seemed that she wouldn’t be able to wield that much power without Oratrio’s help. Fran muttered in a wry voice.  </p>
<p>「... There was awakening in me」</p>
<p>『You’re right』</p>
<p>「If I train, can I use it again?」</p>
<p>『Hmm, I wonder』</p>
<p>  Divine Beast Transformation was a legendary skill that even Black Heavenly Tigers could hazy.  It was already close to the level of fairy tales. Will she be able to obtain such an illusionary skill just by training?  Not only would she become stronger, but she might need some kind of special key. That’s not going to be easy.  But Fran will not give up. With that power, Fran may be able to break the curse of the entire Black Cat kin on her own.  Once she found that hope, Fran couldn’t stop walking.  </p>
<p>「Shii.  Haaa!」</p>
<p>  Fran was slowly shaking me as she tried to instill the feeling of that time into her body. However, she quickly looked down on me and tilted her head.  </p>
<p>「Master, are you okay?」</p>
<p> She seemed to be concerned about my condition.  </p>
<p>『I’ll be fine too.  Because Fenrir and Announcer-san saved me』</p>
<p>「I see」</p>
<p>『Yeah』</p>
<p>  My price was only the cost of slowing down the auto-repair. It has also improved considerably over the past ten days.  Thanks to this, I was able to keep an eye on Fran as she sleeps. But instead, Fenrir and Announcer-san fell asleep. </p>
<p>「I’ll thank you if Announcer-san ever happens」</p>
<p>『Yeah, I’m sure they’ll be happy』</p>
<p>  Both Announcer-san and Fenrir were concerned about Fran. They would be happy if Fran showed them a cheerful appearance.  On the contrary, they also had new powers. As for the King Wolf and Wisdom, I was only borrowing the help of Fenrir and Announcer-san, so they could no longer use it after they fell asleep. However, the Mixed Slayer remained in its golden form, and they had newly acquired skills such as Evil Spirit Torment and Teleportation.  The Golden Devourer skill was created by the residue of Overgrowth, which was revitalized by Oratrio.  However, the Golden Devourer skill was reorganized for us by Announcer-san. The Golden Devourer skill, which can inflict significant damage on antidemons, will be very useful in the future battles on this continent.  Teleportation is a skill that allows you to more clearly communicate your intentions to the surface when you use Shapeshifts.Telepathy was a skill that allowed one to more clearly convey one’s intentions to the end when using Shapeshifts.  It must be a skill version of the power of Fanatics.  I think Announcer-san had saved that skill before she went to sleep.  And I wasn’t the only one who had gained anything.  Both Fran and Urushi’s stats had increased as their levels had gone up.  Currently, both of them were at level 70.  I’m sure they are ranked high in the world. If it was an RPG, they would be able to challenge themselves to the last dungeon with ease. </p>
<p>『In Fran’s case, her stats have increased a lot』</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>  To my surprise, her magic and agility had increased by more than 300.  Her other abilities have also increased by more than 100 across the board. Along with this, HP and MP had also increased, finally breaking over a thousand. Apparently, it was a sudden growth due to a combination of various factors.  First of all, the level.  It seemed that the growth of her stats would improve at once when it came to level 70 and above. But at the same time, it would be difficult for her level to rise tremendously.  The other effect of the Divine Beast Transformation. Although her skills had disappeared, her experience as a transcendental her body and senses must have been improved.  Moreover, the handling of thunder magic was clearly improved due to the fact that she did not appear in her stats. This was also a positive effect from the fact that she could manipulate the black lightning as she pleased.  I hadn’t tried it yet, but I’m sure she was able to manipulate the black lightning well.  The effect of the title also affected her.  It was her newly acquired title of “Manufacturer of Unreasonable”. This was very strong. Manufacturer of Unreasonable: A title given to those who have more than a certain amount of power are given when they fight on the battlefield where there are more than 30,000 enemies for a certain period of time and defeat more than 30,000 enemies. Effect: HP + 200, MP + 200, Strength + 100, Physical + 100, agility + 100, and Magic + 100.  All of this together, it seems that their status has increased at once. Since she would be further enhanced when awakened, she was probably one of the higher ranked A adventurers in the world.  I had thought it would be impossible for her to catch up with the Beast King and Ashwrath after seeing their stats.  But Fran now was sure that she would reach them one day.  Mea and Velmeria also earned this title.  However, it seems that she hasn’t earned Zefmate. It was hard to believe that the Holy Beast would have more than a certain amount of power after it became a holy beast, so the number of defeats it hadn’t reached. They were not very good at wide area attacks and there were also times when they would focus on decoys and support.  </p>
<p>「Urushi has gotten stronger too」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  Urushi, who had been eating the spicy curry as a reward, looked up at Fran’s words. He raised his voice happily, his mouth being as sticky as ever.  In Urushi’s case, his growth was not as strong as Fran’s, but his status had still increased as he leveled up. In addition, Urushi’s newly acquired title was more powerful. Inexhaustible Predator: A title earned by the magic beast that just ate it. Effect: A bonus for all predatory actions.  The effect was a little vague, but that was why the rank of this title was so high.  It was probably because it was the same as Extra Skills.  Perhaps it meant that the effects of skills such as Predation Assimilation would increase. It was a very useful skill for Urushi. </p>
<p>「We can still become stronger」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  Fran clenched her fists as she said that. Knowing that there was still a lot to go on, Fran, who was eager for strength, was burning.  Well, her eyes were focused on Urushi’s curry.Fran was also greedy to eat.</p>
