</div><h1>Chapter 992</h1><p>「Hmm? Come to think of it, Georg and the others brought Tilanaria and the girl with them, didn’t they? If that’s the case, then there’s still another one」</p>
<p>「...!」</p>
<p>Frederick was on the side against Trismegistus’ words. It was the same for Fran.</p>
<p>But how did they manage it so casually? If we had a relationship with the Dragon King, not only Frederick but Isario might become our enemy too, right?</p>
<p>I don’t think it was stupid enough to understand the danger...... Or was it because she was confident in her strength that she could make enemies?</p>
<p>As we were all thinking about something suspicious, Frederick asked her in a voice filled with rage.</p>
<p>「Are you working with the Dragon King?」</p>
<p>Frederick was mentally unstable now because of his increased power as an evil dragonkin. He would probably jump at him right away, no matter how many times he answered that.</p>
<p>In front of Frederick, who was giving off such a bomb-like aura, Trismegistus was not even slightly shaken. He easily opened his mouth, just like he had done before.</p>
<p>「Join hands? That’s not it.」</p>
<p>「Really? Even these guys are bad guys?」</p>
<p>「As a great sinner, I will not care about such things. In the first place, I am not interested in anything other than that. Evil people and good people, saintess and sinners are just as strangers to me. There is no further meaning than that.」</p>
<p>「You might be doing bad things in this castle」</p>
<p>「I have voluntarily set up restrictions on access to my castle. I will not refuse to come, I will not follow anyone who leaves. You people, do whatever you want. I will not reproach you, no matter what you do. Whether it is evil or good.」</p>
<p>He made Fran ask a question and used the Principal of Falsehood, but there was no slight lie in Trismegistus’ words. To this man, it seemed that he really didn’t care about other people.</p>
<p>No matter what he did in this castle, he was not interested in it as long as it didn’t get in his way. I see, I think I can get a glimpse of its monster nature.</p>
<p>「However, it is our pleasure to have more and more powerful people on this continent. That’s why we use the Red lotus blade. That’s not the case.」</p>
<p>It seems that Isario was the reason why this man, who said he was not interested in anyone, intentionally greeted the second unit.</p>
<p>She seemed to be somewhat interested in the strong, who would be a great help in accomplishing her mission of defeating the Abyss Eater.</p>
<p>「And then...... Is it possible that your little brother and this girl will help you defeat them eventually? Please do your best.」</p>
<p>As for the strength of an adventurer, they only care about us if we’re on par with Rank A. I don’t know if it’s a good thing to be interested in this man though.</p>
<p>In our case, they wanted to hear from her about an intelligence weapon, so we could say that it was a plus for her to remember her face.</p>
<p>『Fran, that’s not possible right now. It’s not something we can do right now』</p>
<p>「Nn... I have some business with you. Once things have settled down, I’d like to talk to you」</p>
<p>「I don’t mind. Is that what you want?」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「Come to think of it, this girl was after her goal. Well, let’s chase the Dragon King for now, okay?」</p>
<p>「I know.」</p>
<p>Right now, our priority is Velmeria and Frederick. Fran knows that too.</p>
<p>「Trismegistus-san, are the Dragon Kings still inside the castle?」</p>
<p>「They must have gone down to the basement with the priestesses.」</p>
<p>「Oi oi... By “underground” do you mean between the two nuclear weapons?」</p>
<p>「Impossible! Did you take Velmeria and Frederick over there? What’s Georg going to do?」</p>
<p>We were told that there was a nucleus of the Abyss Eater in the basement of this castle. In other words, the Dragon Kings must have gone there.</p>
<p>「At the north gate, it seems the outlaws were reluctant to send out their forces because of the impending war between the gangs.」</p>
<p>「It’s about time for extermination. If you come with us, we can do whatever we want」</p>
<p>「I guess I’ll take his word for it.」</p>
<p>However, the entire army could not immediately follow them. The “Nucleus” area seemed to be a place where powerful antidemons spring up, and not a place where all the troops here could rush in.</p>
<p>Trismegistus was forced to keep cutting down the Abyss Eater due to Divine Punishment.</p>
<p>They defeated the high-level antidemons born in the underground facility while dying on the verge of death, and attacked the Abyss Eater’s core until it ran out of magic power. The content of the Divine Punishment was to keep that process going on and on on on on a daily basis.</p>
<p>「Me and Miss Frederick are going in.」</p>
<p>「Understood」</p>
<p>Isario must have been considering the Divine Sword Release as well. If he ever goes to the small underground with a large army, he will surely be caught up in it.</p>
<p>The adventurers seemed to understand that as well, and nodded in frustration.</p>
<p>We stepped into the castle, led by the leisurely walk of Trismegistus. Without looking back at us, he walked straight through the castle.</p>
<p>They were all lined with various furniture, and the walls and other parts of the room were decorated with fine arts. All of them seemed to be in perfect condition.</p>
<p>Isario gave us a brief description of how he sensed Fran’s doubts.</p>
<p>「I heard that this castle was maintained by the power of the Gods」</p>
<p>「Is the Gods wiping it?」</p>
<p>「Hahaha. It seems that time has been fixed since the day the Divine Punishment was imposed. They managed to regenerate even if it was destroyed, and the furniture can’t even cross the barrier of the hill」</p>
<p>「Why?」</p>
<p>「That’s what the Gods were thinking after all. However, there was a tremendous amount of goods stored in this castle. The dragonkin were said to be in a lot of trouble because they would not be able to carry it out after all」</p>
<p>Did he just remove the treasury not only from Trismegistus, but also from the dragonkin under his command?</p>
<p>An uncontrollable treasure that would remain clean and never faded, and a magnificent castle. It may be a symbol of great crime and a predicament to greed.</p>
<p>「Here.」</p>
<p>At Trismegistus’ invitation, we arrived at the throne room.</p>
<p>The room was large enough for hundreds of people, but Fran was the only one in there. The room was huge, which made me feel the chill of being uninhabited.</p>
<p>Trismegistus approached the throne. He didn’t seem to be trying to sit there, but to take the sword from the side.</p>
<p>It was the elegant curve of the silver Falcion. It was a magic sword with both boldness and beauty that could be recognized as a work of art at first sight.</p>
<p>That sword, by any chance――</p>
<p>Trismegistus grabbed the bare Falcion and muttered.</p>
<p>「Today is the time for atonement. Come on, Juanaverta.」</p>
