</div><h1>Chapter 1051</h1><p>Marl, who had turned into an ice demon, approached Fran. He was in a rundown state, but it seemed that he had improved his magic operations. He didn’t chant magic and activated multiple spells at the same time. Moreover, his physical abilities and defenses had also increased. </p>
<p>「Wrrrooof!」</p>
<p>「Mwah!」</p>
<p>『This is bad!』</p>
<p> Marl’s arm suddenly stretched out like Camellion’s tongue. He approached Fran at super high speed. Fran quickly dodged her arm, but the long arm immediately changed its movement. It deflected and swelled as if it were a whip, engulfing the entire area. With a jerk, it swelled as if it were a whip, engulfing the entire area.  The arm, which looked like it was made of ice, moved surprisingly smoothly.  Normally, it would have been a dangerous attack, but Fran was used to dealing with whips. After all, in the Plains of the Demon Wolf, she had been in a long mock battle with the world’s best whip users. </p>
<p>『Thank you Amanda!』</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>  She saw through Marl’s complicated movements and completely dodged his arm.  However, Marl’s courageousness was beyond anyone’s imagination. To my surprise, when I thought that the raging ice arm had unleashed strong magic power, it suddenly caused a huge explosion.  On the surrounding surface of the sea, an upside-down ice column stood as if to shock the sky, and the white mist covered the area. Although the barrier had blocked the great damage, his left arm was covered in frost, causing a frozen wound.  The inside of the blade would be frozen. While healing with Heal, I used Fire Magic to melt the ice.  </p>
<p>『You attacked us at the expense of your own arm』</p>
<p>(It was too dangerous for me.  If Master hadn’t put up a barrier, my whole body might have frozen)</p>
<p>『Fran, Marl is――it’s coming!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  Marl’s presence rushed towards us. He pierced through the white cold wall and appeared with Marl in his arms. He then swung down the great sword of ice in his hand toward Fran’s head.  </p>
<p>「Grrrr!」</p>
<p>「Shii!」</p>
<p> It was certainly faster and sharper, but it was not enough to beat Fran in melee combat.  </p>
<p>「Seyaaaa!」</p>
<p>  Fran calmly handled the greatsword and slammed me into Marl’s right arm. The fire attribute sword and Marl’s ice competed for just a moment, causing vapor to rise. It seemed that by conducting magic power to the ice around her, she could raise her defenses at a pinpoint.  But I couldn’t stop her now.  The power of her slash was only a little slower, but it was really only a little. I sliced off Marl’s arm more easily than slashing the tofu.  I could see the arms that were separated from her body turn into magic and melt into the void.  </p>
<p>(It always grew even when cut!)</p>
<p>『It looked like it had absorbed the sea water』</p>
<p>  Marl then sucked up the surrounding sea water and grew the arms that had been cut off in an instant.  It seemed that Marl’s body was now completely made of ice. His face was already showing the face of the original person, but the icy parts of his body may no longer be human. </p>
<p>『But still, it’s gonna be quite hard to defeat him on the sea, isn’t it?』</p>
<p>(... Nn.)</p>
<p>  He still hadn’t made up his mind.  I never thought that Fran would be so upset...  He was the same age, the same sex, and illegal slaves. The fact that they were combined completely overlapped with her.  Fran must not think that she could save the current Marl. She knew that it would be dangerous not only for her, but also for the town if she didn’t defeat it. I could feel that she was putting more strength into her hand holding me and was trying to get prepared.  However, she still hadn’t made up her mind to kill him.  She clenched her teeth and glared at him.  If the current Fran, who had grown up, were serious, it would not be difficult to win against him. Even so, Fran was unable to take her first step.  It couldn’t be helped.  I guess she’ll have to buy some more time. </p>
<p>『Fran, why don’t you guide Marl and attack the other ships?』</p>
<p>(?)</p>
<p>『Probably, I think that barrier has the power to select what’s passed through and what’s not』</p>
<p>  Otherwise, the ship wouldn’t be able to come back from the outside, and even shots from inside could cause a barrier.  It was very likely that it had some kind of formula to select enemy and friend. If so, what about Marl?  Since we were aboard a water dragonkin, wouldn’t it be possible for us to pass through the barrier? Then, what if we led him to the center of the fleet that was protected by the barrier in his current outburst?  </p>
<p>(I see!)</p>
<p>『I think it’s worth a shot』</p>
<p>(Okay!)</p>
<p> Fran immediately made a decision and flew backwards to leave Marl.  </p>
<p>『Urushi!  We’ll now lead Marl to the center of the fleet!  Be careful!』</p>
<p>(Woof!)</p>
<p>「Grrrr!」</p>
<p>  As expected, Marl’s reason was getting blown away.  He then rushed in a straight line as Fran ran off. Moreover, he unleashed ice and snow magic.  He didn’t seem to care about the line of fire at all. We saw an ice bullet that we dodged thrust into the side of a nearby enemy ship. It was not much damage for a large ship, but I could tell that Marl was no longer concerned about killing each other. If we could unleash even more of our big move, we might be able to do a lot of damage to the enemy fleet.  </p>
<p>『Our destination is the water dragonkin!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
