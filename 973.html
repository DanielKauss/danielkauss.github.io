</div><h1>Chapter 973</h1><p>The giant-type that rampaged in the town of Should was different from the giant-type from the one in the sate. </p>
<p>「There’s some kind of turban」</p>
<p>『Besides, the balance of limbs is quite different too』</p>
<p> The giant-type of the sate was a flimsy chimpanzee-type, while the giant-type of the shoulds was like a macho in armor with spikes. Its arms and legs were thick, and it was clearly higher in power. Moreover, it was clearly tall. There was so much difference that it could be seen clearly. There were so many differences that I could tell the difference.  Is the variety of giant-types different? No, did they grow up?  If they were like babies before moving, they might grow by the magic power they absorb. And there were even more people in this town, which was larger than the Sante, and the amount of power they could absorb from their magic absorption was enormous. When I thought about it as a result, I understood the difference from the Sante.  </p>
<p>「Isario, what do you want to do?」</p>
<p>「I have to drag her out of town like when we’re at the Sante. Can you put him in a decoy again, young miss?」</p>
<p>「Leave it to me.」</p>
<p>  Isario didn’t hesitate and gave Fran a dangerous role. The adventurers around us didn’t disagree with that either.  It meant that Fran was completely recognized as a senior adventurer. They were happy to be on such a dangerous mission.  </p>
<p>『Fran, you look more powerful than the giant-types of sates. Don’t let your guards down.』</p>
<p>  However, the method was the same.  Fran and Urushi moved away and provoked them, and the soldiers standing behind them attacked from the outside of the wall with long-range attacks. Just like that, they would guide the giant-type and kill them all at once.  Since we had already experienced this once, the deployment of the second unit was quick.  Fortunately, the giant-type was close to the wall. It would take them a long time to lure them out of the city if we could move further into the center of the town. Once we were sure that the refugees in the city were quite far away, we started to move.  </p>
<p>「Hah!」</p>
<p>「Uuooh!」</p>
<p>  Fran hit the giant-type with her intimidation skill, and Urushi provoked them with his roar skill. At this rate, it should be able to lead him to the outside of the wall in about a dozen seconds.  We continued to provoke him, paying attention to his extended hand. </p>
<p>「Ruuaaaaaaaagh!」</p>
<p>「Kang?」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>『W-what!?』</p>
<p>  The giant-type suddenly bent its hips. It slowed down, but it bent its hips dexterously and reached for its right hand to thrust its claws at the ground. I didn’t expect it to show such flexibility since I had seen the hard movements of the giant-type in my head.  The giant-type of the shorz that stood up raised its right hand in the astonishment of us.  It was just like a baseball pitching form. No, in fact, it was just a movement to throw things.  </p>
<p>「Ruaaaah!」</p>
<p>『!』</p>
<p>  Just like the sate, it had been throwing rubble at us.  However, unlike the giant-type of the sate, which relied on heavy blows, this rubble was enveloped in a dense magical power. The power was probably on a different level.  Moreover, the speed was incomparable. I thought he had swung his arm down, but there were already countless rocks in front of us.  He quickly stowed away the rocks on the direct hit course and hit the surrounding rocks with his telekinesis.  However, the telekinetic layer, which was extended with a focus on wide range, could not stop the rocks from flying at high speed. Most of the rocks pierced through their telekinesis and flew behind us, though their power was probably a little less.  Fran and Urushi may have slammed down a few of them, but at most about ten of them. The scattered shots of the rocks that the giant-types had thrown at us rained down on the soldiers in the back. I saw a few of the walls that you had created with your land magic being caught and crushed. Isario also seemed to have repelled them with his Divine Sword, but he hadn’t been able to block them all.  In the end, about ten rocks had pierced into the second unit, killing and wounding more than ten times the soldiers. Several soldiers were crushed and flying in the air like dead leaves.  </p>
<p>「Ruuuu」</p>
<p>『We’re coming again!』</p>
<p>「I’ll protect everyone!  Urushi! Full speed!」</p>
<p>「Grr!」</p>
<p>  As for me, I think it was best to go back to the second unit and strengthen our defense.  However, Fran seemed to be trying to crush the attack itself. She ran Urushi toward the huge arm that the giant-type raised.  </p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>「Grrrr!」</p>
<p>『Kanna Kamui!』</p>
<p>  My magic struck the giant arm, but it didn’t go as far as to crush it. To my surprise, she seemed to have reduced the damage by concentrating her magic power on her arm.  However, she had stopped throwing to regenerate the damage. Then, Fran’s slash was fired from the back of Urushi, who was running at high speed. Fran’s face was frowned upon with a high-pitched sound as if metal was clashing with metal. </p>
<p>「H-tai!」</p>
<p>『Seriously!?』</p>
<p>  Even without the use of Sword God Transformation or Brilliant Lightning Rush, Urushi’s speed was increased.  His slash must have been quite powerful. In fact, more than half of the giant-type arms of the sate had been torn off.  However, it seemed that the durability of the giant-type of shorz, which was concentrating its magic power, was orders of magnitude greater. To my surprise, they were only able to cut through about a tenth of its true strength.  </p>
<p>「Urushi!  One more!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p> It turned around Urushi as he passed each other, but the arm of the giant-type was already swinging down.  </p>
<p>「Ruoughoooourgh!」</p>
<p>『This is bad!  I can’t store it in that position!』</p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>「Grrrr!」</p>
<p>  The magic that Fran and the others unleashed, trying to hinder his movement, was blown away by his hard arms. And again, the countless rocks in his palm were released at super high speed.  With a tremendous boom, countless rocks were thrust at the feet of the giant. It was a throwing failure. </p>
<p>「Master, what’s wrong?」</p>
<p>『Yeah! A little bit with telekinesis』</p>
<p>  What I did was to envelope the giant’s hand with telekinesis. The telekinesis was not very well kneaded, and I could only hinder the giant’s movement for a moment.  But that was enough. When catching a ball, they may fail and throw a one-bound ball, or worse, they may throw it directly down. That was a failure that occurred when she threw the ball further ahead without releasing the ball with an ideal release point. I used telekinesis to delay the timing of the giant’s hand opening even for a moment, causing release points to go crazy. I was worried about how effective the telekinetic blockage would be in front of the giant’s pure physical strength, but it was far more effective than I had imagined.  Come to think of it, there was no unnecessary force applied to the fist when throwing something.  Rather, it was important to not use too much force. Therefore, even the wide telekinesis was able to hinder her fist’s opening more than I had imagined.  Even if she didn’t know what she had done, she probably thought that Fran had interfered.  </p>
<p>「Ruuuh!」</p>
<p>『Look at me!</p>
<p>「Just like I wished!」</p>
