</div><h1>Chapter 1025</h1><p>「You used up all of it...? What do you mean?」</p>
<p>The Silver Lady suddenly appeared and saved us. Fran asked her back if she felt anything in her words, “Use my body to its full potential”.</p>
<p>But the Silver Lady did not answer the question, dodging magic bullets from antidemons and shadowing her hand at me.</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>「Intelligence-sharing... Securing more networks.」</p>
<p>『W-What are you doing?』</p>
<p>「We share information with our kin.」</p>
<p>《Yes. Confirming the sharing of information and areas. The function has been temporarily restored》</p>
<p>You’re the same type, Announcer-san huh!? It seems that Announcer-san was temporarily awakened by some kind of connection with the Silver Lady. She’s too reliable with reinforcements in this last moment!</p>
<p>《Jump. Teleport.》</p>
<p>『O-ou!』</p>
<p>Maybe it was thanks to Announcer-san’s support, I was convinced that I could teleport without any problems. Following that feeling, I activated my long-distance teleport.</p>
<p>Thanks to her great distance from the giant antidemons, our pursuit stopped. But the Silver Lady’s true goal was not to bring Announcer-san back to life and let us escape.</p>
<p>The Silver Lady and Announcer-san then started a sort of exchange in a mechanical voice.</p>
<p>「Obtained.」</p>
<p>《Synchronization complete... Is that good?》</p>
<p>「No problem. It’s much more meaningful than just rotting away.」</p>
<p>《......I won’t waste any of it.》</p>
<p>「Thank you very much」</p>
<p>What did she mean? She seemed to understand what she was going to do next by sharing information at a deeper level though...</p>
<p>『Hey, hey. What are you talking about?』</p>
<p>I felt a somewhat disturbing atmosphere. My danger detection wasn’t working, but can I let them continue what they were trying to do?</p>
<p>《I’m sorry, but I need it》</p>
<p>「It’s my responsibility. You don’t have to worry about it」</p>
<p>『So! What are you――?』</p>
<p>It was just as I was about to ask for more details.</p>
<p>My blade lifted――or should I say, scythe.</p>
<p>『Wha!?』</p>
<p>「Master!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>My voice of astonishment overlapped with Urushi’s screams coming from Fran and the shadows.</p>
<p>「Why!」</p>
<p>『I-it’s not me! Announcer-san! What the hell is that!?』</p>
<p>My sword blade moved on its own and pierced through the Silver Lady’s chest. I guess because she didn’t expect me to make such a move, Fran couldn’t just stop the hand holding me.</p>
<p>Her eyes widened as she looked at her arm, as if she couldn’t believe the feeling coming from her hand.</p>
<p>She had moved me just now, Announcer-san. Were they not friendly? While we were getting flustered, the Silver Lady shook her head with the same excitement as before.</p>
<p>「Don’t worry, that’s what I wished for」</p>
<p>「Why......?」</p>
<p>「Just like I said before. To make effective use of my body」</p>
<p>The Silver Lady gently put her hand on my blade, which pierced herself, and smiled.</p>
<p>「You ready, aren’t you?」</p>
<p>《Yes. Integration will begin》</p>
<p>Immediately after, I could feel a huge amount of power flowing into me. It was not just that magic power was being supply to me.</p>
<p>Something more important. I felt as if my system was being filled with strange power and strengthened.</p>
<p>『T-This is......!』</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>Fran tried to pull me out, but she couldn’t. With me, the Silver Lady’s body was pulled away and she fell into Fran’s hand.</p>
<p>The Silver Lady’s body, carried by Fran, did not move at all. It looked like a corpse, but it was already a golem without blood and flesh. It was hard to tell what she was in.</p>
<p>The Silver Lady was carried by Fran’s arm, but she soon began to change. Her entire body glowed faintly, and then began to crumble as particles of light from the tips of her hair and fingers.</p>
<p>「My body!」</p>
<p>「No problem」</p>
<p>I knew it was powerful, but to think it was a failed divine sword!</p>
<p>《No problem. Please accept it as it is》</p>
<p>『No, it’s nothing!』</p>
<p>The light from the transformation of the Silver Lady’s body gathered around me as if pulled back to my blade. Not only that, but it was clearly absorbed into me.</p>
<p>But that was not what I was doing.</p>
<p>It seems both Announcer-san and the Silver Lady were working together.</p>
<p>Before I was even surprised, I could feel the power returning. The power that had been worn out and worn out on this continent had healed. On the contrary, it had strengthened.</p>
<p>Especially Announcer-san.</p>
<p>『Announcer-san... I may be able to feel it, Announcer-san.』</p>
<p>《This is probably because by absorbing the power of the individual named Announcer-san, the available area for the individual named Announcer-san has been temporarily expanded》</p>
<p>『Should temporary things be restored immediately?』</p>
<p>《In this state, the temporary named Master will be under a great burden. We will immediately return to him》</p>
<p>『And the bearer of hope, you mean the Silver Lady?』</p>
<p>《Affirmative.》</p>
<p>A bearer of hope...... That was the name that the Divine level blacksmith Zechs gave her.</p>
<p>I don’t know what kind of person she was, but I’m sure she wanted to defeat the antidemons somehow. To do that, she must have raised Overgrowth and created the Silver Lady, the bearer of it.</p>
<p>『Hey, is this the right thing to do? Trying to give my power to him or her......』</p>
<p>「Yes. I thought this was best for me to make my Lord’s wishes come true and to leave a proof of my existence」</p>
<p>《All the absorbed information will be returned in sync》</p>
<p>『Whoa!』</p>
<p>The power I felt faintly increased my presence. And I felt a clear sense of form within me.</p>
<p>『Is the flow of magic... getting better?』</p>
<p>《The ‘magician’ possessed by the individual named Master has evolved into the ‘Great Magician’》</p>
<p>You can control your magic however you want! With this, you can perfectly use both extreme magic and skills!</p>
<p>The Silver Lady smiled, perhaps because she could feel the emotion I was happy about. This was a beautiful smile, unlike any golem.</p>
<p>「It is an honor to be of service to you. I was able to carry hope at the end of my life......?」</p>
<p>『!』</p>
<p>The body of the bearer of hope shone brighter than before and turned rapidly into light.</p>
<p>『Yeah! This power! It’s the best hope for us right now!』</p>
<p>「Fufu, thank you...」</p>
<p>After hearing her words, the bearer of hope was sucked into me. I didn’t see her anymore, but I definitely feel a new power. As her name implied, she was a power of hope.</p>
<p>『Thank you very much』</p>
