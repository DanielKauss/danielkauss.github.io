</div><h1>Chapter 1109</h1><p>After we passed through the tornado, we saw Klimut lying on the ground in front of us. Fran was running toward him in a hurry.</p>
<p>No more wind attacks. Maybe it’s because we’re near Klimt?</p>
<p>「Klimt! Are you okay?」</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>Klimt’s blue face must have moved lightly as he nodded his head. However, he did not seem to be talking.</p>
<p>「The Black Lightning Princess!」</p>
<p>「Fran! If things continue like this, Klimut-dono will take a hit!」</p>
<p>Klimt seemed to have had a deep wound in his stomach. Zenos had hit the cloth on his wounds to try to stop him from bleeding, while Urushi tilted his body to prevent his wounds from going downward while being wary of his surroundings.</p>
<p>Klimt himself didn’t move at all and seemed to be concentrating on something... But Klimt’s spirit couldn’t heal its wounds, right?</p>
<p>「Recovery now.」</p>
<p>Fran used maximal heals. However, Klimut’s wounds did not heal.</p>
<p>「Eh?」</p>
<p>『It’s Evil Spirit!』</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection, I found that there was evil energy clinging to the wound. It seemed to have penetrated into Klimut’s body as well, and that it was holding him back from healing.</p>
<p>Zenos and Urushi looked desperate.</p>
<p>「Even the Black Lightning Princess won’t be able to do it......!」</p>
<p>「We’ll be in trouble! If things continue like this, even the town of Alessa will be destroyed......!」</p>
<p>「What happened?」</p>
<p>「We don’t know much about that either」</p>
<p>Zenos then took Klimt’s role and explained it to us. He told us that an intruder had suddenly appeared in the feudal lord’s building. Klimt’s spirits and knights went to intercept him, but...</p>
<p>「I found out they’ve entered the room.」</p>
<p>「I didn’t notice it either. It was an undead man with terrifyingly little presence」</p>
<p>It seems that their combat power itself was lower than Urushi’s, but they had trouble with their concealment ability, which made them lose sight of even in front of them, allowing them to approach us.</p>
<p>The undead seemed to have been aiming for Klimut from the beginning and jumped at him with a throwaway. The barrier that the spirit was aiming for was supposed to repell the attack, but the barrier was easily broken and Klimut took a hit of the dagger in his stomach.</p>
<p>(Hydman?)</p>
<p>『It seems that other than the one we defeated, they were still lurking around...』</p>
<p>Should we look deeper!? If things weren’t going well, it’s even possible that the one we defeated was the one who dared to be defeated by exposing himself. That way, we could let our guard down and let Klimt get the real deal out of him.</p>
<p>「What about that undead?」</p>
<p>「Klimt defeated it. No, it might be more correct to say that he got caught up in the appearance of the Great Spirit and was defeated...」</p>
<p>「Only the remains of the undead and the dagger are there.」</p>
<p>She said that a dagger emitting magic power had fallen a little farther away. On the other side of it, only the upper half of the undead body had collapsed.</p>
<p>「Klimt-dono needs to move to control the great spirit that came out to the outside. Because of this, he can’t escape and stay here」</p>
<p>「Even Klimt can’t seem to completely suppress it though」</p>
<p>It seems that the reason why Klimt was not violent, even if it only attacked close people, was that he was in complete control. However, he seemed to be unable to move because he used all his might.</p>
<p>I guess it was not only because of her wounds that she didn’t talk, but because she had to concentrate on controlling the Great Spirit of Wind.</p>
<p>『Fran, let’s start by healing Klimut with all our might』</p>
<p>(Got it.)</p>
<p>I don’t know what would happen to the Great Spirit if Klimt were to lose consciousness. We then used healing magic with the Divine Attribute. Instead of emitting a series of shots, we healed little by little without panic with an image of penetrating deeper.</p>
<p>The experience of healing Fran, who had been wounded by a demon killer, lived here. Evil spirits and demon killers are different, but the condition of the wounds is very similar. The wounds in her stomach, which were completely meaningless with ordinary magic, were slowly starting to close.</p>
<p>「Oh! That’s the Black Lightning Princess!」</p>
<p>「Alright! Just a little more!」</p>
<p>The two were overjoyed, but soon they wouldn’t be able to say that.</p>
<p>「...Muh」</p>
<p>『What’s wrong, Fran?』</p>
<p>(The Great Spirit made me even louder)</p>
<p>『What?』</p>
<p>The next moment, several tornadoes released by the Great Spirit rose to the nobles district.</p>
<p>「......Grgh.」</p>
<p>「Klimt, are you okay?」</p>
<p>Klimt nodded with a more painful expression than before. It seemed that the wound, which was slowly closing up, was disrupting Klimt’s concentration.</p>
<p>Maybe he was feeling some kind of pain or itch. But we couldn’t just stop healing him here.</p>
<p>「Klimt, do your best」</p>
<p>「......Guh.」</p>
<p>Klimt groaned and nodded clearly. Her eyes still had a strong power behind them. In the first place, it was amazing that she was able to keep the Great Spirit under control in this situation.</p>
<p>(Master, rush)</p>
<p>『Yeah.』</p>
<p>However, Klimt might be surprised if she suddenly increased her recovery speed. We gradually increased the percentage of the divine attribute in her body, and slowly but surely, she recovered.</p>
<p>Klimt seemed to have gotten used to the feeling of the wound slowly closing up along the way, and the Great Spirit did not go out of control beyond what was necessary.</p>
<p>After recovering completely, he stood up with a slightly relieved look on his face. His job was not over yet.</p>
<p>「Phew...... It quells the great spirit」</p>
<p>「Nn. Please」</p>
<p>I had to reseal the great spirit that had been released.</p>
