</div><h1>Chapter 934</h1><p>「Auntie......? Fran went to Mulsani’s mansion and was invited in as soon as she told her name. It seems that Fran had been told to the people of the merchant association. Mulsani wasn’t doing any work, but the maid took her to Nadia’s room. It was small and not very luxurious. But it was a room that I could tell was well-cleaned and well-kept. I guess she thought about Nadia’s hobbies and decided to choose the best room for us. She probably gave us the best room considering Nadia’s hobbies.  </p>
<p>「She won’t wake up」</p>
<p>『I felt nothing wrong with it, but...』</p>
<p>  Even the use of healing magic and life magic did not change Nadia’s condition, just like Fran and Urushi after the battle against Sendia. Just like Fran and Urushi after the defense of Sendia.  No, Nadia was probably more tattered and badly worn out inside.  </p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>  Fran sat down at her bedside chair, silently staring at Nadia’s face.  For a little while, gentle time passed. But Fran stood up with a new look of determination. </p>
<p>「Master, let’s go to the guild.  Are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Nn.  You’ll be offended by an aunt if you work hard. </p>
<p>『I see.』</p>
<p>  Fran finally stroked Nadia’s face lightly and turned her back to the bed.  </p>
<p>「Auntie, you can see that Fran was quietly motivated. If the Dragon King’s devious plan continues, this Nocta could be in danger. She needed to do her job to protect Nadia, and to crush the Dragon King and the black market slavers to regain her composure on this continent. After leaving the mansion, Fran rushed to the guild without buying any food.  But we didn’t have to just give her the letter. Naturally, Fran, who was active in Sendia, wanted to talk to her.  Fran then explained the situation in her own words, albeit with a poor tone. Well, it was basically about the Dragon King’s actions.  </p>
<p>「Thanks for the information. I’ll go find out about the Dragon King too, you know.  Please.  Still, I didn’t know that Sendia had been hunted that far......  I’ll save you with accurate information. To be honest, the information was too mixed, so I don’t know what was right.」</p>
<p>  It’s been quite a while since the battle ended, so there seems to be a lot of information coming to Nocta. However, there was clearly conflicting information, so it was impossible to know which one was the truth.  A Divine Sword user appeared.  A Divine Dragon user appeared.  A Divine Dragon user appeared.  He was attacked by one million antidemons and was killed.  The saintess died.  No wait, it’s Sendia’s wielder. The Beastmen did their best.  There was too much information, from silly to truth-telling. The information was more false than false this time.There was too much information, from silly to telling the truth.  Moreover, the information that was absurd this time was more truthful, which made things more complicated.  However, the information about Fran and Mea may not have spread as far as I was worried.  Especially in the case of Fran and Mea, I didn’t know what kind of state they were in. At least we didn’t seem to get any information on the Divine Beast or the White Beast.  We just blurted out about the Divine Sword and the Divine Beast and reported the misdeeds of the Dragon King.  They might not suddenly believe everything, but the Adventurer’s Guild was on our side. There was no doubt that the Sendia guild master was killed by the dragonkin.  The situation was clearly hostile.  Well, I won’t let you down.  </p>
<p>「... She’s meat, wholesaling?」</p>
<p>「That’s good to hear!」</p>
<p>  It’s still half-eaten!  It’s not a bribe, but we’ll serve you meat at a reasonable price.  And if there’s meat, then a party, of course. Well, this time, it was a request from the guildmasters.  They seemed to want to get some gas out of it before the adventurers who had continued the series of battles were dissatisfied.  They would go to the neighboring cities to support them tomorrow, so I had to refrain from drinking. I’ll serve a little bit of it though. </p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Wahahahaha!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「To the meat lady!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>  However, they had forgotten that the number of adventurers was increasing. Also, many people who failed to attend the last party had come running in one after another.  I guess they had asked their friends and acquaintances to let me know when a party was going to be held. The number of adventurers, including demonkin and dwarven adventurers, was more than twice as many as last time.  It also takes time to dismantle the necessary amount. Meanwhile, more adventurers must have gathered.  The guildmaster asked them to let out wild meat because I’ll give them a asking price, so we can’t go easy on them!</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「We are adventurers~... ♪」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「The golden adventurers~... ♪」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>  The song choir began, and Fran joined in.  It was a song Fran had been listening to all along in the battle, and now she’s her favorite song.  The lyrics were perfect.  We baked the meat and sang it together.  Aah, it was Fran and Urushi who ate the most while grilling it. It was rather, they were cooking their portions for themselves and doing it on the stove. As we were holding a large party, we saw a man come into the underground training hall.  There was a reason why we noticed them among all the adventurers.  </p>
<p>(Master, that sword......)</p>
<p>(Woof)</p>
<p>『It’s definitely a Divine Sword.  Gaia, Lindwurm, and Oratorio.  It seemed that after seeing several Divine Swords, we began to sense the presence of the Divine Sword.  Well, it was a sort of half-intuition, but this time it was certain. After all, the three of us felt the same way. Such a man walked toward us with a leisurely gait.  </p>
<p>(...Strong?)</p>
<p>『I don’t know, I don’t know...  I don’t know how weak the wielder of the Divine Sword is』</p>
<p>  We stared at the man, but we couldn’t quite understand his strength.  He looked strong or weak. In other words, it must be so high that even we couldn’t see his ability.A monster like that was right in front of us.</p>
