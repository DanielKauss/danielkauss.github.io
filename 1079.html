</div><h1>Chapter 1079</h1><p>The adventurer’s guild hasn’t started interrogation of Derick――. It will need Satya’s help to pull information from him, but bringing her to the interrogation is said to be her last resort.</p>
<p>Regardless of what would happen to his future treatment, he is certainly not able to easily rely on the royalty of other countries. If he was the master of the Adventurer’s Guild, he would have to make a request, but it seemed that it was not good for him to be the substitute for the feudal lord this time.</p>
<p>The nobles, of course, would like to avoid doing anything that could put their country at a disadvantage as much as possible.</p>
<p>However, Derick could not open his mouth with some pain. Fran then grabbed Derick’s chest holding him staring at us with dark eyes.</p>
<p>「......Goho!」</p>
<p>「Oi, spit all out」</p>
<p>Fran responded with intimidation and killing intent that could make a normal person go insane, in contrast to the delinquent who was chomping and coughing. But this man would never talk about such a thing. Even though he was an enemy, his patience was worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>Fran threw Derick on the floor and pointed me at him. There was a look of trouble on her face. I guess she couldn’t come up with any way to get him to talk. Would she really need Satya’s help?</p>
<p>「A magic potion that can make your mouth shut?」</p>
<p>「A magic potion for confessing, huh? It’s not in our town. It’s treated as a dangerous drug, so you can apply to the government and have it screened」</p>
<p>In that case, it would be faster to send her to the Royal Capital, wouldn’t it?</p>
<p>I was born several decades ago, it seems. Not that it means much to me considering how I don’t remember living that long myself.</p>
<p>In the midst of all this, Urushi slowly approached the delinquent. He stood in front of them, snapped his mouth open and tried to intimidate them. No, he wasn’t intimidating them.</p>
<p>「Woof―」</p>
<p>「!! Gwah!」</p>
<p>Urushi let out a gray smoke from his mouth. Derick quickly closed his mouth and eyes and turned away.</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>「Ghaah... Ghaah!」</p>
<p>However, when Urushi pushed his belly with his paw, he couldn’t help but cough. He had inhaled a lot of smoke.</p>
<p>「Arf!」</p>
<p>「...Kuh」</p>
<p>As if floating on a high heat, delicate’s cheeks turned red and his mouth became half-open. In addition, Urushi was bombarded with gray smoke many times already.</p>
<p>『Could this be the way Satya used multiple poisons to deprive you of your judgment?』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>To my surprise, she was able to understand Satya’s method and do it herself with just one look. It was an amazing learning experience.</p>
<p>『Well done, Urushi!』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>『Fran, let’s ask him a few questions.』</p>
<p>「Nn. So, it was your friends who appeared in Barbra?」</p>
<p>「Yeah...」</p>
<p>Alright, Urushi’s poison was working fine too. He was answering Fran’s question.</p>
<p>The information we got was the same as before, but we certainly supported the report.</p>
<p>What the guildmaster was most interested in was the story of a spy for the Kingdom of Raidos. If someone from Philias tried to make use of the wolf in the village of Kranzel, how would he deal with that story on Kranzel’s side?</p>
<p>「There’s an adventurer connected to the Raidos Kingdom running into this town as a witness, huh?」</p>
<p>Apparently, spies sent by the Kingdom of Raidos were among the adventurers in Dards. They were originally guards of the Morley Trading Company, which the Kingdom of Raidos used as a front, and were actually agents of the Kingdom of Raidos.</p>
<p>Fran had forgotten about it, but I remembered. Khanna, who we met on the way to the Belios Kingdom, was supposed to be the daughter of the Morley Trading Company.</p>
<p>At that time, Fran was still only aware of a country that was a little annoying to Raidos. So, I’m sure we wouldn’t miss it now.</p>
<p>「Let’s try searching for someone from the Morley Trading Company. I also want to detain any adventurers who come to report about Metelmum」</p>
<p>We tried to continue the interrogation, but Derick stopped saying anything. Apparently, he was too worn out and unconscious. Judging from the fact that even recovery magic could not heal him, he must be mentally drained.</p>
<p>Still, with his strength recovering, he seemed to be able to talk a little more openly and slowly, but he began to talk again.</p>
<p>There were plenty of things we couldn’t let him spit out along the way. Among them, there was the worst.</p>
<p>「The second group is heading to the south-eastern part of the Kingdom of Kranzel, including Barbra」</p>
<p>It seems that the Kingdom of Raidos had originally planned to challenge Barbra in two stages.</p>
<p>It would be fine if the first group, including the water dragonkin, could attack us. If it was not, the second group, which was waiting for Seedrun, would attack us. That was how the plan was made.</p>
<p>Both the Kingdom of Kranzel and the Kingdom of Raydoss, which the adventurers underestimated, seemed to be wary of us at the top of the line.</p>
<p>And it seemed that the second group was not limited to the invasion from the sea.</p>
<p>The Kingdom of Shallus, which was located in the south of Barbra, had already been captured by the Kingdom of Raidos, and from there, a large army was planned to attack the Kingdom of Kranzel.</p>
<p>The force that defeated the water dragonkin in the first group would not be so good against the two ships. While they were luring the defense force of the south-eastern Kranzel to Barbra, the force that invaded from the Kingdom of Shallus was a strategy to storm the south of Kranzel.</p>
<p>「Shallus Kingdom......?」</p>
<p>『I heard that in Ulmut. It was probably a small country that had been making a lot of noise after all』</p>
<p>(Oh, I see.)</p>
<p>『You don’t remember, right?』</p>
<p>Fran seemed to have forgotten, but she had been persistently recruiting people to cause a commotion with adventurers. They were probably Raidos’ puppets from that moment on.</p>
<p>When she heard the danger of Bulbola, Fran couldn’t stay put.</p>
<p>「I’m going」</p>
<p>「It’s not like I’m scouting the village by myself, is it? No matter how much I have an alias......」</p>
<p>「Don’t worry」</p>
<p>「......Do you think we can win?」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「...Okay. I’ll send you a request form. It must be a defense request」</p>
<p>Whoa! Thank you for that! Fran would go regardless of whether we had a request or not, but it’s better for her to be a merit!</p>
<p>(Nn! But first――)</p>
<p>『Fran?』</p>
<p>(This guy will definitely escape at this rate.)</p>
<p>Fran pulls me out and stands in front of Derick. I guess the operatives of Raidos would think of me as just a goblin or a bandit anymore. His eyes were on Derick’s limbs.</p>
<p>And the tragedy that was caused by it. To put it bluntly, I think it would be better to force her to become a slave than to lose her limbs... But to Fran, becoming a slave was not the same thing as that.</p>
<p>Moreover, Satya pushed Fran to the side against Derick, who had been transferred to prison.</p>
<p>「Out. A heart demon.」</p>
<p>「Kyii!」</p>
<p>「I’m gonna neutralize this guy and keep an eye on him.」</p>
<p>「Key!」</p>
<p>Satya summoned a small demon as small as an Imp. When the monster’s figure faded, it disappeared as if it was sucked into a delicate being.</p>
<p>「It’s a heart of laziness. Although I don’t think I can completely nullify a person as powerful as Drick, it is still possible to deprive him of his physical and mental strength」</p>
<p>In short, they seemed to be lazy and able to make people do not want to do anything. They had lost their limbs and had been monitored by demons. As expected, they would not be able to escape in this state. I was more worried about assassination by Raidos’s hand if anything.</p>
<p>「Fran-dono, don’t push yourself too hard, okay? I can get back to town.」</p>
<p>「I know.」</p>
<p>He’s nodding now, but I’m sure he’ll be reckless in times of need. Besides, as I’ve seen from our fight in the Kranzel Kingdom, Fran is not very good at defense.</p>
<p>That’s because everyone around us was protecting them, so she couldn’t bring herself to say it seriously. Fran seemed to feel the same way, jumping out of the Adventurer’s Guild to tell her thoughts.</p>
<p>(Master)</p>
<p>『What’s wrong?』</p>
<p>(I’ll crush those guys from Raydoss before they come to Barbra.)</p>
<p>『You mean to say you’re going to leave while you’re still fighting?』</p>
<p>It may sound reckless, but Fran’s strength would be utilized in rescuing the surprise attack in a large place. And above all, we could let Raydoss get one shot.</p>
<p>(We’ll be ahead of him this time.)</p>
<p>『Yeah... Alright! I’ll do it then!』</p>
