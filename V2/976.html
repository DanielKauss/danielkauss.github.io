</div><h1>Chapter 976</h1><p>At the price of depriving her of her giant-type right leg, the tree fell to the ground looking run out of energy and power. However, no one tried to save her. Even the guard, Mr. Ragnarok, refused to move. He was just standing next to the raging breath of the tree, trying to protect it. A hydrangea then approached the tree. He jumped off the carriage with a light body and approached the treetop. She jumped off the carriage with a light body and approached the treetop. In its hand, it was holding a jet-black sheath.  It was probably Berserk’s sheath.  The tree, which was still at its knees, lifted Berserk with a trembling hand and held it horizontally in front of it.  On the other hand, the hydrangea held the sheath in her hands and slowly put Berserk in it. After a few seconds, Berserk was completely slashed by the slash.  Then the Saserk immediately moved and picked up the Pine Snow. Perhaps there was some reason why they couldn’t touch it when Berserk was pulled out. Perhaps it was because he had lost consciousness, but he didn’t move tightly in the arms of the dragonkin.  That exhaustion even without being released.  Well, it was understandable that he would die if he got serious.  </p>
<p>(Master.  Beat the giants.)</p>
<p>『You’re right.』</p>
<p>  The super giant-type had achieved a tremendous increase in power by the fusion of the giant-types. However, he fell to the ground after losing one of his legs.  </p>
<p>『It doesn’t regenerate after all.  Is that Berserk’s ability? Anyway, this is the right time for us!』</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
<p> This was our greatest chance now that we were struggling to get up. Everyone must have understood that. You gathered the soldiers together again, and the adventurers went to support them.  </p>
<p>「Take five minutes!」</p>
<p>「Got it!」</p>
<p> Isario didn’t seem to be releasing his Divine Sword Release, but rather was unleashing powerful attacks by taking longer to accumulate them.  Neither Fran nor I wanted him to release his Divine Sword Release. That’s not something we use Divine Swords that often.  The backlash and exhaustion alone are a tremendous burden. Now I could see how surprising it was for me that Ashwrath had freed us from the Divine Sword’s power in the Beast Kingdom. It took Isario a rather long pause, but I guess that’s just how strong his super giant-type was. </p>
<p>『Fran...  I’ll crush your remaining left leg!』</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
<p>『Urushi, you’re gonna attack him with your Bottomless Shadow.  Even if things don’t go smoothly, you can just interfere with his stomping』</p>
<p>(Woof!)</p>
<p> The Bottomless Shadow is a technique that swallows the opponent into the open space of shadow on the ground and disappears. However, the speed at which it swallows was slow, and if the enemy’s entire body can’t be swallowed, it won’t be fully activated and escaped.  It would be impossible to swallow this huge body first. However, the shadow that was activated will be like a bottomless swamp, so it would be less resilient than a normal ground.  </p>
<p>「Urushi, do your best」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  Fran and I were aiming for the ankle of a giant human. The moment he put enough force into it to get up, we slammed into it with a series of thunder spells.  </p>
<p>「Haaa!  Brilliant Lightning Rush!  Kanna Kamui!」</p>
<p>『Kanna Kamui!』</p>
<p>  Four Kanna Kamui shots in total, Fran and I, shattered the ankles of the giant-type. The super giant-type, which was about to move to a bridge state to get up, lost its support and struck the ground again.  </p>
<p>『Fran!  Attack!  It’s a follow up attack!  It will further damage its legs before it is regenerated!』</p>
<p>「Nn!  Haaaaah!」</p>
<p>  Fran, who had run through the sky and was approaching the ankle of the giant, activated her sword technique with all her might. It was not a Heavenly Judgment that required a lot of power, but a Holy Sword Art that she could immediately use.  </p>
<p>「Brade Rondo!」</p>
<p>  The Blade Rondo, the level 8 Sword Saint Technique.  Well, what was important was a series of ultra-high-speed slashes. In three seconds, about twelve slashes were unleashed incessantly, causing major wounds on the knees of the giant.  Originally, this technique was used to attack multiple enemies, but Fran concentrated her attacks on a single point. The current Fran was quite proficient in even the highest-level Sword Saint Techniques. However, the giant-type was not just being defeated. </p>
<p>「Hmm?」</p>
<p>『Ahhh!』</p>
<p>  She unleashed a magic bullet at Fran, who was taking aback after the move.  I’m glad she had prepared for teleportation. As I thought, she was not the type to be underestimated.  The regeneration of her knees has already begun, but it will take her tens of seconds to fully recover.  It will take her even longer to get up from there.  </p>
<p>(Master, next is her arm!)</p>
<p>『Okay!』</p>
<p>  Urushi attacked her left arm with his Bottomless Shadow. It seemed that he didn’t like the feeling of sinking and couldn’t pull it off.  </p>
<p>『What we’re aiming for is her right arm!』</p>
<p>「Nn! Haaa!」</p>
<p>「Brrroogh!」</p>
<p>  I slashed at her right arm, which remained with the Sheaths of Wind technique, and then activated a series of Thunder Magic attacks. The purpose was to hinder her movements and make her unable to use it to wake up.  I heard a roar from the giant-type, which they hated.  Perhaps in a situation where things were not going well, the giant-type ignored us and tried to thrust its arms forward in an attempt to get up. But I was waiting for this.  </p>
<p>『Here!』</p>
<p>  It aimed for the moment when it thrust its arm into the ground and struck with its full force telekinesis. The giant-type elbows, which were applied invisible power as if they were going to be ducked from the inside, bent.  </p>
<p>「Buoooh?」</p>
<p>  The giant-type was lying on the ground again, with an expression that said he didn’t know why its elbows bent on their own. The impact of the body slammed against it caused a series of swings to run around it. Due to the multiple occurrences of the giant-type and its repeated collapse, the ground beneath its body had collapsed.  </p>
<p>「I’ll knees again!」</p>
<p>『Ou!』</p>
<p> As Fran and I continued to strike the giant-type limbs, I heard Isario’s cries echo through the air.  </p>
<p>「Sorry to keep you waiting!  Retreat!」</p>
<p>  At the same time, a pillar of flames rang up from the place where Isario stood.  It was between the giant-type and the city. They must have been careful to avoid causing any damage as much as possible. It was just right after Fran and Urushi moved away at their maximum speed without looking back.  </p>
<p>「Haaaah! Ash!」</p>
<p>  Isario shot a huge sphere of fire.  A bright red ball of fire ran through the air melting the earth like candy. And a direct hit the torso of the giant-type, creating a crimson dome that swallowed its upper body.  </p>
<p>「Brrrrrr!」</p>
<p> From inside the huge dome, which was more than 100 meters in diameter, we heard a pitiful scream from the giant.  Strangely enough, we didn’t sense that much heat. It seems that flames and heat were trapped inside the dome.  And to prove it, the earth bordering the dome only turned a little red like that. Isario must have chosen to attack with as little damage to the surrounding area as possible.  Dozens of seconds later, the flame dome began to contract, and after a minute, it completely disappeared.  And the upper half of the giant’s body had no signs of life. It must have turned into ashes and disappeared.  Some of the remaining lower half of its body and arms crumbled and disappeared. No matter how tremendous its regenerative power was, it seemed that if its upper half was erased, it wouldn’t be able to revive.  </p>
<p>「Phew...  Striker......」</p>
<p>  Isario cowered on the spot after watching the victory. He managed to avoid falling down on Ignis, but I could see obvious fatigue and weary on his face.  He seemed to be wearing more than the slashes he had defeated the giant-type before. Even so, this was better than the Divine Sword Release.  Unlike this time, which only consumed some of his physical and magical power, the Divine Sword Release was far more fundamental to it. Even I, who is not a Divine Sword, understood that.  </p>
<p>「Isario!  Are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Ou, I managed to do something about it...It seemed to be more exhausting than the slashes that defeated the giant-type earlier. Even so, this was probably better than the Divine Sword Release. Unlike this time, which only consumed some of my strength and magic power, the Divine Sword Release was much more fundamental to it. Even I, who is not a Divine Sword, understood that. </p>
<p>「Isario! Are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Ou, I managed to do something about it... But I just want to take a break」</p>
