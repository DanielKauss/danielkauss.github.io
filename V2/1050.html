</div><h1>Chapter 1050</h1><p>Fran was fighting a military-fitting girl named Marl, but her attack had been slowed down by the sight of her opponent wearing a slave collar. The fact that she was a slave girl must stimulate Fran’s trauma. Even an opponent that could normally be defeated can not be defeated without an attack. </p>
<p>『She’s coming!』</p>
<p> The girl used her ice foothold and wind magic to run around the sky, unleashing her ice and snow magic at a distance so close that she could get herself caught in it. The girl used her ice foothold and wind magic to run around the sky, unleashing her ice and snow magic at a distance that would include herself.  </p>
<p>「Diamond Dust!」</p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>『That’s quite powerful!』</p>
<p>  Fran frowned as the cold air blew her away.  Her magic power must have been enhanced by being a magician. The girl continued to cast magic in rapid succession.  By using split thinking, she continued to cast multiple spells with a time lag. Physical people shouldn’t be able to withstand the intense pain, but... Because she was being controlled, she seemed to be moving ignoring the pain.  And that’s not all.  </p>
<p>「The white smoke」</p>
<p>『This is...!』</p>
<p>  It seemed that the goal of the series of Diamond Dust attacks was to fill the surrounding area with cold air. The white cold air restricted their vision, and it was clear to me that the power of ice and snow magic had increased.  </p>
<p>『Fran! At this rate, it’ll just be a waste of time!』</p>
<p>(Nn...)</p>
<p>『If you can’t kill them, stop moving. I’ll just break their limbs and disable them!』</p>
<p>(... Okay)</p>
<p>  Seeing the burning town reminded her that she didn’t have time.  Fran held me up with a miserable expression. It’s best to just make her paralyze, but Marl has a resistance to abnormal conditions.  </p>
<p>「Teyaaa!」</p>
<p>『I don’t have a grudge, but I’ll have you calm down!』</p>
<p>  Fran pushed her barrier to its full strength and rushed forward, repelling her ice and snow magic. Even when she saw Fran jump out of the white cold air that stood in her way, Marl did not move at all.  He pulled out the saber at his waist with a motion that did not stop, and tried to catch the slash.  However, there was no way we would lose if we approached this distance.  Fran flicked off Marl’s saber with her left back fist. Then she slashed up her open right arm, and slashed off her left leg in an arcuating trajectory without killing the momentum that had raised her sword.  She didn’t seem to be feeling any pain, but it seemed that she had lost her balance. She was trying to regain her balance by stopping her movements.  Fran kicked directly above Marl and slammed it off toward the ship below us. It was his vicious left leg, imbued with Divine Attributes.  Marl’s body slammed into the mast with tremendous force and broke through the ground. However, it seemed that his momentum had been killed, and he had been slammed out without breaking through the deck.  He didn’t move, but was he unconscious?  </p>
<p>『Alright, let’s restrain him just like this! I hope that the slave collar can be overwritten by my contract magic...』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  I saw a crew member running toward Marl, and they used magic to check him. However, the crew members still did not run away and were trying to get closer to him somehow.  </p>
<p>「 princess!」</p>
<p>「Save the princess!」</p>
<p>  They call Marl the princess.  On the broken mast was an eight-headed snake-like emblem. Apparently, the small ship that was used to replace the damage was boarded by people from the Sea of Seedran. In other words, people from Seedran were probably just going to use it as a single-use magician from the beginning.  Fran’s face contorted, perhaps understanding that. She seemed to be sickened by the way Raydoss Kingdom acted. After blowing the crew members away with magic, Fran landed on the deck and rushed to Marl.  </p>
<p>「Shit...  Princess-sama...」</p>
<p>「I won’t let Marl Princess-sama do it...!」</p>
<p>  The crew members were still worried about their princess, even as she collapsed on the deck. I bet she was the only one who could have been uncontrollable. If they had not met her differently, could they have become friends with Fran?  </p>
<p>「Master, collar――」</p>
<p>『Get away from here, Fran!』</p>
<p>  As soon as she tried to restrain and release the collar, a huge amount of ice-attributed magic power was released from Marl. It instantly covered its deck and overflowed further into the surrounding area. The surface of the sea then froze, and the crew members who were worried about Marl had turned into ice statues.  </p>
<p>「Guh, Ghuh...  Gaaaaaaah!」</p>
<p>『Regeneration? No, did you make the limbs that you’ve lost from the ice?』</p>
<p>  Marl stood up with a high-pitched roar. His face had changed from a expressionless expression to a stern expression like a threatening beast.  His body could be seen large not only because of his intimidation but also because he had covered Marl’s body with ice, forming a white ogre. It seemed that his lost arms and legs were also made up for by the ice. He stood up without seeming to be bothered. </p>
<p>「Uuuoooourgh!」</p>
<p>  It was the size of a large cruiser on Earth!  Moreover, its effect was wider than before.  Although it was small, it was not as big as that of other ships. In terms of size, it was about the size of a large cruiser on Earth.  The cold air released by Marl swallowed such a ship in an instant and frozen the entire ship in white. They were probably no longer thinking about their comrades. Marl’s eyes were focused only on Fran.  I couldn’t help but notice the changed appearance of the crew members who were worried about her. But maybe that’s better for Marl.  </p>
<p>「Wooof!」</p>
<p>「Teyaaa!」</p>
<p>  He dodged Marl’s blow as he struck, and Fran cut off his arm. Its strength was quite high due to its magical power, and my durability value had been considerably reduced.  Even so, it was not enough to repel Fran’s slash.  The tip of his right elbow was repelled and flew through the air. However, Marl had completely quit being a human being.  </p>
<p>「... It began to grow」</p>
<p>『The feeling now, I’m pretty sure you’ve sliced through its main body.There’s no time for us to slow down when we get back from Gordicia!</p>
