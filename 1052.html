</div><h1>Chapter 1052</h1><p>With her back to Marl, Fran ran across the skies above the enemy fleet.</p>
<p>Then he was able to guide Marl in an interesting way. He was chasing after Fran and lunging in a straight line. Perhaps it was thanks to his increased magic power, Marl was flying in the sky with only his wind magic.</p>
<p>Fran and Urushi head for the water dragonkin without showing any signs of stopping.</p>
<p>As we were about to jump on the water dragonkin, a layer of light stopped Fran’s rush.</p>
<p>「Heb!」</p>
<p>『A ward huh!? You’re discriminating against our enemies after all!』</p>
<p>Fran had a weird look on her face. She also seemed to block our teleportation and couldn’t get past her.</p>
<p>However, it didn’t seem to have the ability to counterattack, and Fran was standing on top of the barrier. Attacks could come from each ship, but they were only able to be repelled by my barrier.</p>
<p>『Well then, I wonder about Marl?』</p>
<p>「Gugaaaa!」</p>
<p>「Got it!」</p>
<p>Fran evaded Marle’s attack and landed a direct hit on the deck of the water dragonkin, creating a large hole. The wards and the damage transfer were not working.</p>
<p>As we had hoped, this time we would no longer be able to ignore Marl and take over the water dragonkin.</p>
<p>『All right, let’s just sink them from the surrounding ships!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>In contrast to our happy faces, the enemy crew members were still watching.</p>
<p>「Stop that! What are you alchemists doing!」</p>
<p>「That’s why we shouldn’t rely on the power of the lunatics in the east!」</p>
<p>「Oh, Princess Mar... What a painful sight.」</p>
<p>「Crap, Princess-sama! Let’s take care of these guys from Raydoss!」</p>
<p>I can hear all kinds of screams. The ones who are angry are from the Raidos Kingdom, and those who are friendly to Marl are probably from the Sea Kingdom of Sydran.</p>
<p>Fran escaped through the barrier to the scaffolding and guided Marle’s attacks toward the large ships of the Water Dragonkin and the surrounding Raidos Kingdom.</p>
<p>A ship opened a large hole in the hull after being hit by ice bombardment. A ship freezes, and cracks are beginning to appear in the hull. A ship’s crew was frozen due to the wide range of cold air. And the damage from that ship was increasing at a tremendous pace over time.</p>
<p>Like I thought, Marl’s attacks seemed to get through the enemy’s barrier, and the water dragonkin and the surrounding ships were never able to block it.</p>
<p>Some of Seedrun’s ships began to attack the Raidos Kingdom on this ship. They didn’t seem to be carrying any bows and arrows, and to my surprise, they struck the hull of that ship.</p>
<p>As the chaos continued to spread, something strange began to occur in Marl.</p>
<p>「Gugah, Gah, Aaaaaaahhhh!」</p>
<p>「Something’s getting bigger?」</p>
<p>『That’s not a mistake. It’s sucking the sea water and increasing the volume of its body』</p>
<p>Marl had begun to grow huge. Originally, a small girl would be about five meters high. It looked strange as if a girl’s face was on the body of a giant demon.</p>
<p>At first glance, the body seemed to boast muscular mana, but I didn’t think it had any muscles inside. It seemed that its body, which was made of ice, was more like a being whose ice magic power was compressed and formed.</p>
<p>At the same time, its magic power increased tremendously.</p>
<p>It seems that the magic power that he couldn’t hold back in his body was leaking out around him as intense cold air.</p>
<p>He had already turned into a figure that could freeze his surroundings just by being there without needing to do anything. It was as if he was constantly firing at me a hint of ice and snow magic stone dust.</p>
<p>「Gyaaaaah! My arm!」</p>
<p>「Y-yes―」</p>
<p>「Hey, Princess. I’m coming first.」</p>
<p>「Grandfather of the Sea!」</p>
<p>The damage was far beyond our expectations, spreading not only to the ships of the Raidos Kingdom but also to the ships of the Sea Kingdom of Sydran.</p>
<p>About ten minutes later.</p>
<p>The combined fleet of Raydoss Kingdom and Seedrun Sea Kingdom was completely worth a visit.</p>
<p>About 30% of the ships had sunk, and almost no ships were still safe. Half of the remaining ships had large holes drilled out, and they were trapped in the frozen sea surface and unable to move.</p>
<p>Even if we leave now, more than half of them will probably be gone.</p>
<p>The water dragonkin was still alive and sound. Before I knew it, the damage to its hull had been repaired. It was not first aid, but the wounds had disappeared cleanly.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, our swords and armor were in a world where magic and skills can instantly fix them. It wouldn’t be surprising if they had skills like hull carpenter or ship-repair.</p>
<p>It should have taken a lot of magic power, but I guess we could split that up from the water dragons.</p>
<p>『That ship is even more troublesome than I had imagined!』</p>
<p>(What do we do?)</p>
<p>『...Fran, you already know that, don’t you?』</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>There was still another big threat.2 One of them, the water dragonkin, was still guarded by the barrier. Moreover, since it could repair itself, it would be necessary to attack it in an instant to make it disappear.</p>
<p>It would be difficult to unleash such an attack in a situation where Maar was continuously on a rampage. Well, there’s nothing I couldn’t do, but...</p>
<p>If we had been able to neutralize our enemy fleet up to this point, we would want to get on board the water dragonkin and take them down. Having an enemy top brass would give us a lot of information too.</p>
<p>『But first, we have to take down Marl.』</p>
<p>「......Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran understood that too. She must have purposely decided not to think about it. The trauma bound Fran’s heart more than she had imagined.</p>
<p>She had even used a detour method of killing each other using Marr to force her way through time. This was the first time that Fran, who was always serious about the battle, had fought a battle that was even called a mock battle in front of a strong enemy.</p>
<p>But it was already difficult for her to keep ignoring Marl.</p>
<p>Marle immediately followed Fran as she jumped up into the sky. The tag fight was almost over.</p>
<p>「...I’ll do it.」</p>
<p>『I can do it, you know?』</p>
<p>There was no need for Fran to directly handle it. But Fran shook her head.</p>
<p>「Don’t worry. Let me do it」</p>
<p>Fran stared at Marl with her straight eyes, but her feelings seemed to still be shaken. Was she really okay?</p>
<p>However, as if to put a damper on Fran’s resolve, there was more to come for Marl.</p>
<p>「Grrrrr!」</p>
<p>Suddenly, my body twitched and began to suffer. The wind magic that was lifting my body was disturbed, and my body tilted.</p>
<p>Then, words other than “Howl” leaked out of his mouth.</p>
<p>「Aah... Everyone is dead――」</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>『My reason is... back?』</p>
<p>Her eyes, which had been dominated by madness and wildness just a moment ago, had certainly returned to the color of reason.</p>
<p>Those were the eyes that made me feel human emotions.</p>
<p>But what leaked out of his mouth were words that were not rational. A mutter of lament, filled with mad despair.</p>
<p>It seems that she remembered something from when she went out of control.</p>
<p>From her face, the signs of her complete outburst had disappeared, and she looked like a sad girl. Tears overflowed from both eyes, frozen from the corners and crumbled away.</p>
<p>She also seemed to remember that she had killed a person from the Sea Kingdom of Sydran with her own hands.</p>
<p>At the same time, the vicious cold energy overflowing from Marl weakened in surprise. It was probably not because her power was weakened, but because she was under proper control.</p>
<p>The girl’s weak eyes then turned to Fran.</p>
<p>「...Is this a hell...?」</p>
