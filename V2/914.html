</div><h1>Chapter 914</h1><p>「Velmeria has right, and Lind has left.」</p>
<p>「Leave it to me!」</p>
<p>「Quo!」</p>
<p> Fran and the others split into three groups and attacked the giant cannon-type. A closer look revealed that the turtle’s shell had a spider-like leg attached to it. This was not the same as the normal cannon-type, but it had unfamiliar parts on the edge of its shell. It was a long tentacle with four long tentacles with tips that swelled like a weight. There were a total of eight of them, four on the left and four on the right. As Fran approached the tentacles, magic bullets were released from those tentacles. They must be like interceptors that protect the surroundings of the giant body that easily formed a blind spot.  Fran slashed at the huge body while dodging its attack.  It was a slash that was enhanced by speed and magic power, but not enough to be defeated by a single blow. As I could imagine from the huge body, its defense and life force were very high.  </p>
<p>「Brilliant Lightning Rush!  Haaa!」</p>
<p>『Fire!』</p>
<p>  Fran clad in black lightning and thrust me at the wound of the cannon-type. </p>
<p>「Giiiiiiiii!」</p>
<p>  As expected from a giant antidemon, it was hard to find any before this attack.  The huge body then fell to the ground with smoke rising from all over its body.  We were on guard for a few moments, but we saw the cannon-type beginning to change to dust.  </p>
<p>『All right, next!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  Fran killed up to five of them in the same way.  But that’s far enough.  The enemy’s shots began earlier than we had expected. Velmeria and Lind couldn’t cut down the number of them, allowing the bombardment to begin.  </p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Gyuooooh!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>  A flash erupted from the turret on his back, triggered by a high-pitched roar similar to a scream. It was a mass of magical power nearly ten meters in diameter. The amount of magic power contained in it was extraordinary.  The giant cannon-type was unusually powerful, but they also showed signs of unusual behavior.  What a turn of events, when I thought about it collapsing, it turned into dust.  It seemed to be a single-use antidemon. This was possible because the concept of being an individual was weak and antidemons prioritized maintaining the group.  It was a blow from a huge antidemon with powerful power that sacrificed even his own life. There was no way they could be weak.  Twenty magic bullets with tremblingly vicious magical power flew through the air as if they were a tall mountain parabolic. The distance between them was probably seven or eight hundred meters, but the trajectory of the magic bullet seemed to have accurately caught the wall.  Half of them was shot down by the magic that we and Mea had unleashed on the spur of the moment, but ten of them rained down on the wall. Boooom!  Magic was released all at once, and a flash of light then covered the wall. When the intense light and smoke cleared, the ruinous appearance of the wall was exposed.  The wall was destroyed over nearly 300 meters.  Some of it managed to stand like an apple’s core after it had been devoured.  However, a small amount of attack would easily collapse the wall. Moreover, the buildings around the wall were blown away by the aftermath of the magic projectile.  The huge space that was created in an instant was difficult to defend and easy to attack. This was a danger not only to us but also to Sendia as a whole.  </p>
<p>「Yes, I did.」</p>
<p>  Fran grunted in frustration. Nearby, I heard Velmeria muttering in a stunned manner.  </p>
<p>「Fre, Derick......」</p>
<p>Yes, her follower, Frederick, was on the wall!  The place where Frederick had stood to take command of the dragonkin had been completely destroyed and turned into a pile of rubble.  If that bombardment had landed a direct hit, I should have Frederick―― no, he should be fine.  I could see a dragonkin man standing up after pushing the rubble away. I’m sure some of them were still alive by using our life detection.  We may be able to save them. If we go now, we could save their lives.  But that doesn’t mean we could leave.  </p>
<p>『Fran!  The antidemons have changed their movements!』</p>
<p> It seems the antidemons are starting to make their way out of here.  Until now, they had been in a one-point formation. However, the collapse of the wall seems to have shifted their strategy toward expanding into a town.  Once the city was expanded over a wide area, it would be difficult to prevent it with a small number of antidemons. In fact, it would be impossible to prevent the antidemons from entering completely.  Fran seemed to understand that as well. She muttered a single word with a stern expression.  </p>
<p>「Let’s reduce it as much as possible.」</p>
<p>『Okay. I’m sorry for holding back.』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  Fran nodded and took off while holding me up. It wasn’t any kind of conservation or succession.  We just had to do something about it.  </p>
<p>「Brilliant Lightning Rush!  Haaaah!」</p>
<p>  The target is high-ranking antidemons.  A low-ranking one may be able to deal with them by soldiers and adventurers in the town. Then, we should defeat the antidemons with individual strength. Ten minutes have passed since we started fighting.  Since they were constantly fighting with increasing their speed with Space-Time Magic, I felt a tremendous sense of time. They were exhausted and even gave off the illusion that they were fighting for hours. Even so, Fran continued to fight on top gear.  </p>
<p>「Uraaaa!」</p>
<p>「Grrrr!」</p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>  Fran, clad in black lightning, slashed at the red wolf-type antidemons with a scream. At the same time, she was hit by the wide range attacks that the black wolf-types had unleashed around her.  She had used a high-ranking species as bait.  We succeeded in blocking it with a barrier, but her magic power was greatly reduced.  Fran, who had gone all out, didn’t have to take any serious damage. However, it was difficult to deal much damage just by exhausting her magic power. The antidemons, perhaps realizing that we were fighting with a smaller amount of magic power, have switched to a strategy that requires as much magic power as possible. However, they couldn’t ask for help from their friends. Mea and Zelos Reed already used their strongest move to fight with as much power as they could.  </p>
<p>「Golden flames!  A white fire!  Devour your enemies!」</p>
<p>  platinum flames overflowed from Mea’s entire body. The huge platinum flames that had covered the girl’s body became a muddy stream, engulfing the antidemons in the area.  </p>
<p>「More and more!」</p>
<p>  The swirling flames became more and more violent.  It was as if she was looking for prey. The swirling flames nearly 50 meters in diameter turned over a thousand antidemons into ashes in a fraction of a second.  That must be Mea’s strongest move. That was certainly amazing, but it was an attack that required a price to pay.  </p>
<p>「Kuh......!」</p>
<p>  I heard Mea’s murderous screams.  What happened?  The answer to my question came when the flames weakened. To my surprise, Mea’s arm had turned reddish-black as it appeared from the fire.  It had been badly burned.  Just as Black Heavenly Tigers had Thunder Nullification, Mea, the Golden Flame Lion, must have the Fire Nullification skill. She didn’t take any damage from her own fire.  Still, the fact that she was burned meant that Mea’s platinum flames even exceeded her flame nullification skills. In other words, she was plunged into the realm of divine flames.  The reason why the regeneration of the burns was clearly slow was probably that it contained a slight divine attribute. If she had misunderstood the flames, she would have perished in no time at all. Even though it was so dangerous, Mea was still more motivated to fight.  She glared at the antidemons with her glowing eyes as she defeated the antidemons who were trying to climb over the wall. A lion clad in flames was using his body as a shield to protect Sendia.  Lind was fighting antidemons at a distance from Mea. Even the fire dragon Lind would be damaged by Mea’s platinum flames. He would use his huge body as a wall to interfere with the antidemons and try to reduce their invasion as much as possible.  Zefmate and Frederick were in the same condition.  They tried to hold back the antidemons by putting up potions to heal their wounds, big and small.  Velmeria and Frederick had created a wall of water more than 100 meters long, trying to somehow block their way into the antidemon town. It seemed to have the ability to automatically counterattack antidemons that touched the water wall, and hundreds of antidemons had been slaughtered there.  While maintaining that level of water magic, they even went on the offensive.  They held a dagger created with water in their hands and flew among the antidemons. Each time Velmeria whirled around, the antidemons leapt to a pulp.  In addition, I saw a surge of magic power in Velmeria’s head.  No, it wasn’t so much her head, but her mouth?  As I was wondering, a white flash erupted from Velmeria’s mouth.  </p>
<p>「Uraaaaaaaaaah!」</p>
<p>(Amazing, just like a dragon.)</p>
<p>  The flow of magic was very similar to the dragonkin’s brace attack we had seen before.  I never thought she could do something like this.  Velmeria’s brace, which was released horizontally, was involved more than a thousand antidemons in one shot.  But I couldn’t help but be impressed. I could see the magic in Velmeria’s body rapidly dwindling. Even though she had inherited some of the power of the Divine Dragon Form, she must have pushed herself too hard.  It was the same for everyone else.  </p>
<p>『Crap......!』</p>
<p>However, when someone ran out of magic power, it would start a imbalance.However, when someone ran out of magic power, it would start a imbalance. The sound of the tragic footsteps could be heard right next to our ears.</p>
