</div><h1>Chapter 916</h1><p>They were wounded to the bone. Fran and Urushi’s condition was just that. </p>
<p>「Uraaaaaaaaahhh!」</p>
<p> The pain and fatigue twisted with great force, and Fran swung me. </p>
<p>「Gisshiaaaah!」</p>
<p>「Aahhhh...... Tyaaah!」</p>
<p> The antidemons continued to attack us without even having time to breathe. They were so raging that it made me wonder if they had any problems with their throats or lungs, or if they were caught in the cold. I wanted to suggest an escape anymore, but Fran couldn’t escape from here. I wanted to suggest an escape, but Fran couldn’t escape from here.  </p>
<p>「Deryaaaaaaah! Burn!」</p>
<p>「Water Dragon Impact!」</p>
<p> Near Fran, her friends Mea and Velmeria continued to fight in the same pain.  Her white hair and skin were red from her own blood, and Mea was in great pain. Velmeria’s scales and claws had been peeling, and her blood had splatters on each swing of her arms. Zefmate’s entire body was still covered with wounds, and Lind and Frede had lost one of their wings. There was no way Fran could leave those people behind and run away by herself.  </p>
<p>(Master! Together!)</p>
<p>『Yeah!』</p>
<p> Fran slashed at the antidemons that move quickly, and I used my magic to defeat the antidemons that came to chase after her.  Even so, this was not enough to prevent the attacks of the quick antidemons. They were already surrounded by the jet-black-type, making it difficult for them.  </p>
<p>「Ghuh!」</p>
<p>「Ugh!」</p>
<p>  The wolf-type was on Fran’s right arm. It held on without letting go of me somehow, but the antidemons didn’t miss this chance. They jumped from all directions.  Fran clenched the antidemons’ throats in her left hand and freed her right arm, but we were not fast enough to intercept them. I felt this and activated my magic as soon as I could.  </p>
<p>『Bwah!』</p>
<p>  The Gale Hazard, which was activated in sync, created a wind wall around us. However, there were still antidemons who protected themselves with their magic armor and withstood the strong winds.  There were three red wolf-types.  They bit Fran’s shoulders, both legs with large mouths. However, Fran did not let out a grunt.  Rather, she immediately attacked the wolf-type. The crimson-type was the higher tier of the jet-black type.  If we could defeat the three of them here, the antidemons would surely suffer a lot.  That was why Fran thought that she could withstand the blow with her magic power and bit it into herself. So, she was planning to limit our opponent’s evasion power and counter them.  She must have made that decision in the face of the three approaching antidemons and decided instantly. Her movements were almost at the same time as when she was bitten. </p>
<p>「Raaaaah!」</p>
<p>『Let Fran get away from here!』</p>
<p>  Fran manipulated the black lightning all over her body and concentrated on one that was biting her right leg. I pulled them off and passed magic power through the strings wrapped around her neck. By dropping its head, it could defeat even the crimson-type.  And then I thrust me into the last one that bit into its shoulder to pierce its end. The wolf-type showed some evasive movement, but Fran’s attacks were quicker for just a moment. Even the speed-specialized beast-type antidemons could not avoid them in time for the moment they attacked.  Fran’s throwaway strategy had wiped out three of the most troublesome red wolf enemies in the enemy.  It was the result of a war, but there was no smile on Fran’s face. </p>
<p>「Ghuh......」</p>
<p>『Poison!』</p>
<p>  I even used poison on a wolf’s habit!  I instantly healed him with antidote, but I could tell.  Fran was the limit. Originally, it was the limit, but now the magic poison for a moment was over.  The antidemons mercilessly rushed toward Fran, who was still on her defensive stance.  </p>
<p>『Fran! It’s already too late!』</p>
<p>(...... Don’t run away!)</p>
<p>『AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!』</p>
<p>  I used magic to intercept the antidemons, but when I ran out of magic power, the real deal was over. At this point, we’ll have no choice but to force them to escape by teleporting.  Mea and the others will retreat to the city together and somehow rebuild the front. I don’t know if I really can rebuild it, but it’s better than dying here. Just when I was wondering where to activate the Dimension Gate.  </p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p> Fran looked at her feet with a strange look on her face.  At that moment, the earth shone a golden glow.  A huge amount of magic power blew around us.  With that power, the antidemons had stopped moving. It seemed to be the same principle that Sophie had attracted the antidemons’ attention with the sound of her mana applied. She suddenly stopped moving because she didn’t know how to react to the magical power that enveloped her. For a moment, I thought Ashwrath had arrived, but that wasn’t it.  The mana filling the battlefield was so gentle that it couldn’t be helped by that demonkin’s mana. Both Fran and I remembered that magic.  </p>
<p>(Sophie, welcome back......)</p>
<p>  We had been waiting for the saintess’s return.  There was indeed a hint of Sophie on the other side of the collapsed wall. And it wasn’t just her.  I could sense the presence of thousands of people following behind her.  Wasn’t that just a bit strange? There were too many people, so it felt as if――.  Before my doubts took form, Fran muttered a powerful mutter. There was no hint of weakness in her voice. </p>
<p>「It’s coming.」</p>
<p>『Me too!』</p>
<p> The lost strength and magic that Fran’s wounds had begun to recover was slowly returning.  The music that echoed on the battlefield gave us strength.  It was a combination of sounds, like an orchestra, a music that could not be played very solo. Maybe the orchestra found Sophie in person?  But still, this song......  I could hear the song just like Sophie’s.  It wasn’t Sophie’s song. Hundreds or thousands of people were singing it all at once.  </p>
<p>「I know this song.」</p>
<p>『The song the adventurers were singing at the bar...』</p>
<p>  It was a cheerful and cheerful song.  </p>
<p>「We are adventurers~... ♪ The golden adventurers~... ♪」</p>
<p>「No foe shall make us falter!」</p>
<p>「Dragons, demons, bring anything on!」</p>
<p>「The hordes of antidemons will be a piece of cake!」</p>
<p>  It was not as simple and clean as one might imagine when you hear the choir’s voice.  It was a cacophony of unspoken songs that each sang their own way.  I couldn’t say they were good or beautiful. But that was exactly why they were so focused on their thoughts. Thousands of voices echoed through the sky. Strangely enough, when I was listening to them, my strength welled up. </p>
<p>「You are rooting for me.」</p>
<p>『Yeah. You’re right』</p>
<p>  It was not just music. This was a song to cheer Fran and Urushi.  </p>
<p>「Good luck, don’t lose!」</p>
<p>「We’ll fight together.」</p>
<p>  That was the feeling I had when I heard it.  I understood it the moment I heard it.  Your wounds healed, your strength returned, and your magic power was restored. But more importantly, the fact that it wasn’t just me seemed to have brought Fran and Urushi back to life.  </p>
<p>「Fran! I’ve brought reinforcements with me!」</p>
<p>「Sophie!」</p>
