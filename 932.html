</div><h1>Chapter 932</h1><p>Three days after Fran woke up, we arrived in front of the wall that had been destroyed by the bombardment. The residents had set up some simple fences and other stuff, and the repairs had already begun. However, it was impossible to easily fix the wall, which had been destroyed over a wide area, and it was expected to take several months to complete. We fended off the previous attack, but we don’t know what will happen next. It was currently the antidemon season. That was where Fran came in. </p>
<p>「Here I go!」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>  The beastman guiding us was about ten meters before the wall was under repair. He had set up a long rope to make it easier for us to understand.  Fran stood in front of him and started chanting. She could also use chanting without requiring any chanting, but it required less magic power to chant.  </p>
<p>「―― Great Wall」</p>
<p>「Ooorgh! T-This is...  amazing!」</p>
<p> We built a huge earth wall. We were asked to build a simple wall with earth magic just in time for the complete restoration of the city wall.  We used Great Wall in succession to create a long, high wall in front of the collapsed area. There was a small gap between the city wall and the earth wall at both ends, but the beastmen were said to transport the earth and bury it here.  It would be pointless for high-ranking antidemons, but it wouldn’t be a problem for them to prevent the invasion of low-ranking antidemons. They should destroy the wall once the main body is repaired, so it would be a good first aid.  In addition, more than 2,000 reinforcements from Nocta, the northern, and western ports had arrived. As long as they don’t get attacked by tens of thousands of antidemons, Sendia’s defense will be fine.  </p>
<p>「As expected of Black Lightning Princess! Thank you very much!」</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Thank you very much!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p> The beastmen had completely become their underlings, wasn’t they?  Mea was their boss, and Fran was their maiden. Besides, the beastmen were not the only ones who could bow their heads.  </p>
<p>「Hmm?  Swordsman from the Black Cat kin! Hello!」</p>
<p>「Black Lightning Princess-dono, you’ve gonna have a hard time」</p>
<p>「Aah, Black Cat Onee-chan!」</p>
<p>  They were the citizens, adventurers, and outlaws who had fought with them.  All of them were proud to see Fran and her friends wipe out the antidemons at risk of their lives. They were also proud to have helped them. As a result, they were very popular everywhere as heroes who saved this city with them.As a result, Fran became very popular everywhere as a hero who saved this city together with her.  I once saw the children fighting for Fran and her party before they played the role of hero.  In the shortage of supplies, the old man gave them food, and some adults even stroked their heads. Fran was particularly young and smaller in the group, which seemed to be why she was even cuter than the others.  However, that was not the case for everyone.  </p>
<p>「Oi!」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>「You’re the Black Lightning Princess!  You can’t beat me!」</p>
<p>「I failed to hold back a little」</p>
<p> The most common ones were idiots who wanted to defeat Fran and make a name for themselves.  They say that they had annihilated the antidemon horde, but she didn’t look very strong.  Some of them attacked us with a shortsighted thought that they were lucky.  Moreover, they were all small fry. The most powerful ones knew that luck alone would not be enough to survive against the antidemon horde, and Fran could tell their strength.  From Fran’s point of view, she seemed to think that it was just right for her to be disciplined. As soon as they were being turned against her, they were happily fighting back.  However, it seemed that they made a slight mistake because of muscle pain, and Greater Heal was sure to be needed.  The next most common one was the fools who were trying to take in Fran.  They may have fighting prowess, but after all, they’re little girls with brain muscles. There were quite a few who thought that they could fool around. They ranged from small organizations that lost their power and were looking for strength, to adventurers who wanted to bring Fran into their party and former powerful people who wanted to intercede with their superiors.  Most of them would intimidate their subordinates but would give up on it because it was not their real strength. If they persisted, they would just resort to force.  Some of them even told us to take responsibility for their injuries, but all we had to do was send them out to the guards. The soldiers who were now working earnestly were all grateful to Fran, so they believed Fran’s words so much that it made me a little uneasy.  I’m not going to do it, but it was so easy that I could easily bear the false accusation.I have no intention of doing so, but it was so much easier that I could have a false accusation on my part.  I now understand why Quina and Frederick were able to easily drive their enemies away......  I guess that’s just how grateful Fran is for saving this town.  Some of them also had resentment toward Fran.  Some of them abandoned this town and fled.  Although my feelings were mixed, I guess it couldn’t be helped. It was only natural that those who didn’t have the power to resist would evacuate in case of a magic beast disaster.  However, this time it was different from a normal magic beast disaster.  After all, they would not forgive others when they were back after all. Many of them had stolen things from their neighboring houses as insurance, and most of them were captured by the residents. Fran herself, like me, didn’t seem to have any problems with those who had escaped.  They were not adventurers who had been requested, and if she couldn’t face them, it was only natural that she would run away.  She had no intention of blaming or disparaging those who had escaped. Fran thought seriously that she would run away if an enemy she couldn’t defeat showed up. I guess that was her ideal calm, rational, and free adventurer. I’m sure she’ll challenge herself when this happens.  However, as long as she escaped, she abandoned them. It seemed that she was negative about what she was trying to get back with just an apology.  She was free to run away, and she didn’t blame them.  But as long as she ran away, she should be responsible for her choice. That was Fran’s opinion.  And the fact that she had met the troubled scene and told them that was the cause of her resentment.  As the story spread to those who came back and forth, it seemed that Black Lightning Princess was planning to drive them out. Well, it was not completely wrong though.  Even now, those people were just staring at her.  Fran’s relatives, whether they were forced to do so or not, did not feel that they had saved her. However, Fran didn’t seem to care at all.  </p>
<p>『Fran.  Are you okay?』</p>
<p>(What is it?)</p>
<p>『No, those guys......』</p>
<p>(Nn.  It’s a shame, they were weak.  They don’t get overconfident.)</p>
<p>『Oh, that’s......』</p>
<p>(I wonder if any of them are a little stronger...)</p>
