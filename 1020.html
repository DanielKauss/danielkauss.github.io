</div><h1>Chapter 1020</h1><p>The giant antidemons formed a sphere and rolled over at a tremendous speed.</p>
<p>Apparently, it was a form that allowed us to increase our speed while eliminating the need for brittle limbs. We fought a similar enemy on the way to the castle. This may not be an unusual form for antidemons.</p>
<p>「Ruuoogh!」</p>
<p>「Haaa! Burn!」</p>
<p>Mea fired a flame at the giant antidemon as it rushed in. However, it was easily repelled by the surface and could not stop its huge body. It had a much higher defense than I had imagined.</p>
<p>When I attacked one of these perverts to get in the way, the damage was normal. Well, since it was regenerated instantly, the effect was only a little delayed.</p>
<p>But now it was almost no damage. In addition to the barrier and armor that had become much thicker, its tremendous spinning power was probably going to shatter whatever it touches.</p>
<p>Perhaps realizing that it was useless to just launch an attack on it casually, Mea launched a slightly different kind of attack. Rather than aiming at the main body of the antidemon directly, she activated her magic between the ground and the antidemons.</p>
<p>A huge explosion then occurred. It was an attack that put more emphasis on disrupting the balance due to explosions than on offensive power.</p>
<p>But even though there was a huge explosion right under her body, the giant antidemons showed no sign of change. Because of her tremendous rushing power and weight, she probably didn’t get freaked out by a slight impact.</p>
<p>「Then move from the side!」</p>
<p>Realizing that it wouldn’t be easy to hit head-on, Hilt launched an attack from the side. She struck from the side, since the force of her slash had little effect.</p>
<p>Hilt was repelled by something, but the antidemon only seemed to have a slight delay in their path.</p>
<p>As we were looking for a way to deal with this, the giant antidemons caught up with Fran and the others and passed them. It seemed that the giant antidemons were planning to ignore us and target Orfalve and the others who were running away.</p>
<p>At this rate, we would be caught up in and destroyed before Jayne’s Armed Stealth ability was activated.</p>
<p>Fran chased after the giant antidemons with all her might and unleashed her Heaven Judgement.</p>
<p>「Raaaaah!」</p>
<p>「Urooourgh!」</p>
<p>『That’s a tremendous impact!』</p>
<p>As the high-pitched sound echoed through the air, my blade deeply scratched the surface of the huge sphere. The movement of the giant antidemons slowed down slightly, but the price of it caused a crack in my blade, which greatly reduced my durability.</p>
<p>While she was trying to regenerate her blade, the antidemon rolled over again. However, while Mea and Lind were slowing down, they approached her and attacked from the sky. An intense magical power emanated from Sophie’s harp, and the Lind that Mea was holding shined brightly.</p>
<p>It seems to be a magical song that uses the user’s magic power to increase the offensive power of the weapon.</p>
<p>With an up-tempo dance song played as the background, Mea struck a slash from above. With an explosion that was even louder than before, the movement of the giant antidemons was completely stopped.</p>
<p>That’s certainly a divine sword. It may sound frustrating, but I was defeated by its simple offensive power. But it didn’t mean that it could handle all the antidemons either.</p>
<p>She blasted Mea away with something like a shockwave from her entire body. No, seeing her use the recoil to start moving again, did she just give her some energy to move her heavy body?</p>
<p>However, that alone was enough to greatly repel Mea and cause a lot of damage. It was just a backlash from moving that huge body, and it seemed to have been tremendously powerful.</p>
<p>Quina went to the rescue, so we can leave it to her.</p>
<p>Hilt, Urushi, and Fran attacked the giant antidemons, but they still could not stop them. Their magic was unleashed, but it was completely ignored.</p>
<p>At this rate, it really was――</p>
<p>「Get crushed!」</p>
<p>「Uuuuurghh!」</p>
<p>Suddenly, the body of a giant antidemon twisted and twisted. It was as if it had been crushed by an invisible giant hand.</p>
<p>『What about the current Earth Magic...!?』</p>
<p>「Over there!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>At where Fran pointed, there was an army of about a thousand people and a large man at the front of it. He held up a large military sword in his hand and was observing the antidemons with a keen eye.</p>
<p>「It’s pretty tough.」</p>
<p>「Ashwrath!」</p>
<p>「Fran, you’re going to join me too, okay?」</p>
<p>The demonkin man, wearing an intimidating aura that made anyone tremble, was Ashwrath, the Rank S adventurer, the strongest corner of this continent.</p>
<p>「This is the first time I’ve seen an antidemon that powerful.」</p>
<p>Ashwrath, who had slipped through the ground without a sound, landed beside Fran. He then observed the antidemons with a stern expression on his face. Rather than defeating them, he was surprised that he had begun to regenerate them immediately.</p>
<p>As I’d expected, they were a much stronger enemy than expected from an S-Ranked adventurer.</p>
<p>「Why would you be with the hydrangeas?」</p>
<p>「Well, it all comes down to it.」</p>
<p>Ashwrath appeared to be tangled up by the troops of General Hagane. They had been trapped due to the purple barrier, and he and Ashwrath had come to find out the cause of it.</p>
<p>「That’s certainly going to be very hard to beat. What happened to Isario and Ader?」</p>
<p>「I don’t know Isario. Under that castle......」</p>
<p>「For real?」</p>
<p>「Adr is over there」</p>
<p>「Is the Divine Sword Knight so weak that it can hardly sense us?」</p>
<p>Ashwrath had a bitter expression on his face. It was probably because he had misjudged his abilities.</p>
<p>「I should be able to defeat it on my own, but...」</p>
<p>「Don’t worry, we’re here too.」</p>
<p>「Yeah, I’m counting on you.」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>If Addle had been working with us earlier, we would have been able to defeat that giant antidemon. So, with the help of Ashwrath, someone on par with him, we should be able to defeat it this time. Mea and Sophie were now in there too.</p>
<p>「First, we need to get the whole army together.」</p>
<p>「Okay」</p>
<p>At last, I really saw the winner.</p>
<p>『Let’s start the counterattack!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
