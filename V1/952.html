</div><h1>Chapter 952</h1><p>After we heard about the Divine Sword, we parted ways off from the Silver Lady and headed to the Adventurers Guild. We asked the Silver Lady to watch over Nadia.</p>
<p>She didn’t seem to care about Nadia as a stranger either, so she accepted the request in two answers.</p>
<p>They had plenty of combat and mobility too. It would be enough for them to run away with Nadia in their arms in case of emergency.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve cleared up all the antidemons around Brutori, we’re done with our work here. We can leave for Nocta tomorrow. Fran wants to see Nadia as soon as possible.</p>
<p>We were walking quickly toward the guild.</p>
<p>However, there was something blocking our way. Well, I guess they just casually approached us at the entrance of the guild though.</p>
<p>But our opponent was the problem.</p>
<p>「Hey, young miss. Are you heading to the Adventurers Guild now?」</p>
<p>「......Nn.」</p>
<p>It was Adel and a group of other adventurers, Silard, who spoke to us. They didn’t look pale, and at first glance, they looked like normal.</p>
<p>However, their movements were slower than this morning, and they were clearly showing their composure. This was probably another pride of a large country.</p>
<p>We wanted to avoid it, but we couldn’t do anything about it once they waited at the entrance. They tried to hide their presence and slip past us as much as possible, but it seemed that they were really after Fran.</p>
<p>Immediately after the Silver Lady advised her to do so, I wondered what kind of trick she had.</p>
<p>「It’s a beautiful magic sword, isn’t it? Where did you get it?」</p>
<p>「...Master」</p>
<p>「Hou? You’ve inherited it from Master?」</p>
<p>The expressionless she wore in battle and the empty smile she was making right now. Even though they had completely different expressions, both gave the same impression. Perhaps it was because she had received a brainwashing education, she seemed to be somewhat unusual.</p>
<p>「I must distrust General Hagane. That country is a land of evil, one that does not people.」</p>
<p>「Hmm」</p>
<p>「You’ve probably seen the soldiers have pity on you. It’s a country that’s forcibly recruiting and defeating old men like them」</p>
<p>I felt sorry for them. Besides, I felt sorry for those old people who had been forced into the military. All I could tell you was that they were so motivated that they volunteered themselves.</p>
<p>Fran listened to Ader’s words with a look of determination on her face. Meanwhile, only Ader spoke, and the men behind her were staring at her.</p>
<p>But they weren’t just holding back. I could feel the faint movements of their magic power. Maybe these guys were the personnel search force that used appraisal.</p>
<p>However, her expression immediately changed to one of contempt. Perhaps she recognized Fran’s ability by appraisal and recognized her as a small fry.</p>
<p>「...Well then, thank you very much」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Adar seemed to have decided that Fran was useless because the men behind her didn’t say anything to her. Then she suddenly stopped talking and turned away.</p>
<p>We didn’t even have to use the excuse of being called by the guildmaster this time.</p>
<p>「......Okay, but I don’t have much strength left. I think I can only play one more time.」</p>
<p>I’m sure anyone with a discerning eye would find it suspicious if they didn’t have any information about him. Since he was a troublesome person, he probably didn’t actively complain or point out anything suspicious like we do.</p>
<p>As a result, they were unaware of their unnaturalness and just left there like that.</p>
<p>Besides, I’m sure Ader knew how talented Fran was... But she never mentioned it to the public.</p>
<p>『Hmmm, I don’t know if they’re afraid or dumb. I can tell that they’re not communicating well or just working together』</p>
<p>(I hate them.)</p>
<p>『Well, I’m glad you lost interest in me』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>『In the future, I’ll try to avoid meeting them as much as possible.』</p>
<p>(Got it.)</p>
<p>After that, we headed to our original goal of report on our return to the guildmaster, but...</p>
<p>There, an unexpected person was waiting for us. To my surprise, Replare, the Guild Master of Nocta, was waiting for us.</p>
<p>Replare gave a few greetings and explained why she had come to Brutori. And as a supplement, she was the master of Brutori.</p>
<p>「Study request?」</p>
<p>「Well, you’re right. To be honest, I’ve experienced too much unexpected happening during this antidemon season」</p>
<p>「You could say that it’s extraordinary. Obviously, it’s not the usual. There are too many powerful individuals.」</p>
<p>「That’s why we have decided to send personnel to investigate the central part of the continent」</p>
<p>「That’s powerful scouting with a small number of elites.」</p>
<p>Fran had been asked by the guildmasters to nominate her, a direct request from the guild. They couldn’t refuse without a good reason.</p>
<p>We might be able to do that because of exhaustion and disorientation, but Fran was very motivated.</p>
<p>She probably didn’t feel bad as she was relying on us, and the anomaly on this continent was directly related to Nadia’s safety. So, she would be happy to take on the job if she could eliminate the anomaly.</p>
<p>(Master, can we?)</p>
<p>『Well, we’re going to do some research now...』</p>
<p>Aside from destroying annihilation and defeating the commander, this was a request for investigation. Moreover, regardless of whether the investigation was successful or not, the request was completed as soon as the investigation in a certain region was completed. If the leader refused, the evaluation would definitely go down.</p>
<p>「You want me to go alone?」</p>
<p>「No, I’ll go with Isario-dono too」</p>
<p>If we stayed with Isario, we might get caught up in Ignis... But he wasn’t the kind of guy who would intentionally attack us, and when push comes to shove, we should try teleporting to get some distance.</p>
<p>If we were with Isario, we’d be pretty safe against strong antidemons. But the benefit was even greater.</p>
<p>What Fran was expecting from us was scouting and messengers. If push comes to shove, we can leave Isario behind and go back to report on the situation on her own.</p>
<p>「......Who are those guys from Silard?」</p>
<p>「They’ve already achieved their quota, and they’re not working for the guild. So, I can’t ask them to investigate it for me」</p>
<p>I thought she would refuse if she was going to stay with Addlers any longer, but my main concern was over her now.</p>
<p>「Okay, then I’ll take it」</p>
<p>「What happened to Silard? Well, I haven’t heard any good rumors yet」</p>
<p>「They haven’t done anything to me yet」</p>
<p>「Still...... If you ever need anything, come and talk to us. The guild will take care of it.」</p>
<p>「Please do so when the time comes」</p>
<p>「Ufufufufu, I’ll leave it to you. But please investigate it instead?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
