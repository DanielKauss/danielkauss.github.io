</div><h1>Chapter 984</h1><p>Status Level: 62/99</p>
<p>I quickly put up barriers after I judged that, and at the same time, a tremendous explosion of flames and roars shook the second unit.</p>
<p>The sphere-shaped antidemon dragonkin got thrown and exploded at the same time.</p>
<p>「Kuh......!」</p>
<p>『Fran! Are you okay!?』</p>
<p>「What the hell is this......!」</p>
<p>The blast blast from all directions made it impossible for her to even move.</p>
<p>I could see Fran’s skin charred in a blink of an eye because of the high heat that even my barrier couldn’t block. My blade then bubbled up, and my durability value was cut down.</p>
<p>I managed to recover Fran and escaped with Dimension Shift. I pushed myself too hard to intercept her, and it took her longer than usual to activate it.</p>
<p>Due to the flames and dust storming the battlefield, we couldn’t see what was going on around us. The flames contained powerful magic power, which also hindered my detection of skills.</p>
<p>And we couldn’t even sense the presence of the nearby Pine Snow-blooded Beast.</p>
<p>Of the ten antidemons, nine should have been sent flying far away, but the ball-type antidemon dragonkin had gone way too far.</p>
<p>At about 100 meters, it could not be completely nullified.</p>
<p>It was scary because we only get one direct hit from this. If everything had exploded at close range, Fran and I wouldn’t even know what would have happened to us.</p>
<p>After about a dozen seconds, our field of vision finally became clear. But Fran choked on with words and ran out of steam.</p>
<p>「I-I don’t know...」</p>
<p>『This is bad...』</p>
<p>More than half of the soldiers of the Kingdom of Hagane had fallen to the ground, which had been heavily gouged and covered with rubble. The bodies of many of the fallen soldiers were charred, their limbs bent, and were missing.</p>
<p>It was obvious from the damage to his body that he had not only fallen.</p>
<p>The damage was more than expected.</p>
<p>Still, some of the survivors were thanks to our efforts. They must have just barely used Berserk’s power to kill the power of the explosion.</p>
<p>Because of this, some of the soldiers behind her were standing unscathed.</p>
<p>The adventurers suffered almost no damage to General Hagane, who had suffered a great deal of damage.</p>
<p>Isario must have used Ignis’s power to set up the barrier. The flames must have been absorbed by the barrier and the impact should have been canceled out.</p>
<p>However, the remaining antidemons were still moving. Some of them were injured from being attacked during their attempt to escape into the barrier.</p>
<p>The explosion also eliminated most of the remaining antidemons.</p>
<p>But this was not the end.</p>
<p>『He’s coming!』</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>The humanoid antidemon dragonkin were closing in on the second unit, which was still in chaos.</p>
<p>Even without the sphere-type antidemon dragonkin’s suicide bombardment, we could destroy these enemies with just ten human-type antidemon dragonkin.</p>
<p>Well, there were only eight of them approaching, and two of them were attracted by Urushi. Although they were pretty tattered, they were standing around provoking hostility to themselves.</p>
<p>『We can’t lose either!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>So, what should we do now? Isario was still using his Divine Sword open, but any further strain would be dangerous.</p>
<p>Crunch.</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>『Huh?』</p>
<p>Suddenly, my field of view changed and Fran was surprised. But the most surprised was me. Why did I use teleport?</p>
<p>No, I knew it. They followed the fear that had suddenly begun to well up and fled. The fear was so great that I couldn’t help but feel it.</p>
<p>The source of her fear was a single girl standing still with eerie magic power mixed with black and white.</p>
<p>『Yeah, I didn’t feel strange about it either...』</p>
<p>(That black and white magic power, Berserk?)</p>
<p>『Belserk and his scabbard!』</p>
<p>Black magic power rose from the dragonkin and the sword, and white magic power rose from the sheath.</p>
<p>Just watching them made me feel anxious as if I wanted to escape from this place. Fran seemed to feel the same way, and her tail was hanging.</p>
<p>Fran, who had been fighting without running away from any enemies, was terrified of them when she saw the Pine Trees and Berserk in front of her. The Pine Trees right now was so intimidating.</p>
<p>Could it be that the Mad God’s Sword was about to be released?</p>
<p>That’s when Isario approached us.</p>
<p>「Hey young miss! Let’s get out of here!」</p>
<p>Isario shouted as he created a wall of flames between the antidemon dragonkin and the second unit. It was a terrifying wall of flames filled with Divine Power.</p>
<p>However, the person Isario said to be fleeing to was not an antidemon dragonkin. He was accompanying the adventurers to try to escape from the snow dragonkin. The wall of flames was probably intended to buy them time to escape without the antidemon dragonkin getting in the way.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Fran immediately began to move.</p>
<p>(Isario is in such a hurry.)</p>
<p>『Yeah! Urushi! Go ahead! Come back to us!』</p>
<p>(Woof?)</p>
<p>『I’m fine! More importantly, hurry!』</p>
<p>(W-Woof!)</p>
<p>Urushi can be called back by telepathy. When this happens, we have no choice but to escape.</p>
<p>As we turned our backs, we heard the voice of Zelos Reed.</p>
<p>「Show the truth about the violence. Crazy, break, Berserk! Divine Sword Release!」</p>
