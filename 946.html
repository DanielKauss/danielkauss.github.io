</div><h1>Chapter 946</h1><p>The old soldiers of the Kingdom of Hagane tried to kill the antidemons at risk of their lives, but they still springed up later. One hour after we returned to the bar, when the town’s security was about to be broken. The scout’s shouts as he jumped into the bar gave us an idea of most of the circumstances. The antidemons seemed to have approached Brutori three times. Isario, who had heard this, stood up slowly from his bar chair without trying to hide his darish look. When I heard this, Isario stood up slowly from his bar chair without trying to hide his darling atmosphere.  </p>
<p>「Are you going?」</p>
<p>「We don’t have any choice.  I didn’t plan to work this time.」</p>
<p> Fran tilted her head at Isario’s bad words.  </p>
<p>「What do you mean?」</p>
<p>「I didn’t expect there to be a third wave based on the scale of the business.  Well, that doesn’t mean that a prediction will definitely hit...... But strangely, I think there are a lot of them in the antidemon season.」</p>
<p>  Since they have an opponent, it would be difficult to predict their movements and numbers perfectly. Even so, it was the intuition of a Rank S adventurer who had been fighting on this continent for many years.  Maybe it was really different this time. However, the fight will be our first priority.  </p>
<p>「Are you going alone?」</p>
<p>「You seem worried about Uncle―― You’re not right, can’t you?  Don’t bring along with you if he says you want to fight like that」</p>
<p>「Why?」</p>
<p>「Even Uncle has to do his job. You’ll get scolded by important people if you don’t show them how an adventurer with a divine sword defeats the antidemons alone.」</p>
<p>「Working alone?」</p>
<p>「That’s right. We have to show them that there are people on this continent who have a divine sword.」</p>
<p>  Many people come and leave the continent of Gordicia.  Celebrities and tremendously powerful people, even the wielders of the divine sword, famous adventurers, and royalty, come to fight. There is no way they could stay in Gordicia for a long time without entertainment, no peace, and no honor. I guess his role was to show them such hope and let them know that they have not been abandoned.  </p>
<p>「Okay, let’s go.  Yeah, you can see it, but don’t get too close, okay?  I’ll use a divine sword. I don’t even know if I get burned, right?」</p>
<p> Isario said that and walked away with a ragged gait.  </p>
<p>「He’ll use a divine sword!」</p>
<p>『Calling me for advice might be the type that involves a lot of trouble.』</p>
<p>「Let’s go see it!」</p>
<p>『Yeah, but don’t get too close.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>  But we have to do the bare minimum before we chase Isario. We summoned the adventurers, who had been uneasy because they thought the antidemons had been defeated, and gave them instructions to be wary again.  Some of the adventurers looked unhappy, thinking that they should be okay since Isario was out. To be honest, I know how they felt.  I don’t think Isario would kill the antidemons either. There would be almost no chance that the antidemons would reach this town.  But what the dispatched adventurers were asked to do was to show them how seriously they work.  The Adventurers Guild does their job. It was their true job to show them that they were doing their jobs.  We couldn’t expose them drinking at the bar while they were waiting, but Diggins took a step forward to respond to the adventurers who complained while drunk.  He was probably planning to punish them. But here, Fran decided to take care of it herself, with the intention of tightening up.  The only thing she could do was to intimidate them with her skills and Urushi.  </p>
<p>「Grrrr!」</p>
<p>「... Nn!」</p>
<p>  Fran obeys Urushi as he groaned and quietly invokes her intimidation. But isn’t she a little strong? </p>
<p>「Hiii!」</p>
<p>「......!!」</p>
<p>  Not only the intimidated but also the adventurers around her were trying to overthink her without even saying a word.  They seemed to have been a little frustrated because they wanted to chase Isario quickly.  That must have turned into intimidation. I don’t mind though, since it had become too tight. Leaving Diggins and Urushi to handle the adventurers who instantly became obedient, Fran jumped out of Brutori. </p>
<p>「The fight is about to begin!」</p>
<p>『Yeah!  But we haven’t released Ignis yet!』</p>
<p> The antidemon advance party and Isario just collided.  Isario had a distinctive crimson sword in his hand.  It was probably Ignis, the fire sword.  It had waved blades on both sides, and several sharp blades that seemed to be facing the sky, as if they were made to resemble the shape of a burning flame. They were called Fran Berge.  It seemed that they have not yet been released from the Divine Sword. Isario, holding the Divine Sword, slowly began to fight the antidemons with his slow steps. But that was a strange scene.  </p>
<p>「Isario, don’t you fight too hard?」</p>
<p>『Yeah. I take it, sink it, stop it, and evade it.  She has skillfully used such techniques to defend against enemy attacks. He occasionally threw counters, but they were not that frequent.  Gradually, the number of enemies increased and surrounded everything around him. But even so, Isario continued to defend.  What did he want to do?  Gather them all up and exhaust them? As we were wondering what to do, a change came to the battlefield.  Suddenly, the antidemons around Isario collapsed and disappeared.  They didn’t seem to have done anything to them. It was really sudden.  </p>
<p>「Did you do something?」</p>
<p>『... I don’t know.』</p>
<p>  It was a completely different way of fighting than I had imagined.It was completely different from what I had imagined.It was completely different from what I had imagined. It was a quiet, unknown way of fighting.</p>
