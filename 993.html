</div><h1>Chapter 993</h1><p>「It’s time for our atonement today too. Let’s go, Juanaverta.」</p>
<p> Juanaverta! There’s no doubt about it! It’s the name of the Intelligence Weapon that Trismegistus supposedly had! Fran noticed too. </p>
<p>「!」</p>
<p> Trismegistus stared at the silver Falcion――Juanaverta. </p>
<p>「So that’s......」</p>
<p>If he was on Trismegistus’ level, he should have noticed Fran’s gaze. However, the golden dragonkin didn’t seem to care about Fran’s shards, and he started walking away defenseless. However, the golden dragonkin didn’t seem to care about Fran’s shards and started walking away defenseless.  It was not that he was ignoring her, he was not interested in Fran. Trismegistus walked leisurely, with Fran’s strong gaze on his back. With each step he took, his tails that were sticking out of the hem of his robe swayed from side to side.  He looked as if he was elegant. </p>
<p>「H-Hurry even more!」</p>
<p>「If you want to hurry, just hurry.  You priestess’ younger brother.  I’ll never stop you.」</p>
<p>「It’s Frederick.」</p>
<p>「If you want to remember, you’ll get even stronger.」</p>
<p>  Trismegistus didn’t laugh and said that back with a serious look on his face. Maybe he had to be a serious person to remember his name.  </p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>  I could see Frederick’s face contorting and glaring at him.  </p>
<p>「...You’re going first?」</p>
<p>「No, that’s dangerous.」</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>「The basement of this castle is where the most antidemons in the world spring up. You’ll only be killed in vain if you rush in on your own.」</p>
<p>  Frederick panicked, but did not try to get ahead. On the way to the room called the Nucleus room, a surprisingly powerful antidemon appeared in droves. Even the current Frederick would say that he couldn’t break through it. It seems that when he was still young, his parents had taken him away.  It seemed that all of the dragon warriors here were just a part of the passage process. They probably intended to inflict the greatest fear on their infants so that they could remain a little quiet and unfazed.  Trismegistus was the safest way to get through such a situation. All they have to do is to follow them and not tire themselves out.  Trismegistus, who was not interested in others, did not want to fight alongside them. He was willing to do whatever he wanted as long as we followed him.  That was a terrible irregularity in his offer to come along with him. Thanks to Isario, one of the few beings approved by Trismegistus.  After listening to the underground explanation, Trismegistus arrived at a large hall at the end of the castle.  It was a huge dome made of gray huge stones with almost no decorations. It was probably over 100 meters in diameter.  The path leading up to the dome was so beautiful that it stood out on its own.  There was no doubt that it was not a dance hall.  Immediately after entering the dome, Fran and Urushi shivered and stopped. But that was not surprising.  A huge, gray creature was sticking out from the center of the room through the floor.  There was no doubt about it.  It was the body of the Abyss Eater that we could see from the outside of the castle.  About half of the dome was probably occupied by the Abyss Eater. Even though it was this close, it looked like a huge tree.  However, it told me that the extraordinary magic power radiating from it was not a normal thing. The magic power should have been hundreds of times denser than the antidemons’ presence, and if it was made aggressive, it would have become this kind of magic power.  I guess it was more correct to say that it was in an agitated or starvation state. We were told that it wouldn’t move, but I could tell that it was still trying to devour us and devour us even in this state. I was very convinced that this doppelganger of antidemons was worthy of the cravings of antidemons.  Trismegistus went to a staircase next to the room, with Fran stopping to stare at the Abyss Eater. From there, we could go to the basement of the dome.  </p>
<p>「Miss Hilt...  Are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Don’t worry」</p>
<p>「From here on out, it’s hell.  Re-enter it」</p>
<p>「... Okay」</p>
<p>  Isn’t this what I call hell?  I couldn’t even imagine. It seemed like it wasn’t a nice place to go if we weren’t careful.  </p>
<p>『Fran.  Let’s go』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  Fran, along with Isario, followed Trismegistus.  The stairs were just any normal down stairs. But standing in front of them, I was convinced that there was hell at the end.  </p>
<p>「There’s a presence of antidemons.」</p>
<p>『Yeah. The antidemons so weak that I could sense them from within the aura of the Abyss Eater are scurrying about......』</p>
<p>  If all the antidemons up ahead were to be released, the continent would be annihilated in no time, isn’t it? I could feel the magic power of those antidemons so strong that I wondered about it.  </p>
<p>「Don’t worry.  I said this castle is protected by the Gods, right? It seems the antidemons in the basement never come out.」</p>
<p>  It seems the Gods locked the Abyss Eaters and antidemons in the basement of the castle. Trismegistus went down the stairs, the entrance to hell Isario said, without hesitation.  It must be an everyday occurrence for that dragonkin. As soon as he hurriedly followed us, a change came.  </p>
<p>「Let’s start」</p>
<p>  Trismegistus began to knead a huge amount of magic power as he went down the stairs. Even before it was released, his body was dyed in gold, and the air around it was trembling.  Even so, it was not violent.  It was nothing short of calm.  It was not him who raged in the face of battle.  Quinn!It must have been an everyday occurrence for that dragonkin. As we hurriedly followed behind him, a change came immediately. </p>

As if to make a warrior tremble in the face of a battle, the sword of the Silver Falcion trembled and barked high-pitched.</p>
