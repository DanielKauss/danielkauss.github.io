</div><h1>Chapter 1080</h1><p>We left the town of Kranzel and headed back to Barbra by force. Satia said she was accompanying her, but she didn’t push herself too hard. She probably understood that she couldn’t do anything self-absorbed in the Kranzel Kingdom any further. In a sense, she was a hostage. If Satia did something strange, we might be able to break the ties between the Kranzel Kingdom and the Kingdom of Philias. The Guild Master also asked them to stay with us if possible. The guildmaster also asked them to stay with us if possible.  Besides, I’d also like to ask Dirk’s guards to stay with us.The guildmaster also wanted us to stay here as long as possible.  He also wanted us to keep an eye on Dirk.  We wouldn’t know what might happen against someone of that level, and there was a possibility that Raidos would send a mouthwashing assassin for us.  </p>
<p>『We’re the Raidos army!  We made it just in time!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  The Raidos fleet, including the water dragonkin, was about to show up off just off of Barbra. It was still small like a bean, but it would take us less than an hour to reach Barbra.  From the sky, I could see that there were two water dragonkin lined up.  However, there were no Seedran’s ships. Apparently, all but the water dragonkin were battle ships from the Raidos Kingdom.  As we got closer, I could see that strong magic power was covering the entire area.  No doubt, there was a barrier. If we weren’t careful, they might be working together with the two ships to put up barriers to protect themselves more. But I already know how to fight to destroy the water dragonkin.  </p>
<p>『First of all――  </p>
<p>(Master, wait)</p>
<p>『What’s wrong?』</p>
<p>(Mal said he wanted to leave)</p>
<p>『What?』</p>
<p> Just as Fran stopped me, a translucent woman suddenly appeared in front of us. She was sure that she was Marl before she went out of control.  </p>
<p>『Oooh!  I can feel her presence!』</p>
<p>(Really?)</p>
<p>『Yeah!  My Spirit Detection skill is doing its job!』</p>
<p>  I possessed the skill “Spirit Detection”, but I’ve rarely done anything about it. It was probably when I severed the connection between Weena and Rhyn. This was probably why it was said that when communicating with spirits, it was not the presence of skills but the compatibility with spirits. This was exactly why I was not a good match with spirits, and Fran had a constitution that made her favorite among them. However, this time I was able to detect its presence for a little while, probably because Marl approved of me.  Well, it was just like what a spirit looks like!  </p>
<p>「...!」</p>
<p>  Marl didn’t make a sound and moved his hand wildly. It looked as if he was sending something like a signal to someone...  I could feel a slight movement of magic power.  It wasn’t aggressive, but was it Marl doing it?  As I watched over Marl with Fran, something strange happened right away. To my surprise, the strong magic that had covered the area around the water dragonkin had disappeared. When I activated a weak wind magic that I couldn’t even notice, I was able to touch the hull without getting interrupted.  The barrier was clearly gone.  </p>
<p>『Did Marl do it?』</p>
<p>「He asked for your help」</p>
<p>『Is Marl’s sister still a princess?! She’s on this water dragonkin too?』</p>
<p>「Nn.  Unlike Marl, she’s just being enslaved」</p>
<p> The translucent Marl bowed his head lightly to us and disappeared.  </p>
<p>『Does Marl know where the princesses are?』</p>
<p>「He says he knows」</p>
<p>『Then let’s rescue the princesses first and then destroy the fleet in droves』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p> Fran and Urushi then descended to the water dragonkin, hiding their presence. It would be difficult to find the current Fran unless they had special skills for detection or were very capable magic tools. Well, in the case of the water dragonkin, which was one of the most powerful forces in the country, it was likely that it had that level of security.  We deployed all our skills and magic at full power, and ran on the deck of the water dragonkin while hiding its appearance, presence, and magic power. We entered the ship without finding anyone and proceeded through the complicated interior without making any attempts to get lost.  </p>
<p>『Fran.  Do you know the way?』</p>
<p>(Mal told me)</p>
<p>『I see』</p>
<p>  It seemed that Fran and Marl were able to communicate more than I thought they would. In the end, we reached our destination without encountering anyone.  The water dragonkin could move with a small group of people, so there seemed to be only a small number of crew members.  There were almost no patrols.  Fran slowly opened the door and entered the inside.  There, she found a beautiful woman with silver hair and brown skin. No, she seemed to be conscious just lying on the bed.  After I blocked out the sound with wind magic, Fran spoke to the woman.  </p>
<p>「Hey」</p>
<p>「!  Who are you?」</p>
<p>「I’m Fran.  Adventurer. Are you Marl’s Onee-chan?」</p>
<p>「Maru!  That girl! Is she safe!?」</p>
<p>  Apparently this woman was definitely Marl’s Onee-sama.  In other words, she was the Princess of the Sea of Seedran.  She seemed to have a dignity in her behavior, and she certainly might look like a princess.  </p>
<p>「For now, we need to get out of here first. Marl asked me to help you」</p>
<p>「I see...  Yes, I’m Selimair, and I’m Marl’s Onee. But because of this, I can’t leave the water dragonkin」</p>
<p>  Selimair muttered sadly as she touched the collar on her neck. I guess the slave collar was limiting her actions.  </p>
<p>「It’s meaningless if you’ve lost consciousness, but that won’t get you out of there...」</p>
<p>「So, you want her to faint?」</p>
<p>「......But that’s not enough to carry me and run away, okay?」</p>
<p>「Nn.  No problem, Urushi」</p>
<p>「Woof」</p>
<p>「Kyaa!」</p>
<p>  Selimair let out a yelp at Urushi, who suddenly appeared from the shadows.  But it was not a scream of fear. She read the air and appeared in a puppy-type. After Semea got used to Urushi’s presence, Urushi changed his size to the size of a large dog.  </p>
<p>「Well, you’re amazing, aren’t you?」</p>
<p>「Nn.  Urushi can get bigger too. He can even carry Selimia too」</p>
<p>  He said that he could carry it, but he didn’t dare say that. It would be annoying if Selimia tried to back down.  </p>
<p>「Very well then」</p>
<p>「... You believe me?」</p>
<p>「Yes.  I’m going to have to look at people even after this. Besides, I felt like Marl was telling me to believe you」</p>
<p>「...I see」</p>
<p>「Yes」</p>
<p>  After that, we invaded the other ship and succeeded in rescuing her other sister, Princess Miriam.  It took us a while to get her to trust us more than Princess Semea though.  Besides, she didn’t look like a princess this time. In fact, the name of her was more like an adventurer.  Urushi had already escaped to carry Princess Semea, so Princess Miriam was carried by Fran to escape.Princess Miriam was carried by Fran to escape since Urushi had already escaped to carry her.  She evacuated again to the sky, but it seemed that a commotion was finally beginning to occur.  When the barrier had disappeared, they must have tried to check something with the princess.  And they noticed that she was nowhere to be found.  So slow!  </p>
<p>「Urushi, keep protecting the two of you」</p>
<p>「Woof」</p>
<p>「We’ll help the water dragons and destroy the fleet」</p>
<p>『Understood!』</p>
