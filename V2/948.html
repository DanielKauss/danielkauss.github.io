</div><h1>Chapter 948</h1><p>The Silver Lady suddenly appeared and advised Silard to be careful. What does she mean? We don’t know where she is now. She didn’t show any signs of hostility towards us...... But can we trust her? </p>
<p>「......What do you mean?」</p>
<p>「Those who have strong healing power or skills that can be inherited from their pedigree. And what his country is particularly focusing on is magic tools that allow him to give powerful skills to their equipment」</p>
<p> And what his country is especially focusing on is a magic tool that allows him to give powerful skills to their equipment」</p>
<p>  Crap, the last one I have an idea of. I think it’s probably one of the best in the world when it comes to the number of skills given to my equipment.  Come to think of it, I’m getting way too good with Alpha! If I could equip Alpha and me at the same time, I’d be in trouble.  As long as I don’t make sure they don’t know about me, the most important thing is how much caution I have to give to Addle. </p>
<p>「Adoru can be used for appraisal?」</p>
<p>  In some cases, she might have to keep avoiding Adoru as long as she is on this continent. Leaving Gordicia right now is also a thing to think about.  As for Fran, she wasn’t asking for the answer, she just wanted to hear her opinion. However, the Silver Lady made a firm statement.  </p>
<p>「I wonder if that’s the case」</p>
<p>「Is that so?  Appraisal is convenient」</p>
<p> It seems like Silard would be willing to screen or kidnap children with appraisal. </p>
<p>「It’s too convenient.  They’ll even know the dark and ugly parts of the country after all」</p>
<p> It seems that the country is also wary of the wielder of Alpha.  It would be terrible if the Divine Sword Knight tried to do a revolution.  It would be a opponent that could head-only retreat its troops. There was no way they could stop him if he betrayed them.  But that was probably why they didn’t want to give them any dark information about the country.  There was no way a large country could have any dirty parts. Moreover, Silard looks completely black, and I’m sure even Ader knows that he’s only doing the dirty work for his homeland. But I think he doesn’t know much about the dark side of things.  What if such a person tells us the truth about his country?  There’s always the chance that he’ll betray us. Perhaps he had already failed.  It seemed that the Divine Sword Knight’s perception when using Alpha had been strengthened without any mistakes.  After all, it was said that he could see through tens of thousands of kilometers. With all the dangers in mind, it was no wonder they came to the conclusion that Silard would not give Appraisal to the Divine Sword Knight.In view of the various dangers, it was no wonder they have come to the conclusion that Silard would not give an appraisal to the Divine Sword Knight.  For the country, strength on the battlefield was probably important, and their weapons were not to be used for anything.  Even so, I don’t think it’s possible to completely block their information, though......  They must have taken various other measures.  But would they be reassured if someone from Adar didn’t have an appraisal? We were relieved, but we were not yet relieved.  </p>
<p>「Silard has a department in Silard to find some useful people.  They may be accompanied by a few people with an appraisal.  Please don’t expose them to them.  You will use a high level recovery magic with a high fighting power. That’s what Silard wants you to do.」</p>
<p>「Can’t you have an appraisal blocking?」</p>
<p>「Depends on the skills I have, some may break through the Appraisal Jammer.」</p>
<p> Well, thanks to Heavenly Eye, we may be able to ignore the Appraisal Jammer. It’s not guaranteed, since it also depends on the opponent’s abilities and status.  But that can be told to us as well.  If the opponent has a higher-ranked Appraisal Skill, it is possible for them to steal some of their stats.  Will they allocate their points to skills that can prevent the opponent’s Appraisal?  Will they Superiorize Appraisal Obstruction or Appraisal Disguising? However, that would weaken Fran’s own preparation for Appraisal.  I hope that the Superiorized skill can also affect Fran...  As I was wondering, the Silver Lady held out something. At first glance, it looked like a silver bracelet without ornamentation.  </p>
<p>「What is this?」</p>
<p>「It is a magic tool that has the effect of blocking appraisal.  It is a first-rate product made by the Divine blacksmith Zechs, so the effect can be guaranteed. Please use it as I will.」</p>
<p>「... Why?」</p>
<p>「I said it before, but I am grateful to you. It’s all thanks to you that I’ve lost my reason for existence.」</p>
<p>  I’ve heard these words before.  She thanked me for some reason when I destroyed Overgrowth. She had taken away the Silver Lady’s reason for existence.  But that didn’t explain why she was grateful.  </p>
<p>「Why are you grateful?」</p>
<p>「...... I don’t know.」</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>「Now that Overgrowth has disappeared, I will stop working in the not-too-distant future.」</p>
<p>  No, so why am I grateful for that?  </p>
<p>「When I understood that, I was relieved.  Yes, that must be relief.  I was only given pseudo- and limited emotions to understand the emotions of the wielder......  I knew I wanted to break.  To put it simply, I wanted to die. I’ve been whispering to her for a long time and there was no trace of emotion on the Silver Lady’s face. But I could feel a hint of radiance.  </p>
<p>「It is thanks to you that I can break.  I can finish my role.  I can unload my shoulders. That’s why I am grateful.」</p>
<p>  The Silver Lady bowed her head deeply as she said that.  </p>
<p>「... I believe in you.」</p>
<p>『Oi, Fran.  It does not sound like you’re lying, though......』</p>
<p>(Don’t worry, this person is not lying.)</p>
<p>  The Principle of Falsehood didn’t work because she was a golem. However, Fran seemed to have decided to trust the Silver Lady.  Could it be that her natural instincts were at work? Such a feeling has been sharpened ever since she became a Divine Beast.  My appraisal couldn’t get through on the silver bracelet I held out. And when Fran received the bracelet, her appraisal began to work on the Silver Lady.  She was really a golem, wasn’t she? But I don’t know if it’s okay since her identity might be discovered in the future. When Fran asked her about that, the Silver Lady said nothing.  </p>
<p>「Either way, I’m not going to be working in a month’s time. Then, I would like to help you, my savior」</p>
<p>「A month?  Can I do something about it?」</p>
<p>「That’s fine.  Even if I have a way to prolong my life, I will choose to stay corrupt like this. That’s my wish」</p>
<p>「I see...」</p>
<p> Fran could only mutter with an indescribable look on her face.  </p>
<p>「... Thank you very much.  Is there anything I can do for you?  Please tell me what you want to know.  Or, is there anything I want to know? For example, are you not interested in the information about the Divine Sword?」</p>
<p>「Divine Sword?  You know more about the Divine Sword?」</p>
<p>「As for the ten Divine Swords that have been used most often on this continent over the past thousands of years, Alpha, Berserk, Chariot, Eldorad, Gaia, Ignis, Klisterus, Sanctuary, Tempest, and Wisdom, I’ve known their abilities to some extent by my observations」</p>
<p>  It was not only Alpha and Berserk who came out of her mouth.</p>

<p> It was not only Alpha and Berserk who came out of her mouth. The names of the completely unknown Divine Swords were Sanctuary and Wisdom.</p>
