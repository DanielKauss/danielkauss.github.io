</div><h1>Chapter 911</h1><p>Velmeria appeared in support, but she was not the only one leading the way.</p>
<p>『Isn’t this time a reinforcement? There’s quite a lot of people coming towards us right now.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Lots.」</p>
<p>The number of them was far over 100 now. There were probably 300 or 400 people in total. They were all moving in groups, and they were clearly a leading group.</p>
<p>However, his true identity was soon revealed.</p>
<p>I remembered the presence of someone leading the way.</p>
<p>「Mea! I’m back!」</p>
<p>『Yeah! You’ve got a hundred men!』</p>
<p>Mea came with the outlaws of the Beastmen Union to support us. The beastmen moved out of the walls through the cracks in the walls.</p>
<p>The girl with white hair and black armor smiled in the front.</p>
<p>「Fuahaha! I, come!」</p>
<p>「O-ojousan. Do you want to stand out?」</p>
<p>「No problem! Rather than such a trifling matter, focus on defense now!」</p>
<p>「Yes!」</p>
<p>Zefmate was waiting for Mea’s side. So, Zefmate must have been the one who was entrusted with the side work in this town.</p>
<p>Well, Zefmate was getting stronger enough. It must be a very reassuring force for us.</p>
<p>「This is your first time talking to a saintess in person, isn’t it? I’m late! I’m sorry! I had to shut up the stubborn elders and get rid of the dragonkin who attacked me for some reason, but I had time like this!」</p>
<p>It seems the Dragon King really did interfere.</p>
<p>「T-that’s it! T-That’s it!」</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>「Young miss, I don’t know what she’s after then」</p>
<p>「U-umm. I know, but...」</p>
<p>It reminded me of Mea, back when we first met Fran. Perhaps her friend wanted to say something like friendship, but she was so embarrassed that she couldn’t really say it.</p>
<p>If there was Quina here, I could use her poison tongue to release Mea’s tension and push her back. Zefmate, we’re not done yet!</p>
<p>「I’m Mea, and I’m Fran’s friend! You’re right too, right?」</p>
<p>「I’d be happy if you thought I was friends...」</p>
<p>「If we fight together, we will be our friends! Fran agrees. And if we are Fran’s friend, we will be my friend too! Let’s protect this town together!」</p>
<p>Oh yeah, Mea! Somehow, even I’m happy!</p>
<p>「Kuh. You’re right. I’d be happy to fight alongside you.」</p>
<p>Sophie’s smile appeared on Sophie’s face, which seemed depressed as she took the trash out of the holy knight and dragonkin one after another.</p>
<p>「Fuhahaha! Leave it to me!」</p>
<p>Mea also laughed loudly and was filled with motivation.</p>
<p>「I’m going, Zefmate!」</p>
<p>「Yes!」</p>
<p>Mea pulled out her Dragon Sword Lind and jumped straight from the top of the wall towards the antidemons below her. Flames then flared up from her back, as if she had acquired wings of flame.</p>
<p>He looked cool too, but I didn’t get to see what he did. To my surprise, I activated four Verniers at the same time.</p>
<p>To think that she could use a Vernier that was difficult to control at the same time, so skillfully... Mea must have trained quite a bit.</p>
<p>Mea, whose tail of fire had been ripped, rushed through the sky at a tremendous speed and plunged into a horde of antidemons. A huge explosion, as if it had rained down a meteorite, blew the antidemons away.</p>
<p>The impact was so powerful that even we, the onlookers, were worried about it.</p>
<p>Don’t tell me it was a suicide attack, right? But soon, a cat beastman girl in white fire appeared from the crater.</p>
<p>It wasn’t even a trace of dust. How can I stay unscathed in that situation? Maybe it’s thanks to my barrier and the flame nullification skill......</p>
<p>「Mea!」</p>
<p>「Fuhaha! Sorry you kept me waiting, Fran!」</p>
<p>As expected of Fran. Unlike me, she didn’t even have any doubts about Mea’s safety. She didn’t seem to be confused and cheered.</p>
<p>「With me here, the victory is certain!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>It really saved us. However, I asked her something that had been bothering me a little.</p>
<p>『Mea, do you have any information on what’s going on with the other gates?』</p>
<p>「Don’t worry! Beat up all the superiors of the Beastmen Union and make the organization yours. Now the Bloodfang Brigade leaders are leading the way to each gate!」</p>
<p>「Then you’re safe?」</p>
<p>『Well, the ones from the Bloodfang Brigade are pretty skilled. As long as there are many antidemons, we should be fine.』</p>
<p>I guess it took them a while to dispatch such forces.</p>
<p>『Mea, do you know anything about the other organizations?』</p>
<p>「The adventurers have already started fighting at each gate, so we don’t know who the dragonkin and tower are!」</p>
<p>「Our friends in the Dragon King Syndicate have been packed into each gate. All three claws are scattered throughout the gate.」</p>
<p>After hearing Mea’s words, Velmeria came down nearby and told us what she was saying. Of course, she was fighting.</p>
<p>They must have dashed here after finishing their moves so that the others wouldn’t be knocked down.</p>
<p>This battlefield was just next to the east gate, so it could be said to also be used to defend the east gate. In other words, each gate was well guarded. So, I didn’t have to worry anymore.</p>
<p>「I see! Then we can fight without worries!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Then, the two black and white girls began to fight side by side. They seemed to get along pretty well. They were in perfect sync, without even discussing anything at all.</p>
<p>「You’ve gotten even stronger! Fran!」</p>
<p>「Mea too!」</p>
<p>「Hahaha! It would be a problem if you were surprised by something like this! In order to catch up with you, I’ve also developed a special technique!」</p>
<p>「T-That’s my trump card! Amazing!」</p>
<p>「I see! If someone a little more challenging, I’ll have a chance to show them what I’ve got! Looking forward to it!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Wait a minute. With this in mind, it would be a bit awkward to go on an enemy that needed to use her strongest move......</p>
<p>「Become the ashes!」</p>
<p>「An opening!」</p>
<p>You guys seem to be having a good time in the middle of the battlefield, huh?</p>
