</div><h1>Chapter 1070</h1><p>「Fran, can you do something you didn’t see and retreat?」</p>
<p>「I don’t want to fight you. I’m begging you」</p>
<p>「...Why are you killing the villagers?」</p>
<p>「That is――」</p>
<p>「The prince! I don’t have time to argue with you now! Now, little girl! What happened to Rayus!? You were fighting him just a moment ago, weren’t you?」</p>
<p>「Wind Demon, I’ve defeated him」</p>
<p>「Nnnn. Even though he was a young boy who had just received a demon, he should be reasonably strong in the sky... Your existence is not for our country’s sake! We’ll eliminate him!」</p>
<p> We’ll be eliminating you!」</p>
<p>  The demon knights shouted and held their spears.  Then, Pune and Ronowe also braced themselves for battle.  They were surrounded by three demons. However, Fran showed no signs of pressure.  </p>
<p>「Fran.  surrender!」</p>
<p>「Please!」</p>
<p>「...So you’re giving up on killing the villagers?」</p>
<p>「I can’t do that.  Then I’ll refuse.」</p>
<p>  As soon as Fran refused, the demon knights started chanting magic. </p>
<p>「Kill them all!」</p>
<p>(If we fight here, a lot of people from the village will die.  So, I’ll win before it turns into a fight!)</p>
<p>『Got it! Urushi, the demons from the princes!』</p>
<p>(Woof!)</p>
<p>「Brilliant Lightning Rush, Sword God Transformation, Black Lightning God’s Claw!」</p>
<p>  Fran stepped forward at once, using her skills.  Black lightning overflowed from Fran’s body, and the acceleration made her body leave an afterimage. To the current Fran, she would look like she had stopped. I’m going to put all my strength into this one moment.  </p>
<p>『Great Magic-User, Divine Manipulation, Evil Conquest...!』</p>
<p>  Magic and Evil Spirits welled up from inside me.  I’m getting used to the Evil Spirits as well. But like before, I didn’t get attacked by the cold air and blended the power I drew and put it on my blade.  Divine, evil, and black lightning mixed, creating an indescribablely nasty power that enveloped me. I could definitely feel my blade being whittled down and my blade being worn off.  In fact, my durability value had diminished at a tremendous pace.  However, I was strong. There was no doubt about it.  The flame magic that the demon knight unleashed could also be repelled with a single swing.  Fran thinned into the demon knight, scraping off the residue of the flames that flew like a spark.  </p>
<p>「That is――」</p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>  The demon knight’s eyes widened and grunted at the tremendous power that suddenly erupted from Fran.  Even so, he reacted and thrust his spear out. As expected, such a spur-of-the-moment attack could not hit him. At about the same time as the demon knight thrust his spear out, his body was slashed by the slash. A few moments later, after Fran passed through the passage at a great speed, the demon knight’s body slid off and his torso fell to the ground. </p>
<p>「You shouldn’t let your guard down......」</p>
<p>「Damn!」</p>
<p>  Defeat the demon before it is freed from its power.  This was the sure-fire way for demon knights to defeat it. Well, they would need enough offensive power to defeat the demon knights, even in their bare condition.  That would have already cut the path to discussion. After calling the demon knight’s name and seeing the stunned prince in disbelief, Fran ran toward her next goal without stopping. The target is not the princes, but the demons they use. </p>
<p>(First, come this way!)</p>
<p>『How is Ronowe!』</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
<p>  Fran slashed at Ronowe, the female-type demon in the vicinity. Urushi, as a feint, unleashed a weak death poison spell at Fran and Satia.  However, Ronowe did not move his body and transformed his arm into a long tentacle to block it. He quickly entered his bosom at that divine speed and slammed me into his leg. He was too tall to reach his torso. Ronowe’s legs were cut off by a lethal slash, and his body was――  </p>
<p>『What?』</p>
<p>「Keho―」</p>
<p> I couldn’t cut him!  His body transformed into a smoke, and he just slipped through it! The poison that killed the Raidos soldiers along the way must have been Ronowe’s.  What was terrifying was that he had broken through Fran’s resistance to abnormal conditions and had given him a deadly poison. Fran must have sucked only a little of Ronowe’s poison.  So, what was with this power...?  Well, if she knew that poison was coming, she could handle it.  She could absorb it with my Poison Control skill, or she could easily heal it with her healing magic. But for Fran, that was not all.  If Ronowe tried to use poison to massacre the villagers, the recovery would be in time. And more and more, we had to kill Ronowe first.  But first, there was one thing I had to try. I focused my thunder magic as much as possible on it and fired it.  What I aimed for was a magic stone in the center of the plaza.  It was obviously meaningful. A lightning bullet that could inflict damage even on a dragonkin struck the magic stone.  But nothing happened.  That magic stone.  It was not only tough, but it seemed to be protected by a magical barrier. I never expected it to not even be a slight movement.  </p>
<p>「It’s useless.  I won’t let you destroy it.」</p>
<p>「Frut!  Satia!  What happened?」</p>
<p>「... Fran, I’ll ask you one more time. Can you back down?」</p>
<p>「I won’t back down.」</p>
<p>「... Satia can use poison!  While I’m suppressing Fran!」</p>
<p>「Understood!」</p>
<p>  Fran and Pune were trying to lure Fran away and kill the people with Ronowe’s poison. I could feel their firm determination that the villagers must be annihilated no matter what happens.  </p>
<p>「Kuh! I won’t let you!」</p>
<p>「Foooourgh!」</p>
<p> Fran fired a few slashes, but Ronowe’s entire body was already covered with poison mist. </p>
<p>『Let’s do this!』</p>
<p>「Fuoaaaaahh!」</p>
<p>  In the middle of the poisonous fog, it seems that his resistance to flame magic and lightning magic had decreased. Ronowe reappeared and screamed as the fog in the surrounding area was scorched.  </p>
<p>「Bweh!  Get her!」</p>
<p>『Fran!  You bastard!』</p>
<p>「Uuoooourgh!」</p>
<p>  Booom’s appearance disappeared and appeared behind Fran.  It was a shadow shift. Fran managed to deflect the handle of the great sickle that her huge body wielded, but it was soon blown away behind.  </p>
<p>『Telekinesis?  Be careful! Quite strong!』</p>
<p>(Okay!)</p>
<p> Booom seemed to be able to use quite powerful telekinesis. I noticed it and hit my telekinesis, but it could only weaken it. </p>
<p>「Ughiia...」</p>
<p>「Aaaahh...」</p>
<p>  Oh!  That’s not good! Ronowe’s poison quickly dispersed the detoxification spells to the villagers, but they managed to make it in time.  </p>
<p>「You said you’ve already broken the poison?」</p>
<p>  Satia was astonished to think that Fran had used detoxification magic in an instant.  However, if things continue like this, the villagers will sooner or later be affected. There was no point in doing so!  </p>
<p>『Urushi!  Attack Satia herself!  Don’t kill her! I’ll do Franto!』</p>
<p>(Woof!)</p>
<p>The only way to clear them up with speed was to shut them up.</p>
