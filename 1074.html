</div><h1>Chapter 1074</h1><p>Fran then held me up to destroy the magic stone.</p>
<p>Instead of swinging it, she folded her arms tightly and pulled back. This was not a slash, but a thrust.</p>
<p>Fran then concentrated all her power into a single point.</p>
<p>Fran kneaded the magic quietly, and I used the Great Magic Beast and Evil Conquest to strengthen myself.</p>
<p>As if to show how strong my sword blade was, I heard a high-pitched creaking sound and my durability value was slowly starting to decrease. It was a burden that made me think that the surface of the sword blade was being whittled down. Still, I continued to enhance it.</p>
<p>「Fuh...」</p>
<p>Fran meditated both her eyes and took a long breath in front of the huge magic stone that she was carrying.</p>
<p>「Phew.........―!」</p>
<p>The deeper she took her breath, the more power she could draw from within Fran.</p>
<p>Then, right after a very long breath, Fran snapped her eyes open and thrust me out with the power of her entire body.</p>
<p>「Haaaaah! Black Lightning God’s Claw!」</p>
<p>Just like when she destroyed a magic stone weapon in the Kingdom of Belioth, she activated her Black Lightning God’s Claw. However, what was different from that time was that her control over it was perfect.</p>
<p>Black lightning then focused on my tip, spinning like a drill.</p>
<p>I, clad in overwhelming power, was thrust into the magic stone――</p>
<p>「I did it」</p>
<p>『Yeah!』</p>
<p>It used to be a challenge to even scratch them, but this time it was a complete victory. Fran’s thrust broke the defense of a huge magic stone, and the tip of the thrust completely pierced through the magic stone.</p>
<p>Well, Fran and I have grown a lot!</p>
<p>My body absorbed the huge magic stone and disappeared.</p>
<p>『Uwooooh! Come on!』</p>
<p>Come to think of it, it was the same before......! A tremendous amount of magic power then flowed into me, and my mind went blank.</p>
<p>But I’ve been through this a few times already. And it’s nothing compared to when I absorbed two swords. I managed to stay conscious and calm down.</p>
<p>(Master, are you okay?)</p>
<p>『Yeah, no problem』</p>
<p>(I see. Thank goodness.)</p>
<p>Oi, oi, my stats show magic stone points higher than 2000! Seriously? The owner of this magic stone must have a threat level of A or higher!</p>
<p>Moreover, my skills were strange. To my surprise, I had acquired four strange skills. Flame Dragon Magic, Dragon Roar, Dragon Scale Inferno, and Dragon Scale Strengthening. That magic stone must have belonged to the Flame Dragon. As the name suggested, Flame Dragon Magic was magic used by Flame Dragons. Honestly, there was no magic that I didn’t know how to use it like this even after I had acquired the skills.</p>
<p>I couldn’t see anything in my head either. They couldn’t use Dragon Roar, Dragon Scale Inferno, or Dragon Scale Strengthening as well. It must be a skill that only a dragon could use.</p>
<p>I was not the only one surprised.</p>
<p>「Haha... What,...!」</p>
<p>Fran’s eyes widened in surprise, and she immediately twisted her face in self-mockery. Well, it was no wonder she reacted like that.</p>
<p>They decided that they couldn’t destroy its huge magic stone and tried to kill the villagers. Moreover, they ended up hostile with Fran because of it.</p>
<p>Well, it was also bad for the two demon knights to go out of control. With clear killing intent, Fran, who was already quiet, responded in her battle mode.</p>
<p>Besides, since they had taken out the country and urged us to hurry, Fran and Satya took action in a panic.</p>
<p>At the same time, Fran’s real strength must have been misjudged. Considering what she was capable of when we first met, both of them were much stronger than Fran. I didn’t want to say it that way, but I didn’t think that talking to Fran would solve the situation, and I thought that she would be able to capture her without killing her.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it have been better if she had told Fran everything from the beginning and asked for her cooperation?</p>
<p>「...If I believed in Fran, I’m sure I’ll get different results...... Ah, what absurd things...... Hahaha.」</p>
<p>He seemed to be more frustrated in trying to kill the villagers than in himself for being cursed and dying.</p>
<p>「......Hey, hey. What the hell do you think you’re doing?」</p>
<p>「Frut! I’ll do something about it! I’ll do something about it!」</p>
<p>「Yo-you’re right... But, you’re right...」</p>
<p>「Frut!」</p>
<p>「Gah......!」</p>
<p>「Frut!」</p>
<p>Fran spit out an even greater amount of blood than before, and her face was missing from the mix.</p>
<p>Fran unleashes a series of healing magic attacks, but the knife prevents her from healing. However, if she pulls off this knife forcibly, Fran will take a lot of damage. In the first place, even a light touch would cause intense pain for her.</p>
<p>「Then!」</p>
<p>Fran then held me at her waist. She then began to build up her magic power, but she might be more focused than when she destroyed the magic stones.</p>
<p>Then she paused for a few seconds and fell silent.</p>
<p>Fran then sank so deep that it looked as if she was about to collapse into the ground and delivered a horizontal slash to the sleigh of Fran’s body.</p>
<p>There was no sound or shock. But――</p>
<p>「Muh?」</p>
<p>『Whoa!』</p>
<p>Magic power flowed into me. And at the same time, the knife disappeared. I was hoping that by destroying it, the knife’s ability would be lost, but...</p>
<p>『Cannibalism activated?』</p>
<p>I don’t know everything, but the target of my cannibalism was an intelligence weapon or a failed divine sword. Maybe I could even use a divine sword for it.</p>
<p>A knife didn’t seem to have a will of its own, and of course, it was not a Divine Sword.</p>
<p>『So, it was a failed divine sword...?』</p>
<p>That stats hadn’t increased much, hadn’t it? He was on the weaker side of the Discarded Divine Sword? However, he had gained a skill, his name was “Demon Slayer”. It weakened demons, doubled damage to them, and even the ability to detect them.</p>
<p>(Master?)</p>
<p>『Oops, I’ll explain it later. Let’s help Fran for now』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p>The curse was still not broken, and blood was pouring from her wounds. Fran and I continued to use recovery magic imbued with the Divine Attribute and tried our best to save Fran.</p>
<p>A few minutes later.</p>
<p>『Do you manage to get it back?』</p>
<p>「Nn...」</p>
<p>Fran had used too much magic power, which was perfect, but there was a hint of redness on Fran’s face. The pass was probably over.</p>
<p>『Well then, what are we gonna do now?』</p>
