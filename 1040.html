</div><h1>Chapter 1040</h1><p>After saying goodbye to Trismegistus and the others, we were now back in Nocta. We were going to rest our bodies in this city for now.</p>
<p>「Fran! You’re safe!」</p>
<p>「Well, Fran! You’re back!」</p>
<p>Sophie and Mea greeted us at Nocta. We left earlier. Thank goodness, Sophie was surprisingly fine.</p>
<p>Nelsh, their guard, was also perfectly positioned behind Sophie. I could feel their strong will to not move away any further, as if the battle against the giant antidemons had been left unattended.</p>
<p>Ashwrath, who had been unconscious when we parted, also leaned on the gate and waved his hand over us. He didn’t seem to care until now.</p>
<p>「Nn! There weren’t any antidemons around, so no problem.」</p>
<p>「Like I thought, we haven’t encountered any antidemons either. Is this proof that the Abyss Eater has been weakened?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Somehow, there won’t be any antidemons in a few days. There won’t be a few antidemons left after all?」</p>
<p>Fran recounted what Trismegistus had to say to the two. Well, it was too difficult for her to remember much, but she understood the important part.</p>
<p>「Those who can’t fight, go out...? That’s not what I’m forced to do.」</p>
<p>「Hmmm. That’s quite difficult.」</p>
<p>Sophie expressed her anger, while Mea was bewildered. Since Sophie herself was on the side of the horde, she knew just how hard it would be for her to escape from Gordicia.</p>
<p>Mea seemed to be thinking about what would happen after she escaped from the continent of Gordisia. Even though she was such a young woman, she still knew how difficult it would be for her to accept refugees.</p>
<p>「If I were an extreme part of the Beastmen, I could handle it with my authority alone. But if I have thousands of people, I need to consult with my country.」</p>
<p>「If you’re the Beast King, you’d better be fine with Gahaha」</p>
<p>「Fran, is that a fool’s father? Well, he’s certainly a king after all. I can’t nod that easily.」</p>
<p>The Beast King, too, looked bold and was firmly in his throne. He would not make any serious decisions on his own.</p>
<p>Moreover, the people living in Gordicia, aside from the knights, soldiers, and adventurers of other countries, were most likely to be serious criminals or their descendants. There was a high risk for the country to accept them just because they looked so pitiful.</p>
<p>「However, if the word of God is brought out, it would be a problem to reject it completely. We would try to convince other countries that are taking advantage of the Commitment for Gordisia first, but would they accept those who want to leave the continent as settlers?」</p>
<p>Being a frontier is quite hard work in this world. Well, it wasn’t an easy job on Earth, but the level of danger in this world is different.</p>
<p>In many areas that were still untouched by humans, it was a dangerous area in the first place where many magic beasts were inhabited.</p>
<p>Crowds of people, from both inside and outside the tower, started gathering around the edge of the pit.</p>
<p>In other words, they were not the same as when they were in Gordicia. On the contrary, for the people who lived normal lives in the cities of Gordicia, they were in a hellish state from heaven.</p>
<p>「I see......!」</p>
<p>「Sorry about that」</p>
<p>「No, it’s not Mea’s fault. But is there any other way?」</p>
<p>「Hmm... I’m sorry, but they don’t come out immediately. But if I think about it, there might be other good ways」</p>
<p>「Nn! I’ll think too!」</p>
<p>「......Thank you.」</p>
<p>She was talking about something important, but I felt kinda relieved. It was the beautiful friendship between the girls. I’m glad that Fran and Mea have more friends.</p>
<p>Then a new figure approached us.</p>
<p>「Fran!」</p>
<p>「Velmeria!」</p>
<p>It was Velmeria, the water-haired dragonkin girl. It was the last time I had seen her tattered, but she seemed to have recovered considerably.</p>
<p>I had never seen her untie her ponytail before, but she looked like a young lady combined with a white dress. No, she was just a young lady, since she was a child between nobles and priestesses.</p>
<p>「I heard from Fran and Urushi that you saved our lives. Thank you」</p>
<p>「I’m glad I’m safe」</p>
<p>「......It wasn’t really useful for fighting though.」</p>
<p>There were no hands or feet to touch, and the enemy manipulated her, and finally, Urushi let her escape. Velmeria, who recognizes herself as a warrior, must have had no patience in this battle. She clenched her fists and lowered her head.</p>
<p>「But they’re still alive」</p>
<p>「...Yeah. Besides, it was thanks to you that I was able to see my mother again」</p>
<p>Frederick and Tilanaria were standing a short distance away. Tilanaria had a strong image of a half-crazed manipulating her, but now she had a gentle expression on her face.</p>
<p>Her hair was of a different color, but her face was probably very similar to that of Velmeria.</p>
<p>「What about Velmeria?」</p>
<p>Suddenly, Fran asked that question. Come to think of it, Velmeria was the number one person who couldn’t get out of this continent, right?</p>
<p>They were wanted and half-dragonkin in and around the Kingdom of Kranzel. We were in a position to take the aftermath of the request to leave the continent of Trismegistus.</p>
<p>She had already heard from someone, but her face looked somewhat smacked.</p>
<p>「I’m a warrior. My mother was originally a priestess, so I can handle it. Frederick will...... Well, I don’t know what he’ll do next, okay?」</p>
<p>In Frederick’s case, he was the opposite of Velmeria. Due to the dragonkin’s laws, he was not allowed to stay on this continent.</p>
<p>Still, Velmeria didn’t seem to be pessimistic, and maybe this will really work.</p>
<p>One hour after we reunited with Fran’s friends.</p>
<p>After throwing a difficult report at Isario and the others, Fran went to Mulsani’s Ladirua Trading Company. I wanted to check on Nadia’s condition, but...</p>
<p>「Fran, it looks like you’re worried」</p>
<p>「Auntie!」</p>
