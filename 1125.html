</div><h1>Chapter 1125</h1><p>On the fifth day of the Fran’s Bootcamp.</p>
<p>We were planning to reach our destination of the front line today. They were no longer forced to run, just a normal escort.</p>
<p>Just in case, Fran still called the warriors “better than goblins”, and the warriors had a mysterious rule that all the words should have curry at the end of it.</p>
<p>At the very least, they had completely eliminated malice and hostility, and were becoming more serious about their work.</p>
<p>Before our departure, the faces of the rude people who caused a commotion disappeared, and we saw a serious soldier there. He was moving, talking, and obeying Fran’s orders.</p>
<p>They didn’t move on their own, and there was no more fighting or commotion here. On the contrary, they were even giving each other encouragement and helping each other.</p>
<p>Even I could tell she was serious as if she had been reincarnated. If things continued like this, she wouldn’t get caught by Mareficent and be thrown into the training hell.</p>
<p>I don’t know what will happen to Fran’s rank up though.</p>
<p>However, it seemed that this transportation event, which had been going on for a long time, was not over yet.</p>
<p>(Master, something’s coming.)</p>
<p>『Quite a lot. And...』</p>
<p>(Evil energy.)</p>
<p>『Yeah』</p>
<p>A large group of people approached us without any attempt to hide their will to fight. Considering that they were coming in a straight line, they were clearly heading for this transport unit.</p>
<p>At first, I thought he was a scout from Raydoss, but apparently not. There was an evil spirit emanating from his group.</p>
<p>They also showed no sign of being human and seemed to be a pack of evil beings. Some of them were quite strong too, so they were probably not just small fry like goblins or kobolds.</p>
<p>『I guess we can just escape with this』</p>
<p>(Nn. We’ll intercept them.)</p>
<p>Fran always thought the battle was in order and began sending orders to the valiant soldiers.</p>
<p>「Some are still approaching. Protect the wagon!」</p>
<p>「「「「Yes! Captain! Curry!」」」」</p>
<p>Even at a time like this... Well, that’s fine. I guess that means she’s being that serious.</p>
<p>「Malfiscent, Persona. I’ll cover for you if it’s too dangerous for everyone」</p>
<p>「Well, it’s an emergency after all」</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>As expected, she didn’t say that she only did chores like this. With this, most of the patients will be fine.</p>
<p>Fran, who is equivalent to an A rank, will be joined by active A and B rankers.</p>
<p>We didn’t go any further, but waited in the plains, where there were few shields. After about ten minutes, the group in question appeared.</p>
<p>(Undead.)</p>
<p>『Yeah, the one in the center is pretty strong.』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p>About twenty undead appeared. All of them were of the highest rank, the Genoside Ghouls. The ghoul in the center of the room was overwhelmingly filled with evil energy.</p>
<p>The soldiers simply turned pale in the face of the evil energy leaking out.</p>
<p>I bet Threat Level B wouldn’t go down. If it had been boosted by Evil Spirits, it might have reached Rank A.</p>
<p>They were a force that could defeat a small country on their own. They were not a group that could suddenly show up in a situation like this.</p>
<p>I think the Black Skeleton Army was here, but what did evil spirits mean? Did they come up with a technique to strengthen the undead with evil spirits?</p>
<p>Maybe that was the reason why they decided to eliminate Rank A adventurers.</p>
<p>Fran shouted out as the undead rushed toward her.</p>
<p>「S-Stop! We’ll count ourselves as enemies if we don’t get any closer!」</p>
<p>I’m sure it was meaningless, but I wanted to know what our enemy was after. That was what I just talked to them about, but...</p>
<p>The undead stopped in their tracks.</p>
<p>Eh? How hostile.</p>
<p>However, she did not stop after hearing our warning.</p>
<p>『He’s chanting a spell!』</p>
<p>「Let’s start the long-range attack!」</p>
<p>「「「Curry!」」」</p>
<p>In the end, the end of the battle was opened without being able to get any information. Magic and arrows flew around, and sometimes stones were thrown in as well.</p>
<p>However, in their long-range attacks and defenses, both sides failed to deliver a decisive blow. Since they were the top species of ghouls, they fired a series of deadly poison magic attacks. This one had Fran’s healing magic, and the wide-area barrier that Marellicent used blocked all of their magic attacks.</p>
<p>However, they were also deploying evil barriers, and our attacks couldn’t hit them either. Fran and Persona’s magic could reach them, but the power of the magic had decreased, making it impossible to make a decisive blow, and they were quickly regenerated.</p>
<p>They flew at each other for a few minutes, and no one fell out of either fighter.</p>
<p>In that case, our next priority would be close combat.</p>
<p>Genoside ghouls lurked through the long-range attacks, becoming lumped together and thinning out. Moreover, twenty ghouls were concentrated in one place.</p>
<p>『These guys are after Fran!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Did she just say they saw her off as their commander? Or did she just want to get rid of the healers first?</p>
<p>However, both of their predictions were different.</p>
<p>「Gigigigyii! The girl! Bring out that divine artifact!」</p>
<p>「Hmm?」</p>
<p>What is it? A Divine Attribute? Are they after it?</p>
<p>「A divine artifact! This divine artifact is befitting of us!」</p>
