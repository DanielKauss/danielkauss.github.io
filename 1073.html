</div><h1>Chapter 1073</h1><p>「I’m not going to save you anymore...... Kafuh...」</p>
<p> Fran lying on the ground on the right, spit out a lot of blood. Even though Fran’s manifestation was lifted and she returned to being a human, the knife on her back was still the same. </p>
<p>「Frut! Maximum Heal!」</p>
<p> Fran uses healing magic on Fran, but the wounds are almost unhealed. The curse that flowed from the knife to Fran seemed to be blocking her recovery. However, Fran did not try to stop healing her. She used maximal heals many times already. She used maximal heals many times already.  </p>
<p>「It’s already impossible...  Fran!」</p>
<p>「That’s not impossible!」</p>
<p> Fran looked surprisingly calm, but her life force and magic power continued to decrease at a terrifying pace.  When I appraised her, I found that Fran was in a state of curse contamination.  I had never seen her before, but she was clearly not in a calm state. The ability to kill demons was given to a knife, and by any stretch of the imagination, it was a weapon that seemed to be aimed at Filurias’ demon users.  We tried to deactivate the curse and detoxify it, but it didn’t work.  When the divine attribute was applied, it only worked slightly, but it wasn’t a perfect curse. While using the spell, the curse only halved the speed at which it flowed.  Fran’s life force and magic power were constantly dwindling.  Was that because of what she said about demon killers?  From within Fran, lives were spilling down.  </p>
<p>「Maximum Heal!」</p>
<p>「Fran, listen to me.」</p>
<p>「...... Nn.」</p>
<p>  Fran pushed herself too hard to tell us the gist of the situation. It looked a little hard, but Fran didn’t want to stop her anymore, and she didn’t seem to have any intention of stopping Fran. What she learned was that Philias was also under attack by Raidos.  However, it was not a direct invasion by force, but a curse magic with a large-scale ritual. By using the flow of magic power known as the Dragon’s Bloodline, which ran through the earth, curses that made living creatures lose their power were spreading in a particular area of Philias.  People were losing their vitality and the fruits of their fields were being lost.  They were still in the early stages, but the damage seemed to be considerable. If the situation continues like this, the country might end up in trouble. </p>
<p>「Its origin is this village...」</p>
<p>「Its origin?」</p>
<p>「Yeah...  That...」</p>
<p>  Fran managed to move her trembling arm and pointed to the center of the plaza.  A huge magic stone was placed there.  </p>
<p>「It is sucking power from people... Maintains the curse technique......」</p>
<p>  So it was not the one that Fran and her friends had set up, but the magic stone that Raidos had set up!  In other words, the Raidos Kingdom conquered the area and activated the curse as a living magic cell. However, Filurias sensed it in some way, attacked them and took away the control of the village.  At first, they thought it was Kranzel’s work, and after analyzing the magic stones, they found out that it was set up by Raidos.  This was probably why Raidos heard about Kranzel and attacked her. They thought Kranzel was their enemy.  Besides, I think the fact that Fran and her friends went out of control was one of the reasons why Raidos went out of control and eliminated Fran.And I think that Fran’s party was one of the reasons why Rayus went out of control to eliminate Fran.  Whatever the reason is, they wanted to hide the fact that the royalty had invaded the border.  It was no wonder they thought that the life of every adventurer was the only thing they could do to protect the Kingdom of Philias.  </p>
<p>「Fran, run?」</p>
<p>「The half-dead Fran tells you the truth, while holding Fran’s hand. </p>
<p>「The curse will be fully activated.」</p>
<p>「What will happen if it is fully activated?」</p>
<p>「Not just our country, but this village is completely unscathed......」</p>
<p>  It seems that Fran and the others tried to use demon power to destroy the magic stones in order to prevent the full activation of the curse. However, even their power could not scratch the magic stones. In addition, the villagers and the magic stones were magically connected, so even if they were separated, magic power could not stop flowing.  It was not as if they were no matter how far away from us, since they were gathered in the square to prevent them from escaping. However, it seemed that they couldn’t escape from the magic stones by just leaving the village.  Fran’s words suggested that they would be activated soon enough. There was no time anymore to let the villagers escape.  </p>
<p>(Master?)</p>
<p>『I know.』</p>
<p>  Fran simply couldn’t escape.  She walked towards the magic stone and held her right hand in front of it. But nothing happened.  </p>
<p>「Hmm?」</p>
<p>『I knew it, I still couldn’t find it』</p>
<p>  I thought I could do something about it and tried to use the dimensional storage, but I couldn’t.  </p>
<p>「Hmph!」</p>
<p>『Doryaaaaah!』</p>
<p>「... It’s impossible」</p>
<p>『Yeah』</p>
<p>  Fran and I tried to lift it together, but it didn’t seem scary. It was not that it was simply too heavy to be lifted, but it seemed to be magically pinned in this place.  </p>
<p>「Then...  Haaa!」</p>
<p>  Fran slashed at the magic stone from above.  It was a reasonably sharp blow.  However, the magic stone did not even have a scratch. It seemed to boast a high defense not only against magic but also physical attacks. I actually remember this feeling.  </p>
<p>『Do you remember the magic stone weapon that Zelyse had set up to resurrect the great magic beast in the lake?』</p>
<p>(Nn.  It was tough)</p>
<p>『I think it’s the same as that. At the very least, it seems to have been strengthened in a very similar way』</p>
<p>  The flow of magic power was very similar and the smell was the same.  No, I don’t have a nose though.  I somehow feel the same way the processers work.  It was only my intuition, but I felt that Zelyse was involved in this as well. I don’t know if the magic sword Zelyse had newly created it or if Zelyse had made it before he died.  Anyway, it would be quite difficult to destroy it with the normal method. Well, if it were not for us, though.  After all, we’ve succeeded in destroying it once.  </p>
<p>(Don’t let the Raidos Kingdom do what it wants)</p>
<p>『Ou!</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
