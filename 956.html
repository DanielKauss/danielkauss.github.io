</div><h1>Chapter 956</h1><p>「Kill this old man!」</p>
<p>「Oji-san can’t even say he’s old, you know? He’s not quite that old yet.」</p>
<p>「Shut up!」</p>
<p> The dragonkin, who were unable to withstand Isario’s provokes, attacked us at once. Even Isario, who didn’t pull out Ignis, didn’t seem to be famous. They all attacked us without hesitation. At first glance, it was a pinch, but Isario shook his hand at Fran with a look of confidence. At first glance, it was a pinch, but Isario waved his hand at Fran with a relaxed look on his face.  Did he mean not to worry about it? No, don’t overdo it.  </p>
<p>『They might be working for the Dragon King. Let’s disable them and not kill them.』</p>
<p>(Got it.)</p>
<p>  Fran nodded lightly as she readied me, but many of the dragonkin were on their way to Isario. I guess they were angry at Isario for provoking them.  Fran restrained a few on her way and began to observe the battle on the other side. They didn’t even need to help, so they wanted to watch Isario’s battle up close.  Isario continued his defenses with Ignis just like when he was fighting antidemons. The sight of him smiling made the opponent even more irritated.  </p>
<p>「Die!  Die!」</p>
<p>「You’re not gonna let them beat up or make a fuss about it.  Young men use such strong words right away.  But it’s also boring to shout about what they can’t do, you know?」</p>
<p>「What the fuckwads!」</p>
<p>「Whoooa!」</p>
<p>  They may be considered small fry compared to Fran and Urushi, but they were still dragonkin to begin with.  They had high basic abilities and were stronger than lesser antidemons.  That’s probably why they got into a fight. Isario had completely thwarted all the dragonkin’s onslaught.  And so, the situation continued, making me wonder if they were being one-sidedly attacked, but in less than three minutes, the end came. One of the dragonkin suddenly collapsed and collapsed. </p>
<p>「G-Gah......?」</p>
<p>  He was breathing heavily, he was bewildered after not listening to what they were saying.  It was too early for him. The other dragonkin then collapsed as well and were unable to move.  It was the same as when I had put the thugs on. This time, however, I was able to detect the thugs so quickly because I had predicted what would happen.  Well, it’s simple though.  What we did was the same as the high-heating technique we had shown them in the antidemon battle. We increased the temperature inside their bodies and inflicted damage to them.  However, the difference this time was not so high as to cause a burn, but rather slightly lower than that.  They increased the temperature inside their bodies to deprive them of their strength. The dragonkin usually went on a rampage in a high-thermal state, so they ran out of strength in no time at all. The dragonkin probably didn’t notice the strange behavior either because they were angry and excited, and because their body heat increased little by little.  This time, they only increased their body heat, but if the air was heated, they could also burn their breathing organs and damage their eyeballs. At first glance, this was a more unobtrusive but terrifying strategy than controlling fire.  </p>
<p>「Did you notice it?」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>「Hahaha.  That’s what I’m talking about.  It’s kinda hard for uncles who use flames to catch them without hurting them. The result of a lot of trial and error」</p>
<p>  So, I guess it was Isario who controlled flames that created it when necessary. If I use Ignis’ flames, I’m sure they won’t be able to escape from the burns no matter how much I control it.  I bound the captured dragonkin and gathered them in one place.  I lost, but my heart still seemed to haven’t broken. All of them were staring at us.  </p>
<p>「Now then, you guys.  Can I ask you to tell me a few things?」</p>
<p>「Guh......  I have nothing to talk about!」</p>
<p>  They seem to have a lot of pride, so I guess they’ll ask them a normal question without hesitation. Fran stepped forward with me in preparation for the interrogation, but Isario lightly thrust his hand forward and stopped Fran.  He must have told her to leave the rest to him.  Fran clearly had enough killing intent to think that she was working for the Dragon King. She must have been worried about overkill, since Fran also obeyed Isario’s words. Fran also obeyed Isario’s words.  She stopped and nodded lightly.  </p>
<p>「Hahaha, don’t get that annoying!  Kill her!」</p>
<p>「Come on, uncle.  You must be impressed, aren’t you? No matter how many times your friends collapsed, you didn’t come here without fear?」</p>
<p>「It’s only natural if you’re a warrior.」</p>
<p>  Are they dragon warriors?  I thought they were just a bunch of failed thugs.  </p>
<p>「No, I’m sure you’re a dragonkin. They’re brave.」</p>
<p>「Hmph.  The dragonkin are a kin in battle.」</p>
<p>  The dragonkin leader’s chest twitched with annoyance. He was dexterous, even though he was tied up and forced to sit in the seiza pose.  But wasn’t he too timid for that?  Come to think of it, Isario was by far the strongest of the dragonkin.  They didn’t think anything bad would happen to him when he was praised by such an opponent. I’m sure these guys were very simple.  I guess after seeing how the dragonkin behaved, he decided that he could pull it off. Isario began to persuade them this and that.  </p>
<p>「I don’t want to kill these brave warriors if possible.  Can you be honest with me about something? That way, we won’t have to mess with them anymore.」</p>
<p>  Isario showed no signs of hostility, rather, he spoke to the dragonkin in a calm tone. The dragonkin seemed puzzled by Isario’s unexpected behavior.  </p>
<p>「I don’t know who you are, but it’s not your true intention to die here, right?  But, as I said before, we are the official researchers at the Adventurers Guild.  If we just allow anyone to be attacked, the guild itself will be underestimated.  That’s not what we can do. So, can you tell me what you’re after, even if it’s just for a little bit?」</p>
<p>「... I’m sure they’re going to kill us by letting us spit it all out anyway!」</p>
<p>「Don’t do that. But I wonder how their partner would answer that......」</p>
<p>  Isario glanced at Fran.  The dragonkin looked at Fran as if they were caught by her movements.  But the look on their faces seemed to say something about this girl.  They were clearly licking her. However, Isario shrugged his shoulders as if to see something terrifying, and toned his voice down as he spoke to the dragonkin.  </p>
<p>「That little lady hates the illegal slavers.  She’s a little excited after we got word that the dragonkin might be connected to the illegal slavers. That makes the interrogation a little harsher this time.」</p>
<p>  Then Isario looked at Fran again.  I could see that she was clearly aiming for nothing and nothing.  Isario was aiming for nothing, and Fran was aiming for nothing. So I let Fran utter a few words of intimidation.  </p>
<p>「I won’t forgive the black market slavers.  We’re blue cats.」</p>
<p>  Fran muttered a line while she was waving me at her, but the killing intent she unleashed was genuine.  The dragonkin must have sensed Fran’s seriousness too. Their faces were scrunched up.  </p>
<p>「You guys can’t have the kids messing around with you like they play around with you, right?  I know you’re pissed off.」</p>
<p>「Raw?」</p>
<p>「Raw......」</p>
<p>「Here.  I’ll make it in time for us now.」</p>
<p>「First, I’ll peel off all the scales and try to be smooth.」</p>
<p>「Uh-huh.  That’s terrifying.  So, what should we do?」</p>
<p>「S-If I talk, will you save us?」</p>
<p>「Sure.」</p>
<p>  Isario smirked with a disgusting look on his face.It crashed, huh?</p>
