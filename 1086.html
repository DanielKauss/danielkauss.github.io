</div><h1>Chapter 1086</h1><p>It may be small among the dragons, but it’s big enough compared to the other dragons. Diaz approached the mountain dragon at once. </p>
<p>「Guoooooh!」</p>
<p>「Is it the effect of summoning? You’re very motivated!」</p>
<p> The mountain dragon’s golden eyes narrowed as it glared at Diaz from the start. It should have been very intimidating, but Diaz was the one who gave it a blast. He rushed in a straight line to the mountain dragon and unleashed his magic. They rushed toward the mountain dragon in a straight line and fired their magic straight at it.  </p>
<p>「Hah!」</p>
<p>「Graoowl?」</p>
<p>  It was weak fire magic. The mountain dragon’s face looked puzzled, as if it didn’t expect such weak attacks to be delivered.  Then, it immediately began to look angry. He must have thought that it was just a little off.  </p>
<p>「Grrr!」</p>
<p>「Hahahaha! I can’t get a hit on it!」</p>
<p>「Grrrr!」</p>
<p>  The dragon slammed its thick paw at Diaz, but it dodged without any injuries. And sometimes he threw a counterattack. Well, all of them were terrifying.  For example, he could surprise them with his dragon illusions, or he could make a huge sound behind them. Even so, the dragon in front of us seemed to be getting caught by him in an interesting way, and every time he got angry with him.  That was probably because of Diaz’s good timing, his Thought Guidance, and Eye Guidance skills. Even if he doesn’t have a dramatic effect, if an old cunning person like Diaz can use him, even a dragon can mess with him.  Did Diaz keep on sucking at that giant dragon for almost five minutes?  At first glance, it may sound like he had leeway, but it’s a dangerous area for magic loss. He won’t be able to continue for another five minutes. In the midst of all this, the mountain dragon took a deep breath, probably because it had been fed up by the fact that it wouldn’t hit no matter how many times it attacked.  </p>
<p>「Lugaaaaagh!」</p>
<p>「It’s a shame!  That’s just an illusion!」</p>
<p>  It emitted a tremendous roar, making even Fran from a distance suffer. The mountain dragon apparently used a roar with excellent destructive power that took advantage of its huge body instead of not radiating a brace.  The earth was heavily gouged around the mountain dragon, and the remains were blown hundreds of meters away. Diaz, who was at the center of the blast, looked completely entangled, but that was not his real body.  He had swapped himself with a dummy made by illusion magic. He had built a wall of dirt more than 500 meters away, hiding in the shadows and roaring. Even we had doubts as to when this would happen, but a dragon in the mountains would not be able to understand.  However, he was completely furious at the sight of such a low-ranked bug.  Like a cow in front of us, he scratched the ground several times with his paws.  In fact, it was a signal of a rush. The dragons started to run toward Diaz, swinging through the earth.  The mountain dragons didn’t have wings, so they couldn’t fly in the sky, but they could run on four legs.  Their speed was terrifyingly fast. The mountain dragons were more than 100 meters long, so they were about 500 meters away.  They were approaching Diaz in a few steps. They were trying to blow Diaz away with their rush to destroy even the walls with a single blow.  Diaz fled in a somewhat panicked manner, but the mountain dragons followed Diaz with an surprisingly sharp turn. It seemed to have released its magic power and successfully bent its huge body.  But this was Diaz’s trap.  It seemed that what he was panicking about was an act. Immediately after Diaz smirked and looked nasty, the earth burst forth and a large number of things jumped out.  </p>
<p>「Binding of Ten Thousand Threads!」</p>
<p>「Grrrr?」</p>
<p>  In that place, the strings that Felmus had prepared for five minutes were hidden. As the name of the technique implied, tens of thousands of strings tangled around the dragon’s limbs, blocking its movement.  They were dealing with a mountain dragon, which boasted one of the highest power among all dragon species.  It must be impossible to restrain them completely. The strings quickly snapped apart.  However, they were caught in the middle of a forcibly turning, and that was a fatal imbalance. This was a fatal imbalance.  The mountain dragon lost its balance and fell to the side, chipping away at the ground.  </p>
<p>「Foul!  You better cry and suffer!」</p>
<p>  Eiworth was our chase after the mountain dragon, whose feet and face were covered with ice.  The ice on his face was reddish-purple. It must be specially made ice mixed with poison. In addition, the feet of the mountain dragons also froze, turning into an ice field.  The dragon’s face was covered with poison and ice, which made him feel half panicked. Then, he slipped and fell down again.  </p>
<p>「Uwahaaha! Young individuals should be able to wear them easily!」</p>
<p>  Is that the reason why he froze his feet?  The ice at his feet and the frozen ground under his feet made it impossible for the dragon to stand properly. It was probably because the ice on its face had taken over its vision, and they hadn’t noticed it.  So, the mountain dragon first began to struggle to deal with the ice on its face――.  </p>
<p>「Miss Hilt!  I strike you with a magic stone! Then, you put a big big hit on it!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p> The dragonkin didn’t miss the opportunity and started moving.  In his hand, he was holding not the hammer he had been using up until now, but a huge hammer with a pointed tip. Name: Dragon Punisher Attack Power: 1098 Mana Conductivity: 500 Durability: 10 Magic Conductivity: B+ Skills: Scale-penetrating, explosion, single-point focused, self-destructive, and very peeky!  A single-use weapon that penetrates through the dragon’s scales, but only broke once. Moreover, the backlash on the wielder can damage it.  It’s a too-pointed weapon that only a tough chewy guy can master. </p>
<p>「Dooooooooooaaaahhh!」</p>
<p>Magic Conductivity: B+ Skills: Scale Piercing, Explosion, One-point Concentration, Super Strength, and Super Strength! It penetrates through the dragon’s scales, but it only lasts for a moment. Moreover, the backlash on the wielder can damage the weapon. It’s a too-pointed weapon that only a tough Gumdo can master. </p>
<p>「Dooooooooooaaaahhh!」</p>
<p> A large jump made with a magic tool slammed a dragon puncher to the base of the dragon’s neck.</p>
