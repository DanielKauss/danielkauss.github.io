</div><h1>Chapter 991</h1><p>Looking up at the castle from the foot of the hill, we saw a blond-haired, blond-scaled dragonkin standing there. You could tell how well his face looked from here. I couldn’t sense any man’s mana from his appearance, because it was filled with the aura of the Abyss Eater. However, I could tell from his appearance that he was not just any ordinary man. </p>
<p>「Trismegistus?」</p>
<p>「That’s right. He may look meek at first glance, but don’t be fooled by his appearance」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p> Frederick didn’t even tell him how skilled he was. Even from a distance, I could see his malice. We could see his vigor from a distance.  He must be quite skilled.  All the adventurers who had stepped foot into the hill at Isario’s urging were reacting the same way. At first, they were shaken by the aura of the Abyss Eater, and then they noticed Trismegistus from Fran and Frederick’s gaze. This was the first time they had ever seen Trismegistus in person, and they looked surprised.  The Golden Dragonkin were not moving. He was staring at us as if he was telling us to get up quickly.  </p>
<p>「Isario, where do you want to go?」</p>
<p>「This is his castle. We shouldn’t ignore it.」</p>
<p>「But we don’t know where he is since we don’t want to be serious.」</p>
<p>  Frederick looked up at the golden dragonkin with a glare. Since he was skeptical of the connection between Trismegistus and the Dragon King, his eyes were probably a bit careless.  Trismegistus’ golden eyes showed no signs of hostility. </p>
<p>「...... Let’s go.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>  When all the adventurers had calmed down, Isario began to climb the stairs. Everyone was nervous.  I guess they were all swirling around in the face of the legendary sinner.  But without any traps that everyone would be wary of, the group climbed up the stairs.  </p>
<p>「Welcome. </p>
<p>「I’ll interrupt you.」</p>
<p>「It’s because of my liking.  This is the first time I’ve seen anyone but the disciple of the Red lotus blade and the priestess, isn’t it? My sinner Trismegistus.」</p>
<p>  He looks so important.  Well, isn’t it inevitable that he is a former king? But she didn’t feel sorry for taking the Divine Punishment.  Blond hair, blond eyes.  Her skin is pale as if she had nothing of blemishes. Not only the horns, but even the scales on the back of her hand and rice are shining like refined golden.  At first glance, she looked like a gentleman, but she was tall and had more muscles than I thought. When she stood there and looked like she was making a picture, I guess it was a word she used for such beings.He may look like a dandy man, but he’s taller and has more muscles than I thought.  I guess that’s a word he used against those kinds of beings.  Besides, it was said that he had the mentality of a monster, but it didn’t look so obvious to me.  What I understood was that he was ridiculously strong.  Not only was he skilled in martial arts, but the magic power that resided within him was quite high among the dragonkin I’ve seen so far.  He could do pretty well in either close or long range combat. It wouldn’t surprise me if he was a Rank A adventurer, or even higher, depending on his magic skills.  Come to think of it, dragonkin also had a strength-oriented side similar to beastmen. He was probably one of the strongest warriors in his kin. He was said to have been one of the world’s leading alchemists, so he must be a natural genius.  Fran was apparently caught by Trismegistus’ words.  </p>
<p>「My priestess’ younger brother?  Who is he?」</p>
<p>「Hmm......」</p>
<p>  Trismegistus’ golden eyes stared at Fran.  There was no sign of skill or magic. Nevertheless, I felt as if I could see through everything.  Fran felt this and was holding back.  She hadn’t been identified as an enemy, so she managed to hold herself back. But she seemed to be ready to help me at any moment.  </p>
<p>「This is my castle, and it does not belong to me. I’m not going to refuse anything that comes, but it’s not cool to be hiding, is it?」</p>
<p>「Woof?」</p>
<p>  What did he do? Just as Trismegistus looked down on Fran’s shadow, Urushi came up from the shadows with a bewildering shriek.  There was no doubt that Trismegistus had dragged Urushi out of the shadows. But I had no idea what he had done.  No magic, no skills, and even that was unknown. It seemed that he wasn’t even trying to attack him, he just wanted to know Urushi who was hiding.  </p>
<p>「Is he a wolf?」</p>
<p>  He nodded in satisfaction and immediately looked away.  </p>
<p>『Urushi, are you okay?  Do you know what you’ve done to him?』</p>
<p>(W-woof?)</p>
<p> As I thought, Urushi himself didn’t seem to know much about it. He’s so mysterious that he can’t even guess.  He’s already strong, but he’s immortal due to his mysterious power. Trismegistus’ danger level in me was raised to Rank S. I couldn’t sense his presence, but his gaze turned to Fran again.  </p>
<p>「Aah, I remember you asking a question.  Is the priestess’ younger brother an evil dragon―― No, a half evil dragonkin?  That’s who he is.  He’s terrifyingly evil, but I can’t forget his face. He’s Tilanaria’s younger brother, the priestess of the divine dragon of fire, right?」</p>
<p>「That’s right......  But did you remember me?」</p>
<p>  Frederick was strangely surprised. It seems that he didn’t expect what was in Trismegistus’ memories.  The other party was a legendary person, if only in a bad way. If such a being had recognized him, they would have to be surprised. Anyways, the fact that Frederick was the disciple of the priestess of the Fire Dragon God meant that he was Velmeria’s mother’s younger brother? </p>
<p>「Frederick, Velmeria, relatives?」</p>
<p>「I guess you could say that, but I’ve been half-evil dragonkin, so my name has been erased. And because of that, I’ve been the guardian of Velmeria.」</p>
<p>  Normally, he would have been a decent disciple of a priestess. However, because she became a half-evil dragonkin, she was unable to stay on this continent and was sent to the Kingdom of Kranzel as Velmeria’s escort.  There was always a subtle sense of discomfort in the relationship between the two, but that was not the case for a normal escort and their subjects. Well, I guess that’s not the case with a normal escort and their subjects.  </p>
<p>「...</p>
<p>「Hmm?  Come to think of it, Georg and the others brought Tilanaria and a girl with them, didn’t they?</p>
<p>「Hmm? Come to think of it, Georg and the others brought Tilanaria and a girl with them, didn’t they? If that’s the case, then there’s no doubt about it.」</p>
