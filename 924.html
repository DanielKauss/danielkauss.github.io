</div><h1>Chapter 924</h1><p>「I’ve got those eyes!」</p>
<p>Mea clutched her eyes and screamed. She never thought that she would be killed by the light of the Divine Sword... If the steel wolves hadn’t been blasting away at the surrounding antidemons, it might have been quite dangerous.</p>
<p>「G-Gugyah?」</p>
<p>Rindo――No, Rindovlm is also perplexed, isn’t he? He looked down on his master, who was screaming at his feet.</p>
<p>Yes, the Lyndovlm that appeared was very large, just like the legends said. It was probably nearly 100 meters long.</p>
<p>It was more than twice as powerful as the water dragon I had seen before. It also radiated a huge amount of power. When we encounter a dragon of this level, we would probably think of running away first.</p>
<p>Well, that dignity was ruined by her Lord though. She was vigorously defending her tail around Mea from all the antidemons that attacked her.</p>
<p>「Nnnn...... To think it was this bright! I knew it!」</p>
<p>「Grrrr」</p>
<p>「Nuh? B-Lind, huh? Fuhaha! Didn’t you have a brave look on your face!?」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Maybe it was an emotional scene, but why did she have such a strong Comedy Smelling Smelling Smelling!? Anyway, it was not the time to feel sorry for her now!</p>
<p>『Mea! The antidemons are our first priority!』</p>
<p>「Yeah! That’s right!」</p>
<p>Mea knew who I was, so it didn’t take much time to talk to me. Mea also regained her composure right away.</p>
<p>「Hmm. Five of them look strong, huh...? Lind, leave the antidemons around you to me! Annihilate the small fry!」</p>
<p>「Woooof!」</p>
<p>We took out the commander and Lind blocked the small fry from heading to the city. If push comes to shove, Lind’s role as a wall would be perfect.</p>
<p>「As our commander, don’t have any objections?」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「Of course!」</p>
<p>No one disagreed with Mea’s words. Her words had the dignity of a natural obedience. Perhaps the enhanced charisma was also strengthened by her words.</p>
<p>She also looked a little more intimidating than usual. Her hair was longer than that of Zefmate’s petty face. Her long zanbara hair looked just like that of her father, the Beast King. It was not only the length of her hair, but also the feel of it.</p>
<p>As one would expect from parent and child. Their fierce and violent atmosphere and belligerent smiles gave the impression that they were parent and child.</p>
<p>The current Mea was definitely a King.</p>
<p>「Well then, let’s go!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>And then, the five of them challenge the commander in front of them.</p>
<p>「This is my opponent!」</p>
<p>『As expected of Fran! I’ve chosen the most powerful one!』</p>
<p>(Master, use the wolves to make the small fry around us)</p>
<p>『Got it!』</p>
<p>What Fran chose as her opponent was the smallest individual with the highest magic power contained in it.</p>
<p>He was holding a sword in his hand. His entire body was smart, showing that he was clearly a swordsman type.</p>
<p>It was a crimson knight-type with three long horns. The three horns seemed to consider Fran an enemy as well, so they stepped forward and held their ground quietly.</p>
<p>The movements of the antidemons made it look as if a warrior was applying for a battle in front of a powerful enemy. Antidemons certainly didn’t have any personality, but they did have a certain amount of personality as their commander.</p>
<p>Fran and Urushi stared at each other.</p>
<p>「Urraaaah!」</p>
<p>「Shaaaaaah!」</p>
<p>Fran and the other B Rank adventurers rushed into the fray in an instant. They swung around blindingly fast and slashed at each other.</p>
<p>With that shockwave alone, the high-ranking antidemons around us were blown away.</p>
<p>I see, it was a light type, and its speed was terrifying. Moreover, it had high regenerative power. I could see the wounds that Fran had inflicted on it healed instantly.</p>
<p>If it hadn’t been for Sophie’s song, we would have had a hard time. Maybe we could have won against an opponent that didn’t know if we could even use Potential Release.</p>
<p>But now we could fight more than just equals.</p>
<p>It outmaneuvered even Fran in speed and swordsmanship, and its regeneration was now evenly matched. Even when it was cut by an antidemon’s sword, it could be regenerated in an instant.</p>
<p>And there was no point in comparing the weapons. After all, I’m currently performing so well that I was far too strong.</p>
<p>(Master, Evil Spirits. Are you okay?)</p>
<p>I knew it was powerful, but to think it was a failed divine sword!</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
<p>There was a slight hint of evil mixed in with the Divine Energy I was clad in. Fran seemed to be worried about my condition, but it was no problem at all. The evil energy was just a little too great, and the control over it was slightly lacking.</p>
<p>Normally, this would be a problem, but I have no negative effects of Evil Spirits. It was almost the same as when there was overflowing magic power. The current Fran could ignore this level of Evil Spirits at all, and this level of Evil Spirits really had no effect on me.</p>
<p>Evil and Divine Power. In addition to that, there were also effects of my Money-Style skill.</p>
<p>The Golden Devourer skill was a modified version of Overgrowth’s Golden Devourer skill.</p>
<p>Now that I have the ability to absorb power from antidemons, I have enhanced my antidemon capabilities. Even if I slay antidemons with this skill, I won’t turn them into antidemons like Nadia did. Thanks to that, I can use them with peace of mind.</p>
<p>「Shh! Szeeee!」</p>
<p>Fran, who was already so fast that she couldn’t even leave a shadow behind, accelerated even faster. She was probably completely used to the physical abilities that had been enhanced by the Divine Beast Transformation.</p>
<p>Moreover, it moved so fast that it looked like an instantaneous movement for a moment. Apparently, in its Divine Beast state, it could use the Black Lightning Roll at will.</p>
<p>Normally, she would be at a level that made it hard to tell how even she was moving. At such a suspicious speed, the blood gushing from Fran’s wounds turned into mist and disappeared into the air in an instant.</p>
<p>Fran had complete control over that speed. Not only did she have increased muscle strength, but her kinetic vision and space-based perception skills seemed to have been firmly enhanced.</p>
<p>The current Fran would be able to see everything around her slower without using time acceleration. I had to use time acceleration to reach her.</p>
<p>So, this was the world that the Rank S adventurers were watching, huh?</p>
<p>It was hard for even the current Fran to beat Ashwrath and Weena Rhyn. They were making full use of their own power. However, there was no doubt that they had one foot in their territory.</p>
<p>「Teyaa!」</p>
<p>「Shwiiiii!」</p>
<p>It was too fast. Even Fran, who was in a Divine Beast state, could see that her body was starting to scream.</p>
<p>This antidemon that was head-on with Fran was probably out of the norm. To see such a large number of such vicious antidemons...... It must be really dangerous to be in the antidemon season.</p>
<p>But no matter how fast or strong, they were no match for Fran. She had more and more times to see through and avoid the antidemons’ attacks.</p>
<p>Fran was clearly surpassing even the highest tier antidemons.</p>
<p>「Ruaaaaaaaah!」</p>
