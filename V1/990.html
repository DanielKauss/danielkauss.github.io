</div><h1>Chapter 990</h1><p>After seeing off Captain Hagane, who was withdrawing, Fran and her party were walking toward the center of the continent again.</p>
<p>She was wary of the attacks and moved very slowly. However, no antidemons or dragonkin she had feared appeared, approaching the destination so easily that she was stunned.</p>
<p>The survivors of the second unit were stunned to see the castle of Trismegistus. It had been getting more and more noisy as we got closer, but they seemed to be speechless right in front of us.</p>
<p>Isario was probably the only one stuck.</p>
<p>「What’s that?」</p>
<p>Even Fran was in a poked state. Her voice was filled with admiration and awe.</p>
<p>The scene was so bizarre that even Fran could feel fear from just looking at it.</p>
<p>It was a huge castle built to cover a small hill. It didn’t seem to be built on top of a hill, but rather that a hill was built into the castle. That was just how it looked.</p>
<p>The first wall of the city seemed to be completely surrounded by hills. It was probably one kilometer long and well over two kilometers long.</p>
<p>It was huge and majestic, befitting a former royal castle of the dragonkin who once ruled the continent of Gordisia.</p>
<p>It was a series of high and thick walls, with countless spires that seemed useless. The roofs were all blue and the walls were all white. Did they have golden window sills?</p>
<p>The magnificent castle had surprisingly retained its beauty. Trismegistus was the only one living in the castle, which should have been unkempt for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>And yet, there was no trace of dirt on the walls. They must have had some kind of magic spell to preserve their status.</p>
<p>However, Fran and the other adventurers were not surprised by the cleanliness of the castle.</p>
<p>Almost in the center of the castle, the biggest part that could be called the main castle. From there, strange things grew.</p>
<p>From a distance, it looked like a slightly unusual castle, but in reality, that was not the case. When we approached it, we found out that it was just something like a huge tree that grew through the roof of the castle.</p>
<p>The rugged gray surface and the branching of the upper half of the plant looked like a tree. However, there were no leaves, and the branches stretching toward the sky became translucent in the middle.</p>
<p>And eventually, it disappeared completely as if dissolving in the sky. That must be why it was difficult to detect it from a distance.</p>
<p>Isario and Frederick were calm down because they knew their current condition beforehand. In other words, it was not the strange occurrence that happened yesterday and today.</p>
<p>「That castle was the residence of Trismegistus and the source of the Abyss Eater. And the big tree here is the Abyss Eater itself」</p>
<p>「!! That tree?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. There’s the Abyss Eater’s core in the basement of the castle. The huge tree back is its body extending from over there. The reason it looked like it disappeared halfway through was that it had been turned into a half-spirit」</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the closer we got to the castle, the less we felt the presence of antidemons. It felt like we were close to it, or somewhere else. I didn’t know exactly where they were even if I searched for them, but it always felt like they were watching us.</p>
<p>I was still worried about what was going on, but I guess it was because the aura emitted by the Abyss Eater’s core covered the surroundings.</p>
<p>「We can’t detect any antidemons around here in advance. Everyone, be more careful than ever. Sometimes antidemons will suddenly start gushing up close.」</p>
<p>「Okay」</p>
<p>We tend to forget about living on this continent, but this place where we are now is actually inside the Abyss Eater.</p>
<p>Since it was a special being called the Half-Spiritform, it was invisible and difficult to detect its presence.</p>
<p>However, it was difficult to touch it, but it was not that there was no interference from the other side. That was the antidemons. The Abyss Eater created antidemons within itself and ate everything.</p>
<p>It was said that the source of it was that gray giant tree, the Modoki, and the nucleus that was at its root. There must be many antidemons that were created near the main body of the tree. I couldn’t see them close now, but we couldn’t let our guard down.</p>
<p>But if there is a nuclear weapon, wouldn’t we be able to defeat the Abyss Eater if we destroyed it?</p>
<p>Fran seemed to think the same way.</p>
<p>「It doesn’t crush its core?」</p>
<p>「I won’t crush it. It withstands even the highest output of a divine sword, and it can regenerate itself in no time.」</p>
<p>To my surprise, in the past, three divine sword users had cooperated to directly destroy the nucleus, and that had failed.</p>
<p>「Correct. Maybe they’re Alpha, Cristalos, and Eldrad? I’ve only heard a few words from Trismegistus personally, so I don’t know much about it.」</p>
<p>「You still couldn’t defeat it?」</p>
<p>「Yeah」</p>
<p>Several times before, Ignis, Berserk, and Gaia. I’ve seen the Divine Sword’s power wield in front of me. It was frustrating, but all of them had power befitting of being called Divine Swords.</p>
<p>If three Divine Swords of the same level work together, they wouldn’t be able to be destroyed? That’s ridiculous.</p>
<p>「It’s almost here. For some reason, I’m worried that no antidemons are seen around...... I’m sure antidemons would normally be swarming around here.」</p>
<p>Like I thought, antidemons were probably being controlled by someone else.</p>
<p>In the end, the second unit reached the foot of the hill where the castle was built without any interference.</p>
<p>Once we passed through the huge gate in front of us, it would be safe to say that it was in the arena anymore. As soon as I stepped foot into the hill while being wary, I could clearly see that the atmosphere had changed.</p>
<p>The gentle breeze for a moment. I could feel a refreshing feeling out of place, as if I was being bathed in the gentle breeze that blew through the clean forest.</p>
<p>It seemed they had passed through a barrier that had some kind of purification ability. Immediately afterward, Fran and a few adventurers who were right behind Isario stopped in a tight spot.</p>
<p>The adventurers who hadn’t crossed the barrier yet looked puzzled.</p>
<p>But I know how they feel. I’m in a similar situation after all.</p>
<p>「A-Abyss Eater?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, don’t worry. They won’t attack us from the other side around here. For some reason, antidemons don’t spring up in the castle」</p>
<p>The wards surrounding the hill were probably intended to push back the effects of the Abyss Eater. A tremendous aura, as if crushed, enveloped us.</p>
<p>Isario said that for some reason, antidemons do not spring up in the castle.</p>
<p>「...Actually, I was going to take a break until everyone got used to it. But I can’t just stand there when you’re greeted」</p>
<p>「You’re more than welcome?」</p>
<p>『Fran, it seems to be the entrance to the castle』</p>
<p>The Abyss Eater’s presence was so strong that I couldn’t detect it at all. Fran didn’t notice it either, but Isario and I have noticed her figure.</p>
<p>A beautiful blonde dragonkin man stood leisurely in front of the gate to the castle.</p>
<p>「You come too, Trismegistus.」</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>『This is Trismegistus!』</p>
