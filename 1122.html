</div><h1>Chapter 1122</h1><p>The sanctions on the valiant soldiers, who had put their weapons and killing intent into Fran’s hands, were only a matter of time. They were all sank in a single punch and then beaten to a pulp until Fran cried. Those who did not lose their rebellious spirit with a few hits were re-trained after they recovered. The fact that ten men were half-slayed with almost no counterattacks seemed to have completely taken away their will to disobey the valiant soldiers. This time, they were able to show clearly how their limbs were dropped and connected.The fact that ten men were half-slayed without any counterattacks seemed to indicate that they had completely taken away their will to disobey the soldiers.  This time, they had clearly shown how well they connected their limbs by dropping their limbs.  Some of them even tried to escape through the gap, but Urushi had stopped them.Some tried to escape through the gap, but they had been stopped by Urushi.  Blood was even more draining from the faces of the valiant soldiers when they heard the tremendous screams of the men who had been lifted in their mouths.  There was no blood coming from the men, but their teeth seemed to have been put more pressure on their backs.  They were in a large state to give them a sense of intimidation, but this seemed to have caused them to be a little off guard.  Both Fran and Urushi failed to hold back a little, but they must have been merciless to the valiant soldiers.Both Fran and Urushi only failed to hold back a little, but the brave soldiers must have seen them as merciless.  Moreover, they couldn’t help but feel fear when they realized that their mercilessness might be directed at them.  They were very calm and obedient.  However, there was a slight change in Fran.  </p>
<p>(Master)</p>
<p>『What’s wrong?』</p>
<p>(It might be the same for us if we keep running like this)</p>
<p>『Aah― , well, maybe that’s true』</p>
<p>(Well, I’ll tell you how to get it to run)</p>
<p>『Oooh!  That’s good!』</p>
<p>  Seeing the soldiers whose dissatisfaction exploded, he thought that just running them was not enough. He decided to tell them exactly what it meant to run the soldiers. He had grown up trying to properly explain his thoughts to others!  While I was impressed, Fran outmaneuvered the men and went to the front of the formation. The chase from behind was Urushi’s change. </p>
<p>「You guys don’t listen, smell, bother, steal, smell, and sound bad.」</p>
<p>  She said it two smelly times?  Well, Fran had a good nose, and I guess it was the important part. When Fran suddenly started dissolving them, the warriors in arms looked indescribable.  </p>
<p>「It’s useless to take you to the battlefield.  On the contrary, it would be a hindrance.  In its current state, you’re on par with goblins.  No.  Goblins can get magic stones, but you can’t get magic stones from you. If that’s the case, they’re no better than goblins」</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>  That’s quite what I’ve been told about, right?  However, the brave soldiers couldn’t go against Fran and continued to run.  </p>
<p>「If they can run properly with this training, they’ll be able to move from below the goblins to the goblins. So, do your best」</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>  Rather than dissent, they didn’t know how to react. Anyway, did they know that their evaluation of them was the lowest?  After that, I was being pushed by Fran so much that I felt a little sorry for them.  In addition to running, Fran shouted </p>
<p>「You’re no better than a goblin!  I’ll do my best!  If I don’t do my best, I’ll stay no better than a goblin!」</p>
<p>「So you’re no better than a goblin! We won’t be able to become a good goblin if we don’t do something!」</p>
<p>  She may be trying to motivate the brave soldiers from Fran’s point of view, but rather, her heart was broken.From Fran’s point of view, they were probably trying to energize the warriors, but rather, their hearts had been broken.  Well, I guess they were training the problem children, which was their original goal.  In the end, they continued to run in silence for about half a day, and the warriors sat down in the camp as if they were exhausted.  Because of their mental exhaustion, no one attempted to move. On the other hand, Fran was treating the warriors so gently that it was hard to imagine in the middle of the day.  </p>
<p>「Those below the goblins.  You better do your best.  They’re still less than the goblins, but you can eat this as a reward for your hard work.  I line up!」</p>
<p>  What Fran dished out to the surprisingly obedient warriors was curry. Each one of them handed curry to them.  I guess they were working hard for the brave soldiers in Fran’s own way.  It felt a little self-made, but some of the men were kind to Fran and were in tears.  So, they were easy on them. However, I must remember to tighten our guards.  </p>
<p>「Urushi will chase after you if you try to run away at night」</p>
<p>「Grr!」</p>
<p>「If Urushi doesn’t want to eat them, I’ll sleep quietly」</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Yes! Understood, captain!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>  Now they won’t run away, but instead, all guards at night were exempted.  Fran and Urushi decided to take turns. Mareficent and the others came up to us when the warriors, who had been flattened to eat curry, began to sleep to die. </p>
<p>「Uwaah, they were eating something delicious, weren’t they?」</p>
<p>「Nn.  Curry, the best food」</p>
<p>「It looks delicious」</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>  Persona then bowed her head in sync with Mareficent’s words. Seeing such a girl, Fran took out the curry again.  </p>
<p>「Do you want to eat it?」</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>  Persona stopped trying to take the curry.  Then she looked up at Mareficent. It was because of the mask that she didn’t see her face, but she was sure that she had a look of pleading. </p>
<p>「Yeah, but please don’t mess with your clothes」</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>  Persona nodded her head and ran with the curry above her head. Don’t be too careless.  </p>
<p>「Uwaah, thank you very much」</p>
<p>「I feel sorry for losing friends」</p>
<p>「I see」</p>
<p>  Apparently, Mareficent and Master didn’t want to remove the mask.  Just to do that, they must have their mouths wide open.  They started to eat alongside each other.  </p>
<p>「This is delicious! It’s the best!」</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p> Persona didn’t say anything, but with the speed of her spoon, she was sure she liked it.  After the meal was over, Mareficent and the others approached us again.  It seemed that it was not just to return the curry dish.</p>
<p>「I’d like to have a little talk with you about your next route」</p>
