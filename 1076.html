</div><h1>Chapter 1076</h1><p>Satya let go of her hand holding Fran, wiped her eyes and spoke about the future.</p>
<p>「Don’t you want us to be captured?」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>I hesitated. To be honest, even if we handed Fran over and let her go, the villagers would still look at us in various ways. If the country did serious research, they would probably find out about it.</p>
<p>But Fran shook her head in frustration.</p>
<p>「I’m not gonna catch them」</p>
<p>That’s what she said. If they wanted to capture her, they must have already taken action.</p>
<p>「I’m coming with you. In exchange, can I ask the life demon to take you back?」</p>
<p>「But then, both Fran and Satya will......」</p>
<p>「I can’t let my savior go. I’ll be fine, I’ll follow her from behind, so that the villagers don’t notice」</p>
<p>「......Are you sure? Don’t hide it?」</p>
<p>Oh! Fran, were you planning to hide it completely? That’s really nasty. I have to report to you to some extent, or you might be guilty of national rebellion!</p>
<p>「Now that I think about it, I wonder if that was Raidos’ aim.」</p>
<p>「Raidos’ aim?」</p>
<p>「Yes」</p>
<p>Satya told us about her own thoughts, but it was similar to my thoughts. After all, I had been wondering why she had performed a huge ritual until she took the trouble to occupier a village in the Kranzel Kingdom.</p>
<p>Because of the dragon’s pulse, they would only find this place if they told me that. However, the Kingdom of Philias was surrounded by Raidos. Wouldn’t it be enough to have a stronger curse on the Raidos Kingdom’s side?</p>
<p>I don’t know the details, but I think there was another reason for this besides the use of curses.</p>
<p>「I think Raydoss is not just aiming for the completion of the curse.」</p>
<p>「What do you mean?」</p>
<p>This would be fine as long as the curse was completed. We would be able to inflict a blow on the Kingdom of Philias.</p>
<p>However, the Kingdom of Raidos had planned to be stopped by the Kingdom of Philias, I suppose?</p>
<p>If they wanted to activate the curse, they could simply massacre the villagers, adventurers, and bandits they had gathered in the square and make a sacrifice. Satya felt that the Raidos Kingdom had purposely taken advantage of the people.</p>
<p>In other words, the Kingdom of Philias was aiming to attack a village on the Kingdom of Kranzel’s side to stop the activation of the curse.</p>
<p>「Our demon knights are a little too loyal to our country after all...」</p>
<p>Some of them might even want to kill people from other countries without hesitation in order to save the people of the Kingdom of Philias. Some say that high loyalty can be distorted by the effects of the demons they possessed.</p>
<p>The demons had properties on par with the Seven Great Evils, but Philias apparently gave priority to demons of lust and arrogance. That was because they were easier to use as subordinates.</p>
<p>I’m sure both Bune and Ronowe were demons from the legends of King Heromon... But are they one of the Seven Sinners?</p>
<p>Well, I guess this world was created by the Gods based on Earth, and it was a mixture of various legends. From the Gods’ point of view, it was a mixture of the various Gods’ power from Earth.</p>
<p>「Arrogance, if you don’t change your direction, it will lead to hard work. Because I have a desire to be perfect」</p>
<p>In order to look down on others, you need to enhance yourself. That trait is useful in our work. We can use lust as long as the opposite sex is not intertwined, and Phyllius seemed to have a technique to suppress that trait.</p>
<p>It seems she’s more likely to listen to us than to be lazy or angry.</p>
<p>The two whom we had brought this time and the Seridot of the servant we had met before were said to be possessed by an arrogant demon. When I thought back, I was convinced. Because they looked down on others, there was a danger that everything could happen. This was definitely the cause of Phyllius’ poor diplomacy.</p>
<p>Even if only the demon knights, not Fran and Urushi, had been dispatched, they would have decided to slaughter them in the first place. If Kranzel was informed of this fact in some way, the two countries would be in a jerk.</p>
<p>「This was a move to tear the two countries apart. I think so」</p>
<p>「Then it’s better to hide it」</p>
<p>「No, we will lose the trust of the Kranzel Kingdom when it is revealed later. The Raidos Kingdom will definitely try to make it known」</p>
<p>「I see」</p>
<p>I don’t know if that really was what the Raidos Kingdom was aiming for. However, if Satya were to apologize and report to Kranzel, there was a high possibility that they wouldn’t make the decision to open their front against Philias. That King was the type who moved more rationally than emotionally.</p>
<p>「Please take me with you too」</p>
<p>「...Okay」</p>
<p>Fran nodded in distress, but unexpectedly, Satya braced herself. She sensed the presence of someone approaching at a tremendous speed. But Fran smiled to reassure Satya.</p>
<p>「Don’t worry, I’m not your enemy」</p>
<p>Immediately after Fran said that, a black huge body appeared from across the forest.</p>
<p>「Arf.」</p>
<p>「Urushi! That guy from earlier?」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>It was Urushi who had just returned. He had a unconscious man in his mouth. He was ready to bite to death at any time when he was about to run away. He had skillfully captured the agent.</p>
<p>However, Urushi was also quite exhausted. His magic power was less than half, and his life force was still decreasing. When I paid closer attention, I saw that there was a small knife stuck in Urushi’s right stomach.</p>
<p>No, it would look small because of Urushi’s huge body, but it would be the same as a knife that took Fult’s life. Even without the effect of killing demons, the curse would work on Urushi as well.</p>
<p>「Urushi! Are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Arf.」</p>
<p>『Wait, I’ll put you at ease right away』</p>
<p>Fran slashed at the knife used to kill the demon and let me absorb it. The wounds, which were slow to regenerate due to the curse, were quickly healed by continuous healing magic with the Divine Attribute. If I can use the cure, the curses in my body will disappear cleanly.</p>
<p>Did the man who was bitten by Urushi make a dull sound? The vibrations from slashing at the knife caused intense pain, which seemed to have put a little more strength into it. The bone may have been broken, but I’ll let it continue. The man has pain nullification too.</p>
<p>『What was that guy’s face like?』</p>
<p>「Arf.」</p>
<p>『Yeah. Did you change your face when you were in the village because of illusion magic and disguise?』</p>
<p>「Arf.」</p>
<p>Urushi nodded and slew the man down. He had lost one of his legs, but he had already stopped bleeding. He must have covered his wounds with the potions that Urushi had brought with him.</p>
<p>「Oi, get up」</p>
<p>「Hmm...? Tch...」</p>
<p>『Oh! Poison!』</p>
<p>The man who woke up immediately seemed to have grasped his situation. He drank the poison in his teeth. However, Urushi immediately used deadly poison magic to nullify the man’s poison.</p>
<p>Realizing that he was not dead, the man remained silent and motionless. Due to my pain nullification, he was not responding to any pain.</p>
<p>Fran tried her best to heal her by hurting her, but it didn’t work on a man.</p>
<p>「What about this man?」</p>
<p>「......I’m the one who threw the knife at Fran.」</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>Fran hesitated a little, but soon she learned what it was. Immediately after, Satya’s presence changed. To think she could unleash such a dense and vicious killing intent in such an instant......</p>
<p>Fran and Urushi were frozen. It was not the kind of situation that Fran was afraid of, one that made her cry half-crazed. No, maybe it was even more terrifying.</p>
<p>「...So this is the place, huh?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Even I felt a chill the moment Satya said 「This」.</p>
<p>「Hey, Fran-san. Can you let me interrogate you? I’ll definitely let you open your mouth no matter what you try. What do you think?」</p>
<p>「I-I think that’s a good idea. Right? Urushi?」</p>
<p>「W-Woof woof!」</p>
<p>That Fran and Urushi were a little scared of her. That’s how powerful the Satya was right now. The man also looked up at Satya with a thin smile and twisted his face with fear.</p>
<p>I think it was in our best interest for us to beat them all up as soon as possible, right?</p>
