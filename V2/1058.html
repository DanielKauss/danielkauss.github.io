</div><h1>Chapter 1058</h1><p>The day after we destroyed Barbra’s Raidos fleet, we were heading north along the coast for Dars. There were some fishing villages along the way, but they were not even aware of the occurrence. They seemed to have been a little suspicious of the fact that no merchant would come to buy fish in the fishing village closest to Barbra. However, as we went further north, they were living their normal lives, not knowing that the Raidos Kingdom had begun its invasion. However, as we went further north, they lived their normal lives, not knowing that the invasion by the Raidos Kingdom had begun.However, further north, they lived their usual lives, not knowing that the invasion by the Raidos Kingdom had begun.  The Raidos Kingdom’s fleet must have used a route that was not found by the residents of the fishing villages to prevent them from being caught by the anomaly.  They were only in a port town a little larger than the village, and they were finally receiving information about the anomaly and starting to move to prepare for it. It would take some time for the information to reach the surrounding fishing villages. Well, I’ve told them that Barbra had been attacked by each fishing village, so I’m sure they’re now sending their messengers to the town.  From there, we traced further along the coast and came closer to the port town of Dards. As one would expect from a fishing village right next to Dards, we had noticed something strange and were able to get a lot of information from them.  Dards was originally close to the Raidos Kingdom, so he seemed to have prepared himself for it. Immediately after the defense fleet was defeated, messengers were sent to the surrounding villages to order them to evacuate.  Many people had already evacuated to the inland towns.  Still, the old people who refused to evacuate were the ones who remained in the village. They told Fran that it was ridiculous to abandon the village and run away, and she didn’t ask them to evacuate.  On the contrary, she was worried about Fran going to Dars and gave them some potions.  </p>
<p>『Fran.  What’s wrong?』</p>
<p>「...I wonder are those old men okay?」</p>
<p>『It seems they have food to eat, but I guess they’ll be in trouble if Raydoss soldiers come』</p>
<p>  If Fran was so concerned about her, why didn’t they have to push themselves too hard and bring her to the town? But when asked whether they didn’t want to leave the village or not.  Even if they were forced to rescue them, they might just lose their lives and live a carefree life.  Is that what makes them happy? But it was better than dying?  It was a difficult problem. However, Fran seemed to have decided to respect their will. </p>
<p>「Dars, he said that they’ve already been occupied」</p>
<p>『Well, I don’t know what can I do if the fleet is destroyed.  There are only a few adventurers after all』</p>
<p>「Is Charlotte and the others okay?」</p>
<p>『It seems that we’ve managed to get quite a lot of people out of there, and all we have to do is to get inside』</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>  However, in this case, Charlotte and the others were going to Dars as a representative of Barbra. If they were asked to cooperate in the defense, they would not be able to refuse. It was highly likely that they were participating in the battle with the Raidos Kingdom.  </p>
<p>「First, we’ll check what’s going on in the town」</p>
<p>『Yeah. When we’re going to report to a nearby town, we need to check the size of our enemy fleet and the number of soldiers we have.』</p>
<p>  It would be better to wait for the night to actually, but that would make it difficult to check the enemy’s troops. There were some risks, but for the time being, we decided to scout out Dars from the sky.  We ascended at once and headed for Dars. Urushi’s black body looks conspicuous on the sunny sky, so he must have been disguised properly, remember?  While using illusion magic to project the sky around him, I also used light magic camouflage to blend in with the surrounding scenery.  It was not completely transparent, but I was sure that his disguise was enough to be called a simple optical camouflage. If we hadn’t stared at the sky so carefully, we shouldn’t have been able to detect it.  However...  </p>
<p>「Kyuiiii!」</p>
<p>「Kyuiiii!」</p>
<p>「Lots of big fry!」</p>
<p>『lesser lock!』</p>
<p> Three giant beasts were flying around us. They were about two meters long and their wings were about ten meters long.  They were a magic beast with a threat level of D, the Lesser lock.  It was not that powerful, but it seems to be so good at detection that it could see through our disguise.  They were probably using it by the Raidos Kingdom.  Anyway, once it was discovered, it would be difficult to hide anymore. In the first place, it had been found on the ground because these guys were surrounding us.  </p>
<p>「I’m sorry, Master」</p>
<p>『Well, it can’t be helped then!  Don’t worry about it! More importantly, we’ll take them down!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  In fact, we had witnessed our acquaintances being taken away while we were scouting from the sky. About 30 adventurers were being led through the town of Dars, where soldiers and adventurers had been left dead everywhere.  Apparently, they were in the middle of being transported from the harbor to a ship. The leader of the line had already stepped foot into the harbor.  Among them were Judith, Maia, and Lydia, the Scarlet Maidens.  Also, there were also half-insectkin Eugene.  They were all covered with wounds and shackles. Besides, they were being scolded from behind for being a little slower to walk.  Fran had witnessed this and unintentionally unleashed her killing intent. As a result, they were discovered by Lesser locks and the others who were wary of the sky.  It was only for a moment though. They were used for security because their detection ability was so high that they could notice it.  </p>
<p>『Urushi!  I’ll leave this one in the back!』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「I’ll do the right one!」</p>
<p>『Then I’ll be the left one!』</p>
<p>  We broke the concealment and attacked Lesser Rock. It was a rather troublesome opponent that was big and fast, but he was not our enemy now.  The match was over in an instant. Urushi’s fangs pierced his head, and Fran’s slash and my thunder magic killed each of the opponents we were aiming for.  But the problem came after this.  They looked down at us while storing the corpse of Lesser rock. The harbor was packed with Raidos soldiers, trying to save everyone.  </p>
<p>『What should we do?  Retreat for now and get back in at night?  We’ve found them completely』</p>
<p>(Then maybe they’ll take us somewhere! Let’s help them now!)</p>
<p>『Wha, Fran!  Could it be, you want to plunge into the harbor!?』</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
<p> There’s a lot of Raidos soldiers in the harbor right now! Are you going to plunge into there!?  </p>
<p>『Just answer Gamud said don’t be reckless and he’ll be okay!』</p>
<p>「Nn! I’ll blow away all the enemies, so don’t worry!」</p>
<p>『What do you mean by that!?』</p>
<p> He didn’t care so much about Fran’s hostility towards Raidos!  </p>
<p>『... Haah.  It can’t be helped.  But we can’t just rush in and fight recklessly. We need to be prepared for our strategy』</p>
<p>  Even if we hide ourselves and wait for the night, things won’t get any better.  In fact, it would be quite difficult to rescue a large number of people from the ship. If that was the case, now that we know what we’re trying to do, it might be better to force her to help.  After all, there are advantages and disadvantages to which one to choose. If that was the case, it might be better for us to fight here because we could maintain Fran’s motivation.</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
