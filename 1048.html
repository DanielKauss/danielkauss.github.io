</div><h1>Chapter 1048</h1><p>The ship was being chased by the fleet of the Kingdom of Raidos and changed its path to the Kingdom of Kranzel. However, we were also in an unexpected situation. </p>
<p>『Oi oi! Barbra is burning!』</p>
<p>「That’s the water dragonkin!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p> The magic hand of the Kingdom of Raidos was also reaching Barbra, where we had finally arrived. Fire hands and black smoke rose from the ports and towns, and I could see that there had been considerable damage. Ships from the Kingdom of Raidos and the Sea of Seedran were lined up at sea, and magic shots were being conducted. Ships from the Kingdom of Raydoss and the Kingdom of Seedran were lined up at the sea, and they were bombarded with magic.  Moreover, a familiar chain extending from a large battle ship to the sea in front of them. There should be a water dragon connected to the other side. Yes, it was not just the Raidos Kingdom’s army that attacked Barbra, but a joint fleet with Seedran, which was equipped with a water dragonkin.  </p>
<p>「Crap!  Change your path before you find us!  The north is impossible! We’ll head south again!」</p>
<p>「If we don’t choose the destination for our call...」</p>
<p> Of course, Brunen and the others wouldn’t rush into the fleet. There was no way they could win, and they had no obligation to do so.  </p>
<p>「... Brunnen. My contract is already over」</p>
<p>「... Don’t tell me, young miss...!  Are you going to go there?」</p>
<p>「I have a lot of people I know in Barbra」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  But that would be a problem for Fran.  There was no way Fran could overlook that. As for me, I feel it’d be better to keep avoiding Brunen and the others, and I’d be happy to keep the contract as a shield.  However, Brunnen was a man who understood what we were talking about.  </p>
<p>「... We can’t do this, you know? We can’t intervene in conflicts between countries without instructions from our home countries」</p>
<p>「I know」</p>
<p> Brunnen shook his head in frustration, as if he understood Fran’s firm will.  </p>
<p>「... I wish you good luck, Fran」</p>
<p>「Nn.  Thanks. See ya!」</p>
<p>「Fran!  Let’s meet again!」</p>
<p>「Fran!  I’ll leave the rest to you!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  Hilt and Colbert looked stern as well.  Because of their personality, they hesitated to escape here. Especially for Colbert, who was one of the base of their operations.  However, they have a contract with Brunen and they couldn’t abandon this ship. In the end, all they could do was to support Fran.  </p>
<p>「Miss Hilt! Do your best!」</p>
<p>「Uni, it was delicious!」</p>
<p>「Another one, huh!?」</p>
<p> Fran nodded back at the crew’s cheers and climbed up on Urushi.  </p>
<p>「Urushi, full speed.  But don’t let him find us」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  Urushi ran up to the limit and covered Fran and himself with dark magic. With this, he wouldn’t even know anything out of place unless he was an opponent with excellent detection abilities. Urushi, who had run a little slower so that his technique could not be broken, arrived in the sky above Barbra over a period of about 100 minutes.  Looking down, the allied fleets of Raydoss and Seedran were continuing to shoot. People were rushing to the gate on the opposite side of the port to evacuate out of town.  The castle, which should have been an evacuation center, had been left ruined by the bombardment.  holes had been drilled in various parts of the castle, and the spire had collapsed. The fire was starting to go around, and in a few hours, it would be completely useless.  They were currently filled with nobles different from the former lord, the Kraiston family, but are they safe? If the chain of command was in a mess, the evacuation would also be affected.  The adventurers have also fled. Aside from those who landed, it would be difficult to counterattack from the sea.  However, there were dozens of people who were frozen in place.  They were the soldiers’ quarters on the main street. I don’t know who they were, but they were probably planning to buy time for the civilians to escape when the enemy landed.  However, the shots landed a few times, and the buildings were about to collapse soon.  </p>
<p>「Let’s stop the attack.」</p>
<p>『Well, that’s the quickest way』</p>
<p>「What do we do?」</p>
<p>『Now that you mention it...』</p>
<p>  It would take a while to sink all the more than a hundred ships. If that was the case, we would have to destroy the chain of command by targeting the flagship.  There was only one opponent we could target.  </p>
<p>『Let’s attack the water dragonkin with everything we’ve got!』</p>
<p>「Okay!」</p>
<p>  Now that we hadn’t been found yet, we could unleash the best blow with our power accumulated to the limit. That would sink the water dragonkin and reduce the number of confused enemies.  That would be the easiest way to do this. The problem was whether we could sink the water dragonkin with a single blow.  As it called itself the strongest battle ship, that ship was loaded with magic tools to strengthen the water dragon. In the past, we couldn’t break through its defenses.  Moreover, its magic power was on a different level from the water dragonkin we had seen before. If it was a new ship, it would probably have increased its defense power. </p>
<p>「But still, we have to do it」</p>
<p>『You’re right』</p>
<p>  Now we just have to trust our power and put all our strength into it. Just as the other side is getting stronger, we’ve grown a lot.  </p>
<p>「I’m sure we can do it」</p>
<p>『Ou!』</p>
<p>「Urushi will cover you!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  First, Urushi activated his magic.  A countless jet-black spears were created and poured down on the water dragonkin. Any normal ship would be covered with holes by this.  However, all the black spears were blocked by a thin layer of light.  It looked like a normal barrier rather than water magic on water dragons. It seemed that their defenses were even greater than those of the old type.  However, they were not expected to be able to prevent Urushi’s first blow. In fact, the purpose was to scatter the defenses by purposely blocking a wide area attack. While a dome-shaped barrier was stretched to cover the water dragonkin, Fran and I activated our follow up strike.  </p>
<p>「Haaaa!  Kanna Kamui!」</p>
<p>『Eat this!  multi-layered Kanna Kamui!』</p>
<p>  The reason why they used magic instead of slashes was because they chose the one that had a greater influence after use. The combination of Heaven Judgement and the Black Lightning God’s Claw definitely had an enormous impact power.  However, the range was narrow.  Only one of them, a water dragon ship or a water dragon, would be able to target it.  Compared to that, thunder magic had a much wider range and could even influence the other ships through the sea. When there were many enemies, it meant that Inazom was more convenient than Mezzolma.  A bunch of white lightning released from the sky was intertwined in the air and rained on the water dragon ship. It was not only fired at the same time, but it was calculated to be more powerful.  It was a possible feat thanks to the information processing skills I had acquired in Gordicia and the Great Wizard. We managed to get more than 10,000 magic power from this one-shot, but it’s okay.  It was worth that much.  Lightning raging like an angry Heavenly Dragon shot a flash of light against the Water Dragonkin’s barrier. I saw the barrier beginning to collapse.  We were about to put more magic power into it as we continued to maintain our release.  </p>
<p>「ikee!」</p>
<p>『Orraaaa!』</p>
