</div><h1>Chapter 1141</h1><p>「He’s dead!」</p>
<p>I wanted to know a lot of things, but there was no way he would ask. Roanes, the leader of the Crimson Flame Knights, pointed his muzzle at us and attacked us without a question.</p>
<p>I thought he was using flame magic, but it seems that ray-like sniping was blocked by Khanne Flame’s barrage. However, my attacks were blocked by Maphist and Persona.</p>
<p>「This is what I think about your filthy curses!」</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>「...Damn!」</p>
<p>Oops, he’s so nasty despite being a beautiful young man!</p>
<p>「What the hell is that thing?」</p>
<p>『Such a barrage now!』</p>
<p>Fireballs scattered around like a shot gun. Each shot was probably quite powerful. However, I couldn’t break the barrier that Fran, I, Mareficent, and Persona were working together to create.</p>
<p>『First, I’ll render him powerless! Urushi!』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「I know, I know!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>He seemed to have perfected his sense of when Urushi would jump out of the shadows. He shouldn’t have been able to sense very well... But, was he strengthened by some kind of treasure?</p>
<p>Urushi, who had canceled out the barrage with his right leg, crossed the shadows and came back. He seemed to have quickly clothed his prepared dark emblem on his leg, but still could not prevent it. The fur on Urushi’s right paw was greatly scorched and badly burned.</p>
<p>This technique of his was probably a proof that a single barrage was as powerful as high-level magic.</p>
<p>However, Fran still had the advantage over Numerae in numbers. She slashed at Roanes, who was able to recover from an attack of Urushi in an instant.</p>
<p>「Don’t stop! You little brat!」</p>
<p>「Taaah!」</p>
<p>「That was a lot of fun!」</p>
<p>Even if I blocked Fran’s attack with my treasured item, it didn’t even leave a scratch on it. The treasured item was really tough! It was not covered with Divine Power, but Fran was serious!</p>
<p>Moreover, he ignited only a part of his body to avoid the barrage of blows. So, the trump card of the Kingdom of Raidos was no fluke!</p>
<p>But that didn’t change the fact that she was at a disadvantage. After realizing that we were stronger than she had expected, Roanne’s face contorted in anger.</p>
<p>「Shit! Shit shit shit shit! I’ll definitely kill those shitty bastards!」</p>
<p>「Mrgh.」</p>
<p>My treasure has been transformed! Just as I was about to open a slit with a cracking sound, several metal cords came out of it. The thin cords wriggled like tentacles and wrapped around Roanes’s arm.</p>
<p>I could see through the cord that Roanes’ magic power flowed into the treasured item. The shell of the cannon shone in red.</p>
<p>But because of this transformation, Roanes had plenty of openings. Fran didn’t miss it and attacked.</p>
<p>「Haaaaah!」</p>
<p>『CONSUME ALL!』</p>
<p>I could feel that my blade was slightly enveloped in Divine Attribute magic power. I’m getting better at making full use of the blessings of the Beast and Insect Gods.</p>
<p>This Divine-Speed Sword Drawing Technique was imbued with divine energy.</p>
<p>It was Fran’s all-out blow, capable of firing without the use of Sword God Transformation or Potential Release, and also effective against the strong.</p>
<p>「Don’t underestimate me, kid!」</p>
<p>It seemed that Roanes had sensed the Divine Power of the Great Magic Beast. He didn’t even try to slip through it with Flame Form but instead stuck out his free left arm.</p>
<p>It collided with Roanne’s arm, cloaked in magic power, and my trajectory was slightly off. I guess she didn’t have any intention of blocking me from the beginning, but intended to parry and avoid fatal wounds.</p>
<p>She had intended to cut off Fran’s head, but she only managed to cut off half of the head by slashing away at the tip of her left elbow. No, that was still plenty of damage.</p>
<p>The wound caused by the divine attribute slowed down his regeneration. However, Roanes must have been prepared for that. Without stopping his movements at all, he thrust out his carmin Flame at Fran while staring at her.</p>
<p>「Shit!」</p>
<p>Filuria gasped for blood from her mouth as she shouted those words filled with killing intent.</p>
<p>『This is bad! Fran! I’ll give it everything I’ve got!』</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>The ability of the Kingdom Inflation Im, which I couldn’t see before.■■■ Now I can see the part of it with 『Divine Flame pump』</p>
<p>It was not that it was hidden, but it seemed that it could no longer be used under normal circumstances. After sucking in the user’s magic power――no, that’s not all. Magic power, vitality, and bad life expectancy, it seems that it could finally be used.</p>
<p>Divine Flame. In other words, it might be an attack on par with Isario. There was no way we could underestimate him.</p>
<p>I fired a lightning spell to check on him, but it all slipped through Roanes’ body. It must be from his use of fire magic again! The wounds on his neck were supposed to be fatal, but his ability to judge them seemed to have remained dull.</p>
<p>「Bhaah!」</p>
<p>Wasn’t that aimed at Fran?</p>
<p>Roanes pointed his muzzle at the sky and shot out a bright red bullet to the sky. No, maybe everyone here was aiming for it!</p>
<p>The bullets of divine flames burst like fireworks and went straight towards the roof of the fort. Hundreds of divine flames rained down on us.</p>
<p>『Malfiscent! Persona! Gather around Fran’s side! Everyone can block it!』</p>
<p>「Let’s go to Persona!」</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>The reason I called out to Mareficent and the others in my own way was not to try to protect them. It was because I realized that I wouldn’t be able to survive this rain of divine flames without everyone’s help.</p>
<p>At the very least, I couldn’t say that Fran and I would be able to overcome it on our own.</p>
<p>Both Murphyscent and Persona must have decided that too. They immediately started moving without questioning us.</p>
<p>『Urushi and Avenger will put up barriers as well!』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Understood! My God!」</p>
<p>She wasn’t a God!</p>
