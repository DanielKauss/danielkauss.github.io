</div><h1>Chapter 958</h1><p>A huge, life-like being suddenly appeared from under the ground. However, we still didn’t have a full picture of it. Perhaps due to the dryness of the entire continent of Gordicia, the dust was dense and did not clear up easily. However, it faded somewhat, revealing the true identity of the shadow. There was a huge antidemon in front of us. It was probably very similar to the swordsman-type. It was huge in size, but... However, it looked strange. However, it looked strange.  The huge antidemon was sitting with his knees in his arms.  It was as if he was sitting in a gym. Moreover, a strange liquid that could sense stickiness covered its surroundings.  It looked like a baby protected by amniotic fluid in the womb.  No, was it really an antidemon baby? It felt incomplete, but...  </p>
<p>「Isario, what’s that?」</p>
<p>「Uncle doesn’t know it either.  This is the first time I’ve ever seen a such a big antidemon. So, I’m sure no one has ever seen one of those kinds of antidemons in my past files.」</p>
<p>  So, this must mean that they’re a super-sized antidemon that you’ve never seen before. It has finally been proved that the season of antidemons is not proper.  </p>
<p>「What do we do?」</p>
<p>「Of course, that’s only going to destroy the antidemons.  Is that the only way?」</p>
<p>「Nn!  Okay!」</p>
<p>  Wait, wait!  How easy it is!  Don’t be afraid of attacking them to wake them up―― No way. With us are Rank S adventurers who use the divine sword.  If this man can’t be defeated, no matter who does it, he won’t be able to defeat them. In the first place, I couldn’t imagine any being that Isario had decided to defeat and couldn’t defeat.  Isario had said that he was going to “destroy”.  If that was the case, annihilate them. The envious father in front of us was that simple no matter what he said.  </p>
<p>『Fran, I’m gonna make sure I don’t get caught up in Isario’s seriousness!』</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
<p>  Fran must have believed Isario as well. He nodded his head in agreement with my words.  </p>
<p>「First, we need to get to him.  We’ll need some info before we defeat him.」</p>
<p>「Okay. Urushi, let’s go」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  As soon as Fran jumped on Urushi again, Isario activated his magic tool board.  </p>
<p>「Let’s do our best. Can you help us?」</p>
<p>「Urushi.  You shouldn’t lose」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>  The magic tools of Urushi and Isario advanced through the dust, which still seemed to be a thin mist. I thought that Isario’s magic tool wouldn’t be very fast, but now it was running at the same speed as Urushi’s.  Flames were gushing out from the back of the board floating in the air, creating a tremendous acceleration. They must have springed up at once.  The dust gave me a full view of the lake, but I could tell that it was over a thousand by their presence alone.  Moreover, the wave of magic power had not subsided. It seemed that even more antidemons would spring up in the future.  </p>
<p>「Let’s kick them out for now, shall we?」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  The antidemons that appeared were mostly high-ranked black antidemons. I thought there were only a few of them, but they were probably quite powerful. However, in front of Isario, they were no different from low-ranking antidemons.  Each time he wielded Ignis, a wave of flames was created and swallowed the antidemons around him.  At first, we slowed down a little, but we quickly returned to our full speed. We pushed forward with a jerk while defeating only the antidemons in front of us. Without Fran and Urushi’s warning, we went through the antidemon wall at once, while discharging our flames.  At the same time, a strong wind was blown from ahead, enough to make Fran squint. It was because the magic emanating from the giant antidemons was giving off physical pressure.  However, the dust around the giant antidemons had been blown away by the wind, so we could finally see them in their entirety. </p>
<p>「So big!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Aah, come closer and you’ll see how big they are!」</p>
<p>  Even Isario looked up at the small mountain of antidemons and shouted in admiration. The antidemon’s body was so pressure that even he was surprised. I think he was like a fetal again by seeing him floating in a mysterious liquid that stopped breaking gravity.  And it seemed that Fran and Isario felt the same way. </p>
<p>「Antidemon baby?」</p>
<p>「I’ve never even heard of such a thing... Besides, it’s way too big for a baby, right?」</p>
<p>「Hmm......?  The power is sucked in.」</p>
<p>『Me too!』</p>
<p>「It’s their work.  They absorb magic power from a wide area.  It’s not only us. Isario was right.  It seemed that the giant antidemons were absorbing a huge amount of magic power from the surrounding area. It was probably a kind of magic stealing ability. However, Fran, Urushi, and I were almost completely unscathed, and it seemed that Isario wasn’t working on it.  This type of power is harder to work against when the opponent is higher-ranked. It was a huge antidemon that contained a tremendous amount of power, but it seemed to be far less than us.  </p>
<p>「It looks dangerous to leave it alone.  I don’t know how much you’ve grown up, you know?」</p>
<p>「... So you’ll defeat it already?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. You need to be a little flashy.  Please get away from here」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>  That was such a technique that Isario was so flashy on his own.</p>
<p>『Fran, let’s go even further than last time』</p>
