</div><h1>Chapter 1053</h1><p>「...Is this hell...?」</p>
<p>「No, don’t you know?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, all I remember is that my Seedran was subdued by Raydoss’s shit and captured by my superiors...」</p>
<p> Apparently, the Raydoss Kingdom’s plan had caused a internal war and they were captured by their treason, their big brother. However, his big brother was also chased by his subordinates who were in the Raydoss Kingdom, and the Seedran Sea Country was practically controlled by Raydoss. </p>
<p>『Is his big brother, Suarez?』</p>
<p>「Surres?」</p>
<p>「Did you know him?」</p>
<p>「Nn, I fought him before」</p>
<p>  He was a former royalty of the Seedran Sea Kingdom, who used to use water dragon ships to piracy.  And now―― Huh? What’s going on right now?  I should have caught him and handed him over to the Beast Kingdom, but...  I don’t know what happened after that.  </p>
<p>「Captured him and handed him over to the Beast Kingdom」</p>
<p>「I see...  So, even that stupid guy has fallen to the ground too. Well, it’s not something I could tell you now that he’s in such a state...」</p>
<p> Marl looked into his hands and snorted as if he was mocking himself.  </p>
<p>「Hahaha...  When I got back to consciousness, you turned into a monster and killed your comrades, weren’t you? What kind of nightmare is it?」</p>
<p> He behaves stoutly, but his inner self must be filled with sad thoughts.  It was natural that he had become a monster when he woke up. I noticed that he had become a sword too, but he didn’t pick up his friends or family members. Marl’s long eyelashes were trembling slightly. </p>
<p>「Your race is now a demonkin...」</p>
<p>「What is that...? But the reason why I was able to escape even a little from the curse of being a slave is because of this magic beast huh...」</p>
<p>  It seemed that the curse of slavery towards men had become meaningless for Marl, who was no longer a person. Magic power was still emanating from her collar, but she seemed to be uncontrollable. However, it seemed to be incomplete.  </p>
<p>「Hmm...  I can’t kill myself.」</p>
<p>  Marl was trying to put a claw on his chest, but his body was stiff. It seemed that orders such as the ban on suicide were still in place.  </p>
<p>「I’m sorry for someone I don’t know, but... But can you kill me?」</p>
<p>「!」</p>
<p>「Please do...」</p>
<p>「... Maybe I can remove the collar」</p>
<p>「But that’s pointless.  I’m still able to maintain my rational mind, but I can clearly see that I’m gone by myself. Marl looked apologetic but in a tone of voice that did not say anything, he asked Fran to kill him.  </p>
<p>「I can only ask you.  Please, I’m begging you. I’ll let you die as a person now」</p>
<p>「...!」</p>
<p>Don’t you push yourself too hard?」</p>
<p>  The girl’s face on her huge body looked at Fran pleadingly.  Her tone seemed apologetic, but her expression looked like the girl just before she started crying.  </p>
<p>「Don’t worry. I’ll cut you down」</p>
<p>「Aah, I see...  Thank you.」</p>
<p>  Marl exhaled in relief.  </p>
<p>『Fran.  Are you okay?』</p>
<p>「Nn. I’m fine」</p>
<p>  The trauma in front of Marl was different from before. His nod was firm.  It seemed that her resolve had been confirmed by the direct plea of Marl.  </p>
<p>「My name is Marl Seedran」</p>
<p>「I’m Fran」</p>
<p>「I see... Fran, I’m grateful」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>  Marl smiled softly and quietly meditated his eyes and quietly lowered his head. He was dexterously positioned in the air like a pedestal. Fran then quietly swung me at Marl.  </p>
<p>「I’m glad to have met you―― Fran here.  Fuhahaha, that’s short...  It’s really been a short time, but I felt something similar, you know? </p>
<p>「Nn.  I’m here too」</p>
<p>「I see.  Oh, and can you free me from the water dragons?  As long as I die, I’ll leave without raging.  The country is long gone. </p>
<p>「Okay」</p>
<p>「Thank you... My Onee-san, I’ve gone first...」</p>
<p>「... Good night」</p>
<p>  goodbyes to the girls.  However, I could sense a strange reaction from my skill. It was as if the skill was talking to me.  Maybe the skill was trying to respond to Fran’s thoughts, as if she was the wielder.  My intuition told me that I should believe this reaction.  </p>
<p>『Fran, let’s only target the magic stone.  It’s on the right side of your heart. Can you tell?』</p>
<p>「... I know」</p>
<p>  As Marl became calm, he was able to sense the magic within him. Fran seemed to have understood the position of the magic stone.  Instead of swinging it upwards, she folded her arms and pulled back. Then, she performed her best thrust.  </p>
<p>「Haaaa!」</p>
<p>「...!」</p>
<p>  Indeed, I could feel the magic power flowing through Marl’s inner magic stone.  A huge amount of magic power flowed into me. But before I had the time to be happy about it, I activated several skills. I used the support skills such as blessings of the God of Wisdom and information processing to the maximum extent, while overworking the magic power absorption, spirit detection, spirit hand, great magician, and golden to the limit.  The most important ones were the spirit’s hand and golden color.  It was really faint, but I could feel the presence of a spirit from Marl. At the same time, she growled that she could use herself.  The golden color is an evolution of the skill called Mixed Slayer, which gives a special effect on beings that are created by synthesizing multiple beings. It was effective not only against antidemons but also against beings like Marl.  In addition, the magic stone implanted in it must have been something similar to a spirit. Therefore, it was possible to interfere with both the spirit’s hand and the golden color.  I couldn’t think that it would be possible to return to a human being. However, I wondered if it was possible to stabilize their presence and prevent them from taking advantage of each other.  Normal magic beasts would die from losing their magic stones if they were weakened. The reason is that they use magic power to maintain various functions of their body, and the disappearance of their magic stones is equivalent to losing their heart.  However, Mar was originally a human being.  I wondered if he could manage it without its magic stones. That was what I thought.  </p>
<p>『Magic power is spilling...』</p>
<p>「Kuaaaaaa!」</p>
<p>  But it was not going to be that simple.  As if to stabilize its existence, the magic power that flowed from Marl stopped. With Marl’s screams, magic power continues to overflow like a fountain.  </p>
<p>『Shit...』</p>
<p>  Is it impossible for me to do something like that?  Was my thought a bit shallow? As I was desperately interfering with Marl’s magic power, Fran and Marl suddenly raised their voices.  </p>
<p>「Here it is... Marl’s magic power?」</p>
<p>「This is...  warm. Is it Fran’s magic power?」</p>
<p>  What do you mean?  Fran and Marl’s magic power interfered with each other――  </p>
<p>《Confirmation of the activation of spirit magic.</p>
<p>『Eh?</p>
<p>『Eh? Spirit Magic?』</p>
