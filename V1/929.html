</div><h1>Chapter 929</h1><p>After listening to her explanation, Quina had a surprised expression on her face that even I could understand. Well, normal people probably couldn’t understand it, but I was able to understand the expression of the same type of Quina as I was reading Fran’s expression every day.</p>
<p>(So you say Saintess Sophilia was the wielder of the divine sword?)</p>
<p>『Yeah. I never thought that the true identity of that harp called Lauda was the Divine Sword, the Oracle』</p>
<p>However, according to the Divine Swords I’ve seen before, the Divine Swords “Chariot” and “Exper” were not in the shape of a sword either. Chariot was a commander’s staff, and the Experrer was just a monocle.</p>
<p>Perhaps the weapon that a Divine level blacksmith had trained was called a “Divine Sword” as practice, but its shape was often not that of a sword.</p>
<p>(So it’s an awakening of ability with a magical song enhanced by the Divine Sword...? But that doesn’t seem to be a slight strengthening)</p>
<p>『Yeah, it was amazing. Our Fran had the skill called Divine Beast Form, and Mea was in a white beast form. Besides, Lind was also fully awake as a Divine Sword』</p>
<p>(I didn’t know the extent of the backlash, but... he doesn’t seem to be small)</p>
<p>Quina muttered to herself and looked worriedly at Mea who was asleep. Even though she was constantly vomiting her poison tongue, she must be thinking about Mea.</p>
<p>Unlike us, who have little backlash thanks to Fenrir and Zefmate, Mea and Zefmate had no idea what would happen to them.</p>
<p>Then we asked her about something that had been bothering me.</p>
<p>『Where was Quina? She had been acting separately from Mea for a long time』</p>
<p>(Master-san would be fine. I was investigating the organization of the slavers.)</p>
<p>Mea and Zelos Reed must have been here to investigate and destroy the beastmen participating in the slave trafficking. Mea and Zelos Reed’s conspicuous investigation about the Beastmen Union, and Quina, who was good at stealth, was in charge of the investigation behind the scenes.</p>
<p>『Did you find out anything?』</p>
<p>(Yeah. Despite the commotion, a few of their members were also captured. Like I thought, they were backed by a blue cat organization.)</p>
<p>It seems the black market slavers had been secretly cooperating with each other, using their identities as adventurers, citizens, and merchants as fronts. Since they had been active for a long time, they seemed to have been listening to various places.</p>
<p>(Don’t do any flashy work, focus on being unsuspected. The only time we capture slaves is when they are difficult to break, such as during the antidemon season. That’s why they must have been hiding for so many years.)</p>
<p>However, the current strengthening of the Beast King’s crackdown had brought about a major change in the organization. Several slave trafficking routes had been destroyed, forcing the development of new routes.</p>
<p>The concealment of information on that new route was poor, and Quina seemed to have finally arrived at the organization.</p>
<p>『What is this new route?』</p>
<p>(It’s shipped through the dragonkin to the Raidos Kingdom.)</p>
<p>I’ve heard stories of the Raidos Kingdom buying slaves. This is probably because they are used for experiments, mine work, and many other things.</p>
<p>Even Fran might have been sent to Raydoss if she hadn’t met me. Her flashy moves had affected the continent of Gordicia, and the black market slavers were becoming unable to hide their traces.</p>
<p>『Hey, can you give us some info on the black market slavers?』</p>
<p>(Fran-san was a former illegal slave too...)</p>
<p>『Yeah. We’ve been following the slavers, but we’ve had a hard time getting any information out of them.』</p>
<p>(Alright. We knew we needed to increase our forces to target the top brass of the organization. But we’ll need your help in return.)</p>
<p>『Of course. But still, have you already gotten the top information?』</p>
<p>(Yes. However, his location is not yet confirmed. However, we know the person in question)</p>
<p>『Who is she?』</p>
<p>(They are dragonkin, the self-proclaimed Dragon King.)</p>
<p>『Dragon King Georg!?』</p>
<p>She never said she’d ask for her name again!</p>
<p>(They forcibly used the forces of the dragonkin to take over an organization that was originally dominated by blue cats. Did Master have any information on the Dragon King?)</p>
<p>『Yeah. They tried to use dragonkin to destroy the city.』</p>
<p>I told her about the evil crystals I had found in the basement and their danger. But Quina was surprised to hear one.</p>
<p>(And there were other crystals that emitted that Evil Spirit)</p>
<p>『What? Other than that, they’re in Sendia?』</p>
<p>(Yes.)</p>
<p>To their surprise, Quina and the others had discovered the underground room where the evil crystals were placed and crushed it. They had apparently entrusted the evil crystals to their collaborators.</p>
<p>『Are these collaborators under the Beast King’s command?』</p>
<p>(No, he’s an adventurer known as the Ward Dealer.)</p>
<p>『Seliadot, you’re one of Quina’s companions? Seriously?!』</p>
<p>They had been protecting Seliadot’s kin in the beastman country and had a collaborative relationship with her. It was a coincidence that Seliadot was now in the same place, but she had apparently helped us so much.</p>
<p>Quina briefly explained her situation to us.</p>
<p>『Lorelei... That survivor huh...?』</p>
<p>Her current situation was somewhat similar to that of the Black Cat kin. She probably shared the same resentment for the illegal slaves as Fran.</p>
<p>It seems Seliadot had been gathering information on the illegal slavers and reported this to the Beast Kingdom.</p>
<p>Sophie had told us that she had no clue where Seliadot was, but it seems she and Quina were secretly guarding the town.</p>
<p>Since she could sense where her ward was placed, she could use it to look for suspicious basements. If she could find the ward itself, she could definitely find it, no matter if it’s an underground room or not.</p>
<p>Moreover, the information they obtained from the dragonkin interrogation was more detailed than we knew. Quina, the Beastman of the Beastmen, could put her opponent into hypnosis and draw out the information she gathered.</p>
<p>(It seems that the self-proclaimed Dragon King actually has special powers)</p>
<p>『Divine Dragon Form?』</p>
<p>(No, that’s not true. I heard it has two attributes.)</p>
<p>The Dragon King was said to be an evil dragon in addition to a fire dragon. Therefore, he must be able to manipulate the evil crystals. Since those with multiple attributes are treated in a special way, it seemed that Georg was not allowed to claim to be the Dragon King at all.</p>
<p>The Dragon King also planned to use his menial forces to gather antidemons around Sendia and defeat them this time.</p>
<p>『Is it only recently that the Dragon King has become the leader of an illegal slaver organization?』</p>
<p>(I heard it’s been about twenty years since he’s been the leader. Fran-san?)</p>
<p>『Yeah』</p>
<p>(I’m sure it was the work of the Dragon King’s men.)</p>
<p>『I see...』</p>
<p>I see. No doubt the Dragon Kings were the ones who enslaved Fran......</p>
<p>They’ll be on my kill list number one. I’m sure they’ll get killed no matter what.</p>
<p>(Master-san! Even though you’re a sword, don’t unleash any killing intent! Fran-san and Urushi will have nightmares about it)</p>
<p>『Oops, sorry.』</p>
<p>It seems that Quina had enough killing intent to make us feel a little irritated.</p>
<p>『Quina. About the Dragon King. Let me know if you know more about it, okay?』</p>
<p>(...I understand)</p>
<p>『Kukukuh...』</p>
