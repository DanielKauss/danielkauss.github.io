</div><h1>Chapter 1103</h1><p>Fran and Urushi ran through the town of Alessa, where no one was leaving. People were breathing in the houses, and all of the stalls were closed. In Gordicia, even if the town was attacked, people were walking around surprisingly well. They might have been used to attacking antidemons and had little sense of urgency. So, this was the real time of the war. Soldiers were patrolling the town, but no one had done anything to Fran. It was probably because she was too fast, and no one was undead by any stretch of the imagination. They must think that this was an messenger for adventurers. They must have thought that this was an messenger for adventurers.  As one would expect, she was stopped in front of the lord’s mansion, but she could be recognized instantly if she presented her adventurer’s card. Fran’s name seemed to be more recognized in Alessa than I had imagined. So, I didn’t doubt her, and I didn’t expect her to understand right away when I presented my card.  On the first floor of the lord’s mansion, there was a commander in case of emergencies, and important people were gathered here. Klimut, the guildmaster, Urushi, the leader of the Alessa Knights, and a plain man on the upper echelons.  Apparently, this man was Alessa’s feudal lord.  I couldn’t sense any supremacy or sharpness from him. He was a somewhat dressed uncle who seemed to be everywhere.  He doesn’t look reliable, but I wonder if he’ll be okay? Or is he an irrational type, seemingly bad, but amazing when the time comes?  </p>
<p>「Fran-san...  I have to welcome you」</p>
<p>「Nn.  It’s here」</p>
<p>「The Black Lightning Princess! The girl from back then has become quite famous!」</p>
<p>  Klimut had a somewhat austere expression on his face.  Urushi was very welcome.  Klimut must have disliked Fran――or rather, the fact that a child would be involved in a war.  But now that he can’t read the forces of his enemies, we should welcome the strong reinforcements. The interests of Alessa and the Kranzel Kingdom should take precedence over Klimut’s personal feelings. Therefore, even if Klimut himself was not welcome, the Guild Master could not help but welcome Fran.  </p>
<p>「Klimut, will we talk later?」</p>
<p>「Stop talking?」</p>
<p>「Nn.  I want to know more about Spirit Magic」</p>
<p>「Well, that’s fine though... But can I wait after this commotion is over?」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>  Fran understood that the situation was not so good as it was now.  </p>
<p>「Are you the Black Lightning Princess?  I’m Zenos Amkranse. I’m the feudal lord of this town」</p>
<p>「Maybe?」</p>
<p>「It was just a decoration. Well, I’m just here, so don’t worry about it」</p>
<p>  He was a nobleman who looked quite careless.  Was he really a feudal lord? Well, it was small as a town, and maybe it was a lower-ranking nobleman. I thought so, but I was wrong.  </p>
<p>「Fran.  He looks like a royalty. You shouldn’t treat him too carelessly just because he doesn’t have dignity, you know?」</p>
<p>「Urushi. You’re saying something worse than him, are you?」</p>
<p>「Ooh?  Really?」</p>
<p>  No, wait.  What did you just say? </p>
<p>「Royal?」</p>
<p>「Bye-type.  The only thing he can do is to force the lord of the town close to the front line」</p>
<p>「Hmm~」</p>
<p>  No, no!  Royals are royalty if they’re bye-type! But it’s not because of such interest that they’re </p>
<p>「Hmmm!」</p>
<p>!  </p>
<p>「You don’t really have to worry.  They only allow you to call yourself Kranzel. Now that you have the power to fight, it’s much more important for you」</p>
<p> He really was the lord of the ornaments. The fact that Klimut and Urushi were friendly showed that he was not a bad person.  However, he didn’t seem to be a very capable person, because he hadn’t been able to completely stop the exclusive use of Augist and Count Ormez. To tell you the truth, he might be the type to leave it to others if it was better to leave it to them.  </p>
<p>「The defense of this town is left to the Knights and Adventurers Guilds. Fran-san, I’d appreciate your cooperation.  Are you sure?」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「Well, for now, let’s deal with the undead that are currently attacking us.」</p>
<p>「Indeed.  It’s gonna be difficult for the knights to deal with the undead.」</p>
<p>「Is that so?」</p>
<p>「It will be tough if I don’t use magic.」</p>
<p> Since the undead keep moving even when they are slashed or thrust, it must be difficult for the knights to deal with them.  However, because the main forces of the adventurers are missing, they are also behind in dealing with the adventurers.  </p>
<p>「It’s pitiful to be relying on children, but please kick the undead away. Can you handle them?」</p>
<p>「I can afford if that’s all that matters.」</p>
<p>「Phew. We’ve already heard the report about them in Gordicia, but they’re still just running around, right?」</p>
<p>「Fufun.」</p>
<p>「I don’t praise them.」</p>
<p>  Klimut smiled bitterly.  I guess he wanted to tell them not to hurry, but it saved them this time. I guess he can’t say that strongly. As for me, those who worry about Fran like this are rare, so I’d like you to say more.  But I can’t tell adventurers who are about to go to the battlefield </p>
<p>「Don’t do too much」</p>
<p>. </p>
<p>「But first, please take care of the undead that have entered the town」</p>
<p>「Wasn’t that pretty amazing?」</p>
<p>「Yes, they haven’t defeated it yet.  Moreover, they have a high level of stealth, so I haven’t caught up with their spirits yet. It’s almost a miracle that I was able to find them when I entered the town」</p>
<p>  You won’t be able to let your guard down if you even sprinkle spirits on them. If you weren’t careful, it could be much more troublesome than the undead outside.  </p>
<p>「Okay」</p>
<p>「I’m begging you not to cause any damage to the town.」</p>
<p>  It’s Klimut for telling us not to make any mistakes here. He must have a good idea of Fran!  </p>
<p>「After that, please go to the wall’s support if at all possible.」</p>
<p>「What about the adventurers outside?」</p>
<p>「No one is deploying from this town. They have ordered them to draw in and strike them with long-range attacks!」</p>
<p>「So you’re okay with being flashy then?」</p>
<p>「No problem.」</p>
<p>  If they went outside now, they would be violating the orders, and even if they got caught up in her, they would not be responsible for Fran. Well, if they were to kill her, Fran might be concerned about it, so why don’t Urushi and I be careful?  </p>
<p>『Urushi. If there’s a presence of a person outside the walls, let me know』</p>
<p>(Woof!)</p>
<p>  Or was it Raidos’ scouting force? It’s unlikely that they’re external adventurers who came to Alessa to rescue and became acquainted with the undead.  Well, we’ll start by handling them in the town.  </p>
<p>「Let’s go then!」</p>
<p>「We’ll leave it to you!」</p>
<p>「If anything comes up, you can use the knights!  Come on, take this with you」</p>
<p>「Thanks」</p>
<p>  Urushi threw the emblems of his knights at them. So, this would be a substitute for a power of command.  </p>
<p>「Black Lightning Princess, take care of Alessa」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Well, the first thing we needed to do was to deal with the situation in the town. </p>
<p>「Okay, let’s go!」</p>
<p>「We’ll leave it to you then!」</p>
<p>「If there is anything we can do, you can use the knights! Come on, take this with you」</p>
<p>「Thanks」</p>
<p> Urushi threw the emblem of his knight order at us. So, this would be a substitute for a power of command. </p>
<p>「Black Lightning Princess, take care of Alessa」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p> Fran then ran out of the room, with Zenos bowing his head and Klimut looking as stern as ever.</p>
