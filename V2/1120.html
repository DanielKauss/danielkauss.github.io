</div><h1>Chapter 1120</h1><p>The valiant warriors made a lot of noise, but the youngsters didn’t end there. Some were sleeping on the guards, others started to stuff themselves with booze, and some even started to unload their supplies as they pleased. Fran had been completely underestimated. They had suffered no direct damage so far, so they let her do whatever they wanted. However, the unapproved use of supplies was not good. Or rather, the fact that they took out their food was one of Fran’s reasons for accepting the request. After all, one of their motives was to deliver food to everyone fighting on the front lines. After all, one of her motives was to deliver food to everyone fighting in the front lines.  </p>
<p>「Oi, come here!」</p>
<p>  Fran called out to the men surrounding the campfire. They heard their voices, albeit quiet, but they must have heard their voices.  However, they completely ignored her.  They were still underestimating her.  </p>
<p>「Oi」</p>
<p>「Aah―?  What the hell――Bwah!」</p>
<p>「W-What are you―― Bwah!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  Seeing the annoying faces of the men, Fran lost the will to argue.  She quickly erased her expression and punched the men in the face to blow them up.  But she didn’t end there. Just in time she was still unconscious, she beat up the men. The other valiant soldiers, who had been watching the dumbass with a thin smile, would also begin to show their fear as their faces transformed and the sound of their limbs cracked.  But even then, Fran’s fist did not stop. She would have struck them 30 shots at a time, changing the opponent to a moderate amount so that the three of them could not escape. When the punishment was over, there were pathetic adventurers crying, spitting out gastric juices and blood with broken bones all over their bodies.  It may seem like a bit much, but I think we need to do this as a show to the other valiant soldiers. Fran had thought that far――.  </p>
<p>「Wait, Fran-san?」</p>
<p>  I only made a mistake in stopping them because of all the frustration I had.  You look strangely refreshing! Well, I didn’t feel sorry about it now!  </p>
<p>『W-Well, just heal her for now!』</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>  Magic heals the misjudged merchandisers who had been half-killed due to their wrong power control. After confirming that all their wounds were healed, Fran uttered a voice.  </p>
<p>「... Everyone.  You all line up there」</p>
<p> Fran’s actions, which broke down the three of them, seemed to have shocked the valiant soldiers.  They hadn’t seen Fran’s interrogation before, but if they could heal such wounds in an instant, they would have punished them even worse...? Everyone seemed to think so.  The vast majority of the valiant soldiers had begun to move as they were told. However, some of them had to complain under any circumstances.  </p>
<p>「W-What are you mumbling about――Gyaahaah!」</p>
<p>  A large man over two meters tall was about to pack Fran―― and was blown about ten meters away. His metal armour was uneven.  Seeing Fran knocking out the giant with a single fist, we should be able to understand his overwhelming strength. Moreover, Fran, who had unleashed her recovery magic, told her that she would “Stand up and line up there” in an unforgivable voice.  This time the grown man stood up immediately and straightened up without complaining at all.  His body was trembling pitifully. It was probably because of his fear and still lingering pain. The soldiers hurriedly lined up in front of Fran after feeling the same way.  </p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>  Fran continued to glare in silence in front of the blue-faced warriors.  </p>
<p>(Master, what should we do with them?)</p>
<p>『Eh? Did they just line up without thinking?』</p>
<p>(Nn.  I just lined up in front of them for the time being)</p>
<p> Apparently, she ordered them to line up in anger, but they hadn’t thought about what to do after that.  Fran, who had been silent for a long time, seemed to be so angry that she remained silent to the men. They were scared and holding their breath while waiting. Well, I guess she won’t mind staying like this for a while. </p>
<p>『What do you want to do?』</p>
<p>(I don’t want to do anything rash)</p>
<p>『It’s been showing off, so why don’t we just listen to what they have to say for a while?』</p>
<p>(But it’ll be useless if we just take them with us. We’ll cause trouble if we do whatever we want on the battlefield anyway.)</p>
<p>『O-ooh.  That might be true』</p>
<p>(I don’t want to take those who might bother everyone)</p>
<p>  I never thought that Fran would think that far ahead!  In the past, she would only beat them up and let them do what they had to say on their own. But I never thought that it would only cause her own anger to come out of her mouth, but also make sure she was thinking about the future!  I was even touched!  </p>
<p>『So you’re saying that you want us to work seriously and not say it like we are? It’s not just now, we’ll stay that way forever』</p>
<p>(Nn.  Can you do it?)</p>
<p>『Hmm?』</p>
<p>  By showing them the power relationship, they might be able to become calm for now, but I think they’re gonna do the same for anyone but Fran...  Do they break their hearts in a mock battle?  No, that wouldn’t be different from beating them up. Besides, it will take a lot of time... A way to regenerate and regenerate those who behaved badly while moving.  </p>
<p>(Master?)</p>
<p>『Aah, well~.  For now, I’m going to just train these guys in a short period of time―― but they’ll regenerate them, right? They’re all problem children, so it looks quite difficult』</p>
<p>(Training...)</p>
<p>『I-I’m not!  I just making the wrong statement!  Regeneration!  Regeneration!』</p>
<p>(I see)</p>
<p>  After Fran nodded lightly, she thought in silence.  Eh?This was a way to regenerate and calm the bad guys while moving from place to place. </p>
<p>(Master?)</p>
<p>『Aah, well~. For now, I’m just going to train them in a short period of time――but they’ll just regenerate themselves, okay? They’re all problem children, so it’s gonna be quite difficult』</p>
<p>(Training...)</p>
<p>『I-I’m not! I just making the wrong statement! Regeneration! Regeneration!』</p>
<p>(I see)</p>
<p> After Fran nodded lightly, she thought in silence. Eh? She didn’t really want to train you, did she?</p>
