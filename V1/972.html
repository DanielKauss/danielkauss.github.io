</div><h1>Chapter 972</h1><p>In order to stop the magic circle, I stowed away the evil crystals. Then the magic circle began to shine brighter than ever.</p>
<p>I’ve lost my energy source, why!? No, maybe a booby rap for when it was lifted?</p>
<p>『Fran! Teleport!』</p>
<p>「Okay!」</p>
<p>I used teleportation to escape the hole at once. Immediately afterward, a huge explosion occurred at the bottom of the hole.</p>
<p>In order to destroy the magic circle, Fran released a flame spell just before it teleported. At the bottom, a bright red flame swirled, and countless pieces of flame powder rose to the edge of the hole.</p>
<p>However, the evil energy was as thick as ever. It seemed that it couldn’t be destroyed by the explosion just now.</p>
<p>A few seconds later, the black aura-like evil energy that stood up from the hole suddenly disappeared. However, that didn’t mean the evil energy had disappeared.</p>
<p>Something emitting powerful evil energy appeared in the hole. I looked down from the edge.</p>
<p>「......Evil people?」</p>
<p>『That must be what they call an Ibilberserker.』</p>
<p>It looked like a doll made of twisted and hardened evil energy. Its outline wavered from side to side, similar to that of a ghost.</p>
<p>Named as the berserker, it seemed like it would go on a rampage until it was summoned and killed. This must be a trap to kill anyone who interfered with the activation of the magic circle.</p>
<p>But still, I feel strangely high killing intent, or rather, relentless. It should be enough to take damage just by luring antidemons, including giants, with this magic circle and making them rampage.</p>
<p>Moreover, even if the giant-type destroys the evil crystals and the magic circle, the evil berserkers would rampage around. I could feel a desire to destroy the city no matter what.</p>
<p>「Wooo~f!」</p>
<p>「Your voice was mixed with evil too」</p>
<p>『If we leave it alone, the successors might be in danger. It can’t be helped. We’ll take it down.』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>The evil berserker was so dense that it almost made one get sick just by getting close to it. For an ordinary adventurer, it would surely be a trap for death.</p>
<p>But they were really bad.</p>
<p>『I’ll make it a hedgehog before we get out of the hole!』</p>
<p>I transformed my cords to create countless spears. I then attacked the Ibiru Berserker from all directions so that there was no gap left to dodge them.</p>
<p>Moreover, Fran was continuously casting thunder magic from above. Although the paralyzing did not work on her, the series of magic blasts dulled her movements.</p>
<p>In the end, she could not evade it at all, and the entire body of the Ibiruberserker was pierced by a spear that I had created. However, since it was not an ordinary lifeform, that alone was not a fatal wound.</p>
<p>The sensation coming from the spear was as if it had pierced through even a bubble or a bran. It was a little touched by the way it was clothed in magic power, but if it hadn’t done that, it would have just slipped through it.</p>
<p>Well, this was also within our expectations. In the first place, we did not dare to activate the Evil Crusher so as not to defeat it with a single blow.</p>
<p>I immediately used my Evil Spirit Control to absorb the Evil Spirits of the Evil God. I guess it was because I was getting used to its skills that I was able to do this quite well. With its body made up of evil spirits, Evil Spirit Absorption was a deadly ability for me.</p>
<p>The evil energy in his body quickly decreased, and he disappeared in less than a minute.</p>
<p>『Despite all that evil, only about 500 magic power has been recovered.』</p>
<p>It seems that it was not very efficient to convert Evil Spirits into magic power. However, it was a great harvest that we realized that it was possible to suck evil spirits out of humans.</p>
<p>After confirming that the Evil Spirits had completely disappeared from the magic circle, we decided to return to the main force.</p>
<p>When we reported on the evil crystals and the magic circle, they looked difficult. It was probably because there was a greater possibility that the Dragon King was involved in this anomaly.</p>
<p>The other adventurers had also come back, but they still couldn’t find any survivors.</p>
<p>Both Isario and Shikimi had decided that the residents had been annihilated by the antidemons. The second unit decided to cancel their investigation and head for the nearest town from here to replenish and share information.</p>
<p>We sensed the presence of a large number of people gathered around the day after our departure and arriving in the town a little further away.</p>
<p>(Mmm. There’s something there......!)</p>
<p>『I could feel the presence of many people here! That’s quite a lot!』</p>
<p>Did they have some kind of army? They were quite slow for a battle. They seemed to be heading in the same direction as us, as if the civilians were mixed in.</p>
<p>「Hey young miss, can I ask you to check on someone?」</p>
<p>「Okay」</p>
<p>「This could turn into a battle, so take a few of them with you.」</p>
<p>Isario and Zelos Reed seemed to have noticed the group in front of them and sent a few people, including Fran, to scout out. They selected a scout from the adventurers and departed with Fran.</p>
<p>If push comes to shove, Fran will lure the enemy in and make the adventurers run to Isario. That was what I thought, but they were not enemies.</p>
<p>There were also adventurers and soldiers, but the vast majority of them were ordinary people, just like what we had felt at the beginning. There were probably more than a thousand of them. Urushi also tried to hide in the shadows and approached them by himself, trying to avoid being provoked as little as possible.</p>
<p>The adventurers who saw us were also relieved to learn that we were a child. The adventurers, who seemed to be the leader of the group, called out to us from a distance.</p>
<p>「Did you come from the town of Saate? If so, did you know what had happened to the huge antidemons in that town?」</p>
<p>「Nn! We defeated it」</p>
<p>「Eh? W-What do you mean......? With that many people......?」</p>
<p>「Who are you guys?」</p>
<p>「Y-yeah. We’re residents of the town of Saate. We’re in the middle of evacuating......」</p>
<p>The town was destroyed, but there were apparently some residents who survived. Many residents were sacrificed by the antidemons, but about half of them had escaped with difficulty.</p>
<p>There were many things they wanted to know, but this place was dangerous. For now, they explained that they were coming with an army and decided to move with us to the town ahead.</p>
<p>『I hope he’s still safe in this town...』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>But our wish was not fulfilled, and as we continued on our way, we saw the town that had been destroyed by the giant antidemons, just like Sarte.</p>
<p>(Right, he’s a giant......!)</p>
<p>It seems that even in a city four or five times larger than a sate, that huge body couldn’t do anything against it.</p>
<p>「Y-yeah...... The town of Shallus is......」</p>
<p>Seeing the neighboring town finally being destroyed by the giant-type, the refugees from the Sattes stopped. Some of them knelt and sobbed. They must have been in despair.</p>
