</div><h1>Chapter 1094</h1><p>I was born several decades ago, it seems. Not that it means much to me considering how I don’t remember living that long myself.</p>
<p>This time, Fran was thinking of going to Alessa――but she had accepted a new request in the lockers.</p>
<p>Since the two were sent to protect each other, Fran couldn’t refuse.</p>
<p>Knights and soldiers had gathered at rockers, but they had nothing in terms of strength. That’s when Fran, a B-ranker with an alias, got hit with a white arrow.</p>
<p>Normally, it would be impossible to rely on adventurers to escort the princess, but the proxy of the feudal lord is the Guild Master and Kranzel has a high status as an adventurer. Especially when it comes to adventurers with aliases, they are more trustworthy than knights who are not good at it.</p>
<p>Urushi’s transport network made it easy for us to get to know him, so I’m sure he didn’t have a better fit than Fran.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why Fran accepted this request was that Alessa’s battle situation was even better than before.</p>
<p>The Raydoss army deployed in the north seemed to be at their waists after obtaining information that the surprise attack failed. They had originally planned to intercept the Kingdom of Kranzel, but both their naval and surprise attacks had been destroyed.</p>
<p>We caused some damage to Barbra and Dars, but that alone was not very meaningful for the northern war. We might be wondering if we should attack or retreat on our own.</p>
<p>Some of the Kranzel forces that had already gathered in Alessa were making their way in to Raidos. Even so, Raidos side had been repeatedly checking on them, and small-scale clashes were only happening sporadically near the border.</p>
<p>This way, Fran wouldn’t have to rush to Alessa.</p>
<p>In fact, bringing Derick and Satia to the royal capital could defeat Raidos. In the bigger picture, that would help Alessa. Well, that was what I had taught Fran.</p>
<p>「Fran-san. I look forward to working with you」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>The lower class demon standing behind Satya was carrying a delinquent that had been ducked in a gauntlet with a restraint. The chain that was wrapped all over his body was a magic tool. It was an item used to steal power and stop him from escaping.</p>
<p>Notes: I got an issue with my editor, he hasn’t done anything on his part for these past ten days, and this is the last chapter he has edited. He’s miraculously back! XD</p>
<p>Against the background of such a terrible looking delinquent, the two girls were talking in a friendly manner. But didn’t they care? Both of them were amazing. The adventurers and soldiers who were not leaving were quite annoying though.</p>
<p>「Urushi too, nice to meet you」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>We set out with a lot of people watching us, but the journey to the capital was really pleasant. We had been on guard against any attacks, but as expected, we couldn’t do anything about Urushi as he was flying in the sky.</p>
<p>In fact, it might be more dangerous to go there after we had arrived.</p>
<p>We were going to prepare ourselves a little farther away from the Royal Capital. The appearance of the giant Urushi would only cause chaos in the Royal Capital.</p>
<p>However, since Urushi was just smaller, there was no problem here. Fran was teleporting in the air, Satya was carried by Ronowe, and Drick was carried by the demon.</p>
<p>As we continued, we saw several knights waiting for us at the gate to the royal capital. We shouldn’t know the exact arrival time though... Maybe they’ve been waiting ever since we mentioned we were going to transfer Dimitris and Satya? I’m relieved we didn’t have to take any detours on the way there.</p>
<p>「Satia-sama, right?」</p>
<p>「Thank you very much.」</p>
<p>「Sigh! And then there’s Fran-dono, their guard, and this guy......」</p>
<p>「Nn. She’s a operative from the Raidos Kingdom」</p>
<p>The knights gave him such a stern stare. Their feelings for the Raidos people must have been considerably reduced due to the war between them.</p>
<p>「That man, come here.」</p>
<p>「Understood」</p>
<p>The delicate pendant was placed in a huge metal crate brought in by the knights. It was a large crate of two meters square.</p>
<p>It was made of magical metal, and I could see that it was increasing its strength with magic. Moreover, it seemed that there were some techniques to reduce its weight, and the knights were carrying it leisurely.</p>
<p>It seems to be used more often in cases where the opponent does not want to escape than in an iron cage. In a world where there is magic and skills, this is probably what it means to be able to escape without doing it.</p>
<p>After that, Derick was taken by about ten knights and Fran was transported by carriage with Satya. That’s why we can’t let the royalty walk.</p>
<p>Our destination was, of course, the Royal Castle.</p>
<p>I wondered if we should act as Satya’s escort, but Fran was also a valuable witness. So, we didn’t treat her as a bonus.</p>
<p>Both of them were led to a place that looked like the reception room of the royal castle and were greeted by a dignified person. After Fran had filled her stomach with a large amount of tea and snacks, someone finally came to her.</p>
<p>Rather, he was someone important. Count Bailleys was there. Velmeria’s father and the leader of a knight order that protected the royal capital. I’m sure her daughter had taken responsibility for the rampage in the royal capital and had been punished in some way...</p>
<p>Apparently, he was still in a high position in the knight order. Or maybe he had just returned in a short period of time?</p>
<p>「It is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Sidre Bailleys, and I am in charge of entertaining Her Royal Highness and interviewing important reference points.」</p>
<p>He belonged to the Guard Knights! Even though he was no longer the leader of the group, he seemed to still be important to us.</p>
<p>We’ve met Fran, and it was easy for us too. I guess the Kranzel Kingdom understood this and assigned Count Bailleys to this role.</p>
<p>In fact, the conversation went very smoothly from that point on.</p>
<p>Satya’s mouth told us what Filurias was trying to do, and Fran told us about the situation at that time and what she had learned from Dimitris after that.</p>
<p>「His Royal Highness Satya. My country is not going to seek any compensation or apology from the Kingdom of Philias for this incident」</p>
<p>「But we are!」</p>
<p>「We have no proof that you have tried to do this, and I have no intention of getting along with the Kingdom of Philias at this time of the year. In fact, I would rather deepen our friendly relations with them」</p>
<p>In other words, all of them will be fine, so I guess they should be able to get along with the Kingdom of Philias. For the current Kingdom of Kranzel, that should be the most appreciated.</p>
<p>「If we lose to our allies and get a little money or supplies, we won’t be able to gain an advantage over the Raidos Kingdom」</p>
<p>Satya may have wanted to be punished, but that was a choice that no one would benefit from. Even though she was royalty, she still couldn’t understand Satya, a child.</p>
<p>I heard along the way that both Satia and Fran were said to be mentally assimilated by making a deep contract with the demon. Therefore, the Royal Family of Philias was said to have achieved mental maturing quickly. Well, it was quite obvious compared to Fran.</p>
<p>Still, it was not like she had become an adult or a sudden increase in knowledge. Therefore, it felt a bit awkward. It was like there was a mixture of calmness and childishness.</p>
<p>「We have avoided any clear military tie-up with the Kingdom of Philias up until now. However, this time we would like to further strengthen our ties with each other」</p>
<p>「......Okay. I’ll do my best if I can.」</p>
<p>Apparently they had a shallow cooperation so as not to provoke Raidos. They wanted to take that advantage of Satya in time and send him to the allied forces.</p>
<p>Well, I guess it’s not a bad thing for both countries.</p>
