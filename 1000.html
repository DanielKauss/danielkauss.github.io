</div><h1>Chapter 1000</h1><p>While there was a fierce exchange of killings between the two, Fran concentrated quietly, breathing deeply.</p>
<p>Movement and stillness.</p>
<p>The atmosphere in which they placed themselves was so different that it was a wonder that they were in the same space.</p>
<p>「Phew.........」</p>
<p>I knew it was powerful, but to think it was a failed divine sword!</p>
<p>It’s not just Fran, I’m continuing to build up my power as well. I can make sure that when Fran turns to attack, I’ll increase her power to the maximum.</p>
<p>I focus on Divine Dragon Form and apply Divine Attributes to my magic power. My blade gets covered with the Divine Attribute too, but it’s not enough.</p>
<p>That monstrous Dragon King needs more power to inflict a painful blow.</p>
<p>Even with my skills at full power, it was still not enough.</p>
<p>As I focused my consciousness and gathered strength within myself, I learned many things that I had never known before. I didn’t know that a slight divine attribute was emanating from the blessing of the Gods within me.</p>
<p>I was also able to sense stronger special skills from them, like Evil Domination and Money-Formulas.</p>
<p>I guess it was thanks to the Divine Dragon Form that her senses were sharpened. I can also understand Fenrir and Announcer-san, which I had never understood myself before.</p>
<p>She was inside me, and now she was asleep. I could tell that they were in the middle of healing their wounds after being severely damaged.</p>
<p>And then I dive deeper into myself. I couldn’t see anything visually, but I felt as if I was enveloped in darkness. The jet-black darkness that clung to my soul.</p>
<p>I recognize this darkness.</p>
<p>It was a sealed area within the fragment of the Evil God that existed in the depths of my being. Not only the fragment but its surroundings were also filled with darkness.</p>
<p>He must have been terrified before, but now he was not terrified at all. I guess it was because he realized that this darkness was no enemy.</p>
<p>And in the middle of that darkness, I met him.</p>
<p>Something fearsome, with tremendous power. Just by being conscious, I could feel a powerful Evil Spirit clinging to me. Evil Spirit that covered my soul and made me feel as if I was stroking it. That Evil Spirit whispered to me.</p>
<p>「CONSUME ALL!CONSUME ALL! All――」</p>
<p>『Aah, yes yes, that’s fine then』</p>
<p>It was a piece of the Evil God. Everything it released was vile, and even a faint exhalation was a dense miasma. I see why the people of this world consider it evil.</p>
<p>However, I had a slightly different impression of him.</p>
<p>It was something that made me feel uneasy just by sensing its presence, but I didn’t think it was simply evil.</p>
<p>I cut through the sea of evil energy and headed for it. In my ears, there were multiple voices of “eat everything”, and the evil tentacles were trying to tighten my mind.</p>
<p>But I ignored it. I could ignore it. I’m sure the people in this world had long been controlled by the Evil Gods.</p>
<p>But it didn’t work on me. I guess it was because I’m from Earth.</p>
<p>And when I thought I had pierced through a large amount of Evil Spirits, I sensed an even greater amount of Evil Spirits. It was somehow more than just Evil Spirits.</p>
<p>Do they resemble the Divine Attribute? It was like an Evil Spirit with the Divine Attribute.</p>
<p>But strangely enough, I felt that my Evil Spirit had weakened. Well, somehow, it was.</p>
<p>It was a small being that radiated this Evil God’s temper. It had a power that was neither small nor tremendous. But it was a pitiful being that was bound and restrained by some kind of power.</p>
<p>After all, even I could tell if he had gone this far.</p>
<p>『Uuuuu...』</p>
<p>『...Are you the pieces of the Evil Gods?』</p>
<p>『...Uuuuuuuuu...』</p>
<p>『Oi』</p>
<p>『Uuuu......』</p>
<p>It’s no good, huh? What I’m sensing is a mass of Evil God’s energy, tightly held together by a mysterious power. This must be the fragment of the Evil God sealed inside me.</p>
<p>I called out to her, remembering that I had a conversation with the Goddess of Chaos before, but the piece of the Evil God was nothing but a grunt.</p>
<p>「If only I could speak in high-pitched tones, then why did I ask that?」</p>
<p>No, I couldn’t help but call her. Because the moan that the Evil God Fragment let out sounded like the cry of a young girl.</p>
<p>Why did her creepy and fearsome voice sound like that of a girl’s......?</p>
<p>『Uuuuuuuu!』</p>
<p>『Shut up!』</p>
<p>As I got closer to my consciousness, my moans grew louder. Like I thought, the infant felt frightened and cried at the sight of it.</p>
<p>『Hmmm』</p>
<p>『...Uuuuuu』</p>
<p>Somehow, don’t get out of shape. Well, that’s fine. Even if you can’t understand my words, I can still draw out its power. If I draw out the Evil God’s energy with Evil Domination―――.</p>
<p>『No, wait』</p>
<p>There is no doubt that this was a piece of the Evil God. If we were to one-sidedly control and use that power, would we take advantage of the Gods? Eh? But I’ve been using Evil Spirits before... What? Was it bad?</p>
<p>However, the Evil Spirit I felt before was just like a leak that leaked out. T-maybe, it’s okay...? But I’m not sure I’d get any power from the Evil God Fragment. But if I could use this Evil God’s spirit, I would definitely be useful to Fran...</p>
<p>「Stop that.」</p>
<p>『Whoa! T-Whoa!?』</p>
<p>「Nn? Master?」</p>
<p>『Huh? Fran? Why are you here......? No, who is that one?』</p>
<p>This must be some kind of place under my subconscious mind. It’s not a place, it’s just I’m focused inside of myself.</p>
<p>Why was Fran inside such a consciousness? She wasn’t an illusion. It was clearly the real Fran. Besides, there was something huge that emitted a tremendous aura next to her.</p>
<p>They looked like a mass of Divine Energy. At first glance, they looked like beastmen too.</p>
<p>Its entire body was covered in fur, with a strange look like a wolf, a lion, and a bear combined. However, its head was equipped with long antennae like a sea lion, and its four eyes were double-eyed. It also had dragonkin-like wings growing on its back.</p>
<p>「I came here to give blessings to new qualified people, but I never thought I’d meet the academy of the Goddess of Chaos......」</p>
<p>『Do you know the Goddess of Chaos?』</p>
<p>Could it be? A mass of Divine Power, a combination of beasts and insects? And I knew the Goddess of Chaos. No, I never thought I was myself, right?</p>
<p>「That person is the one I am talking to」</p>
<p>『F-for real? The Goddess of Beasts and Insects?』</p>
<p>「Yeah」</p>
<p>『Uweh!?』</p>
