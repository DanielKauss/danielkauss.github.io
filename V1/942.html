</div><h1>Chapter 942</h1><p>It was the evening of the day Fran and Urushi arrived in Brutori.</p>
<p>Finally, an army of antidemons appeared. The black swarm that filled the plains was a familiar sight.</p>
<p>Unlike the people in the town who looked somewhat frightened, Fran and I were more relaxed than ever. This time, we had three divine sword users, so it was more difficult to worry about the damage caused by the antidemons.</p>
<p>Looking down at the plains from the top of the walls, Fran was slightly dissatisfied. She asked me about it, biting a little bit of a skewer.</p>
<p>(Should we deploy?)</p>
<p>『It’s no use. What should we do if we get caught up in the attack of a Divine Sword? Besides, we don’t want to fight against a big country』</p>
<p>(Mrgh.)</p>
<p>I told Fran, who asked me something like “Maybe”, that I shouldn’t do it. Fran already knew this, but I guess she would be a little annoying when the battle started in front of her.</p>
<p>「Addle is coming out.」</p>
<p>『Hmmm, I still can’t see the wielder of the Divine Sword』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Even at a distance, I could see Addle walking at the head of the holy knights deploying on the Sanatorium grounds. A smiling face with no fear or worry on her unhurried steps.</p>
<p>I’d say he was as strong as guild master.</p>
<p>However, no matter how strong we tried to find it, I couldn’t believe it was worthy of being the wielder of the divine sword.</p>
<p>I knew it. It was only a Divine Sword that approved of him, but he wasn’t really that good.</p>
<p>I’d like to appraise her, but I don’t know what kind of problem would happen if she misjudged the Divine Sword-Her wielder.</p>
<p>I could make an excuse if we meet him unexpectedly on the battlefield, but now he’s completely on our side. We’ll have no choice but to watch and see what he fights.</p>
<p>「That’s the Blade of Origin, Alpha.」</p>
<p>『W-well, that’s pretty cool』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>That’s a lie. He looks super cool.</p>
<p>Its color was pure white. Everything was white, from the sheath to the hilt to the blade. There was nothing that could be called a guard, and the lower half of the blade was split into two legs and stretched out to the side like an Y-shaped hilt. That must be what it was doing.</p>
<p>Its entire body was decorated with fine details, and some of it was made of silver metal with a rainbow-colored sheen. It was obvious from the looks of it that it was not just a normal sword.</p>
<p>It was probably a long sword, but I wonder if its blade was a little wider and wider.</p>
<p>Just by pulling it out of the sheath, I could feel that a huge amount of magic power was already swirling around me. In fact, I could even feel a slight hint of the Divine Attribute in it.</p>
<p>Ader held up his Primordial Sword, Alpha, high and pointed its tip to the sky. It was a very picture-perfect pose for a handsome young man.</p>
<p>「Divine Sword Release!」</p>
<p>She easily used it. I thought it would be even more detestable, but she released her Divine Sword from the beginning.</p>
<p>With Addle’s shout, the divine sword Alpha shone brightly.</p>
<p>The white light that stood out in the wilderness was the emission of Divine Power from Addle and her Divine Sword.</p>
<p>Even us here felt a tingle from the tremendous power. The holy knights in front of us would have to physically hold on to it or they would have been blown away.</p>
<p>That’s what I thought, but it seemed to be a well-trained holy knight. All of them had thrust their swords into the ground and held their ground there, close to the position of the King.</p>
<p>In a large country like this, it was unacceptable to show such a pathetic appearance due to the power of their Divine Swords.</p>
<p>A few seconds later.</p>
<p>When the torrent of Divine Power subsided, I saw a completely different appearance than before.</p>
<p>It looked almost the same. The figure of the Divine Sword was the same as before it was released, and the equipment of Addle was almost the same. The only change was the thin light of magic power that covered her body.</p>
<p>However, the aura it unleashed was that of a different person.</p>
<p>「She’s strong......!」</p>
<p>『Yeah. Is that really Adors?』</p>
<p>It’s not just that his stats had increased. I could tell just by looking at him standing with a sword. The current Addle is at the level of a Sword King. His skills had clearly evolved.</p>
<p>That’s when I remembered what I heard about Alpha’s abilities before.</p>
<p>It was the oldest and most fearsome. It empowered its wielder with the Semi God Transformation skill.</p>
<p>All of her stats had been ten times higher than before, and she now could see through all kinds of concealment. She also listened to everything in the country. In addition to that, she said that all of her skills were at the highest level.</p>
<p>The important thing is that all our skills are at the highest level.</p>
<p>What would happen if, on the assumption that I used the Primordial Sword Alpha, I raised it on average without specializing in status, and I acquired a large number of skills at a low level?</p>
<p>He has over 100 skills at the highest level, and all of his stats are over 3,000. I’m sure a monster like him will be born.</p>
<p>So that’s the man standing there, Adar Yaresfeim.</p>
<p>She shouldn’t have felt strong. Most of her skills were at low levels. Her status must have been reasonably high due to her high level.</p>
<p>That’s why I didn’t think he was weak. However, there was almost no added effect from his skills, which gave him the impression of being a timid opponent, similar to how he looked when facing an opponent that had been leveled.</p>
<p>『Let’s move.』</p>
<p>「So fast!」</p>
<p>Adel suddenly moved instantaneously. No, he dashed forward. The fact that he was at its maximum speed without any preliminary movement means that even we could not catch up with him for a moment.</p>
<p>A slash from a super-fast movement that didn’t even leave a shadow. With that, the antidemons’ vanguard was annihilated. With just one swing, nearly 500 antidemons were split up and down, and they would have disappeared.</p>
<p>Fran would be faster at maximum speed when she becomes a Divine Beast. However, the other abilities are completely superior to her.</p>
<p>He also possessed several high-level skills and was making good use of them. That super-speed movement without any preliminary movement would only be possible with that.</p>
<p>What was even more terrifying about this guy was that he could stay in this state for a long time. Diaz also said that he could stay open for up to half a day.</p>
<p>Simply put, Ashwrath’s fighting ability may be better when he’s freed from Gaia. However, Alpha’s ability to fight for an extended period of time without needing to go out of control would be more troublesome in times of hostility.</p>
<p>『This is not the place to be called a Divine Sword after all...』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
