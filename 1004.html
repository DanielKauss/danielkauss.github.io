</div><h1>Chapter 1004</h1><p>A band of gougs and flames were erupting from the entrance to the core, as if it was a super-sized flamethrower.</p>
<p>Isario among the nuclear weapons exploded on a large scale. A large amount of flames, which could not fit into the small room, must have escaped into the passage and began to erupt.</p>
<p>A moment after the flames, a figure came out. Isario was definitely the one who was tumbling on the ground.</p>
<p>She rolled the ground several times as if she had evaded the attack.</p>
<p>No, in fact, she must have evaded the attack. As if chasing after Isario, a figure of hers came out through the burning flames.</p>
<p>So it wasn’t Mertlette. It was the antidemons. Where did they come from?</p>
<p>He looked more like a larger swordsman-type and was about two meters tall. However, his entire body was bright red and his horns were gold, which I had never seen before.</p>
<p>And the mana and evil contained in it was so overwhelming that it made me tremble. It was far stronger than the giant antidemons we had seen in the past.</p>
<p>His eyes turned toward us, a few dozen meters away. He entered into his range. Knowing this, Fran’s back muscles trembled slightly.</p>
<p>If we move badly, that alone would be dangerous. That’s how strong he is.</p>
<p>『This makes it harder for us to escape...』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Isario shouted to Fran, who had hesitated whether she should fight or run away with all her might.</p>
<p>「Let the dragonkin girls escape! I’ll stall them!」</p>
<p>Isario’s face was unmistakably impatient. This red-golden antidemon was so nasty that he had to give it such a look.</p>
<p>Isario shouted and emitted killing intent, trying to draw the attention of the antidemons. However, the antidemons’ eyes did not come off as they were fixed on us.</p>
<p>More precisely, they were staring at Velmeria and Frederick. Were they really trying to target Velmeria and Frederick?</p>
<p>「For us!」</p>
<p>「Gwoogh!」</p>
<p>Isario struck the antidemons with the flames of feint, but they were erased with the help of his arms.</p>
<p>No matter how Isario tried, it would be hard to deal with him. It would be a challenge to win without releasing the Divine Sword.</p>
<p>「Urushi! Let everyone escape!」</p>
<p>『Fran! Are you going to fight?』</p>
<p>「Isario has released his Divine Sword many times already. It would be dangerous if he can’t use it any longer」</p>
<p>Urushi, take Velmeria and Frederick to the next floor!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Perhaps sensing that they were about to escape, the antidemons packed them up at once. They were fast, but not to the point of being wary and losing sight of them.</p>
<p>With Fran’s parry and my telekinesis, I managed to deflect the antidemon attack. There was no way I could expose such an opening in front of an S-ranked adventurer.</p>
<p>「Don’t ignore them!」</p>
<p>「Gugaaa!」</p>
<p>It was slashed by Ignis and the antidemon was flicked right next to it. It was a threat to not taking any serious wounds from the slashes of the Divine Sword, but it must not be without damage.</p>
<p>As expected, I was keeping an eye on Isario. In the meantime, Urushi increased his speed, becoming a grain in no time. If we could get this far away from him, he wouldn’t be able to catch up with us anymore.</p>
<p>「Trismegistus and the girl?」</p>
<p>「I don’t know the bastard of Trismegistus. He didn’t move at all, so he decided to stay put. The robe――will be coming.」</p>
<p>With Isario’s words, a new figure appeared from the passageway. It was the robe girl, Merit.</p>
<p>「...Did you let him go?」</p>
<p>She stared hatefully in the direction Urushi ran away.</p>
<p>「It’s a pity, huh? The dragonkin girls are far farther away.」</p>
<p>「You did it for me. But that’s fine. I wanted you to die in this awful place, but it doesn’t change the fact that you’ll kill him in the end」</p>
<p>「What are you going to do?」</p>
<p>「You think you’re gonna say it?」</p>
<p>「Well, I wonder... why don’t you secretly tell me one guy who has been getting a little sad lately? I still don’t know your name though」</p>
<p>「Hmm. Listen to me, I’ll tell you before I kill you. My name is Meritte Wisteria, a pitiful descendant of the poor dragonkin who had been defeated and chased on this continent by the foolish dragonkin! And those who have been robbed of their families by the dragonkin! My only goal is to eradicate the evil dragonkin and those who have no value for them, and destroy their ancestors and families!」</p>
<p>Meritte gave a wry look at Isario’s words and cheerfully sang out her name and purpose.</p>
<p>「Avenger?」</p>
<p>「Why don’t you scold him with a familiar face, that he won’t take revenge for anything, or that he’s just empty?」</p>
<p>「I can’t believe she was able to do that. But I can’t stop those who are after her for revenge. I just thought it was too much trouble」</p>
<p>Even though we had a conversation, Isario did not look away from the antidemons.</p>
<p>「Meltrite-san. Can you control those antidemons? On the contrary, it looks as if you created one from the core.」</p>
<p>「Yeah, that’s right」</p>
<p>After coming so far, Meritte nodded her head broadly, perhaps not intending to hide it. It seems that the red-golden antidemons are specially made from nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>「Hee~? How?」</p>
<p>「You think you’ll teach me?」</p>
<p>I guess he didn’t look like Isario. But to me, he was faintly visible like the evil thread that connected Meritte’s cruciform magic sword to the red-golden antidemons.</p>
<p>A cross-shaped magic sword capable of manipulating evil energy, and Wisteria’s evil spirit leader that acted on evil energy in the same way. They were probably interfering with the Abyss Eater’s core by combining them.</p>
<p>「Okay then, you’re about to die, can you?」</p>
<p>Immediately after Meritte muttered this, the antidemons began to move with a jump, targeting Isario.</p>
<p>He must be trying to defeat it from his strongest enemy, Isario first. In other words, he thought that Fran would be able to deal with it on her own.</p>
<p>She was the one who licked her lips.</p>
<p>『Fran. Leaving the antidemons to Isario, we’ll be dealing with Merritte.』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
