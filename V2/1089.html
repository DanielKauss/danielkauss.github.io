</div><h1>Chapter 1089</h1><p>『Phew!』</p>
<p>(Master!)</p>
<p>『Whoa! W-What’s wrong, Fran?』</p>
<p> As soon as she came back from the white space, Fran suddenly hugged me. A large number of tears were build up in the corners of Fran’s eyes as she was squinting her cheeks. What’s wrong suddenly? </p>
<p>(I’d like to stay with Master forever. Because I’m her partner)</p>
<p>『Do you know that it was a white space?』</p>
<p>(Nn. The Goddess of Chaos will show me)</p>
<p>『Seriously!』</p>
<p>『Seriously!』</p>
<p>Is this the reason for that mischievous expression!? </p>
<p>(Master, thanks)</p>
<p>『Fran.  We’ve been together forever』</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
<p>  Aah, the old men were looking at us with strange looks. When I thought I had defeated the dragon, they suddenly began to hug it with their sword on its corpse, so it couldn’t be helped.  </p>
<p>『Master』</p>
<p>『Fenrir-san! How should I put it...』</p>
<p>『I’m fine.  More importantly, me and Announcer-san have not fully recovered yet.  We’ve also got some system updates.  It’s up to the Goddess, but I’m gonna sleep for a while again. I’ll leave Fran and Urushi to you in the meantime』</p>
<p>『Yeah.  Of course』</p>
<p>『Then, see ya』</p>
<p>  Fenrir-san’s presence then sank deep into me again. I guess I fell asleep again. In exchange for fulfilling my selfishness of staying here, I deprived Fenrir-san of her awakening and Fran of her opportunity to get a Divine Sword.  I’m sure both of them would tell me not to worry about it, but I can’t just be content with it.  I have to do my best for the two of them.  </p>
<p>『Fran. Let’s meet up with the old men for now』</p>
<p>(Nn! Okay!)</p>
<p>  Fran jumped off the corpse of the mountain dragon and spoke to Gwad. He had already been healed and it seemed that there were no wounds on her, aside from her armor.  </p>
<p>「What are we going to do now?」</p>
<p>「Huh?  Ooh, maybe in the future?  Yeah」</p>
<p> Gwad’s eyes were wide open to Fran, who had behaved as usual, as if she had never hugged a sword. But now she must have remembered that post-war treatment was important.  After all, the main topic was what to do with the corpse of the mountain dragons. After all, there was no one else moving anymore except us. I searched around for signs of scouts and guards, but there were no signs of anyone in the range that Urushi and I could detect.  </p>
<p>「I don’t need any other materials as long as you have more tongues, meat, and bones, okay?  Oh, and it’s best if you have those too」</p>
<p>「I’d like a brain and a heart! The horns are kinda hard to throw away too!」</p>
<p>「Then I’ll use scales!」</p>
<p>「Wait a minute and you’ll have Fran with me!」</p>
<p> I’m arguing about a lot of things, but it’s better for me to give up this time.  </p>
<p>「I can get some meat for you」</p>
<p>「No, no, I’ve put a stop to it, so you can say that it worked best, right?」</p>
<p> Diaz said that, but I’ve eaten its magic stones.  </p>
<p>「It’s fine since I destroyed its magic stone」</p>
<p>「Hou? Is that the ability to erase its magic stone soldiers?」</p>
<p>「I knew it!」</p>
<p>  Eiworth was very interested in it!  It seems that he had half-estimated Gumdo. Nevertheless, he must have entrusted the last part to Fran to make sure that he could finish off the mountain dragons.  Thanks to that, I was able to reach my self-evolution, and I also got some skills. Well, I still can’t use the Earth Dragon Magic, Dragonshout, Dragonscale Steel Form, and Dragonblood Flow Skills that I’ve acquired.  Oh, Fran also got the title of </p>
<p>『Dragon Killer』</p>
<p>.  It seems that Announcer-san couldn’t do her job due to the Gods’ interference. But before she realized it, her job was already on the list.  </p>
<p>「We have lost my magic stones, so I don’t need any materials」</p>
<p>  Fran was muttering these lines in her stead. I wonder if a good adult would be willing to tell us to split the materials without worrying about it. But the old men were their own.  </p>
<p>「Then I’d like you to take good care of the files.」</p>
<p>「If you don’t need a little girl, your brain and heart will be mys!」</p>
<p>「I’ll get more scales for you! </p>
<p>「I’d like you to share your fangs with me too!」</p>
<p>  The four of them started talking about how to share their fangs.  Well, that’s fine though.  Thanks to that, they were able to evolve themselves. After the four of them were struggling on their share, Eiworth came up with something.  </p>
<p>「Okay!  You’ll need a decent magical tool to summon so much of them! If you want to bring it to me, I’m free to give you the materials!」</p>
<p>「Wait, the country should definitely show interest. You can’t give in as much as you want, okay?」</p>
<p>「In the first place, does there exist a magical tool to perform such a summon?」</p>
<p>「Is it more credibility than being said to be done by an individual?」</p>
<p> Certainly, it would be impossible to have a magic tool that could summon a monster on the level of a dragon, even if a sacrifice was necessary.  But we had an idea of who could do that. </p>
<p>「There’s an alchemist named Ansel working for the Western Duke」</p>
<p>「Oh?  I’ve heard of him before!  He’s an alchemist who came to know about ten years ago in the small southern group of nations. I’ve heard he’s doing some research on curses, so I remember」</p>
<p>「Cursing?」</p>
<p>「Yes.  I’ve been researching it because I’m also interested in it.  But it’s terrifying how inefficient it is.  So, I gave up.  The source of the curse is the power of the curse that stems from the negative emotions of living creatures.  It can be cursed by directing a curse that is not really strong by contract or cursing it. The curse that those who die while holding a grudge against the world have left is quite strong, but it is not very efficient because it requires a sacrifice」</p>
<p>「Ansel says he’s researching the Divine Sword」</p>
<p>「Hou?  Has he changed his direction a lot?  Well, it is not surprising that he does, since he may do the research at his request」</p>
<p>「But if there is such an alchemist in the world, does that mean there might be more impossible summonings in the future?」</p>
<p>「That’s bad then!」</p>
<p>「Alchemist Ansel, huh?  He seems to be a troublesome opponent」</p>
<p> This time, a soldier from the Kingdom of Shallus was used as a sacrifice, but in the Kingdom of Raidos, it would not be surprising if he would use slaves and people to summon magic beasts.  </p>
<p>「Hmmm.  Then, you should leave them with me! I wonder how to return them?」</p>
<p>「It doesn’t have to be you, right?」</p>
<p>「Yes, Eiworth. It should be handed over to the researchers of the country」</p>
<p>「Woof!Well, can I just store the dragonkin in my storage for now?</p>
