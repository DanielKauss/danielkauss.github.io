</div><h1>Chapter 1093</h1><p>A few days after he opened the item bag, he deposited the documents he found at Gamudo. He said that he used his Guild Master’s authority to send them directly to the King. That way, he wouldn’t be crushed in a bad place.</p>
<p>Today was our last day in Barbra. The government had sent soldiers and other personnel, and we had almost finished taking over the work.</p>
<p>We’ve been building up a field over the past few days. In addition to renovating the flats that had been crushed by the barrage, we also turned some of the empty lots into plains.</p>
<p>Of course, she didn’t do it on her own, but at the request of the feudal lord. Now that there was war, she wanted to get some food on her own. Just the meat of these mountain dragons was more nutritious than anything else.</p>
<p>We planted a vegetable that could be grown in a short period of time, similar to a twenty-day radish. The taste was subtle, but the nutritional value was apparently mediocre.</p>
<p>I’ve actually raised my tree magic to Lv4. I wanted to try out a spell called the GrowPlant, which lets plants grow rapidly.</p>
<p>We were able to harvest the Twenty-day Radish Modoki in just three days. Even we raised them had the growth potential to back down a little. The farmers who helped us were also scared of them.</p>
<p>Moreover, it seemed that instead of growing faster, their taste got messed up. I guess it meant that if they were forced to grow, there would be a backlash. Fran was at the level of being silent.</p>
<p>「But they could at least be used as meat walls, right?」</p>
<p>Since we had harvested a good amount of it, we would have been able to get a few days’ worth of food. We continued to use tree magic until my magic power was exhausted.</p>
<p>It should have tasted pretty good if it was for a few days’ worth of a big city like Barbra, wasn’t it? It tasted good, but I’m sure Felmus and the other cooking guild members would be able to do something about it. Mixing it with mountain dragon meat to cover it up.</p>
<p>The feudal lord offered to ask her if she could continue to do this, but Fran refused. It must not be a good idea to keep working on the field for too long.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, I didn’t dislike it, but the task of transforming it into a queen mode and creating a field with land magic and water magic was surprisingly interesting. Besides, I had created a field in-app when I was human. It was a rare experience to remember that.</p>
<p>Well, I soon realized that it was not a task suitable for Fran. It was the same for gathering medicinal herbs, but Fran was not very good at doing the same thing over and over. She didn’t have to worry about swinging her sword though.</p>
<p>But before we could do that, we had the last soup. If Fran was going to give it away at Barbra, that would be all we could do.</p>
<p>「Dragon Restaurant and Black Tail Pavilion’s collaborative dish, Dragon Restaurant Curry!」</p>
<p>「It’s delicious! Doo~!」</p>
<p>「Let me give it to you for free!」</p>
<p>We also had the receptionists of the Adventurers Guild help us to distribute the curry to various places in Barbra.</p>
<p>Moreover, as the receptionists said, it was a special curry that they made in cooperation with Fermus.</p>
<p>Using mountain dragon meat that Felmus had dismantled and the soup stock he had taken from the dragonkin, this was a full-fledged curry made with spices I had blended.</p>
<p>Fran was silently shoveling in three bowls of it. They were using dragon meat, and Fermus and I were getting serious.</p>
<p>They should have distributed it outside of here, but it seemed that it was a big success everywhere.</p>
<p>「Hey, you’re the girl from the Black Tail Pavilion, right?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Thank you for the meal again!」</p>
<p>「You really are a great help!」</p>
<p>We also gave them curry bread during the previous incident, and it seemed that many of them remembered that time.</p>
<p>He bowed his head many times, and then asked to shake Fran’s hand again and again. This time it was especially popular that it was free, so I guess they would appreciate it even more.</p>
<p>Apparently, Gamudo seemed to have given Fran some time to spare in order to make some achievements. Before she knew it, she had hunted a dragon for Barbra and was treating her as a kind-hearted black cat girl who was giving it away for free.</p>
<p>It’s a bit too much, but it’s not enough to deny it...... In the end, she just left it like that. Fran looks a little frustrated though.</p>
<p>For that matter, I’ll serve you a delicious curry, so please forgive me.</p>
<p>After Fran finished giving them everything, she ate the curry while looking down at the square from the roof of the guild. There was a strong resentment on Fran’s face as she stared at the people while her legs were flipping.</p>
<p>Seeing the smiles on the faces of the people must have reminded her of her anger at the Kingdom of Raidos. However, Fran’s lack of respect was lessened by Urushi, who was eating curry next to her.</p>
<p>「Arf!」</p>
<p>「Urushi, is it tasty?」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>As I promised, they were now serving an all-you-can-eat super spicy curry.</p>
<p>Even Fran had already eaten a bowl of the curry that was so bright red. Her face was bright red rather than her mouth, but she had already given up on cleansing. You’ll get dirty from the corners of the curry that you want to clean, so it’s best to wash it all at once after you finish eating it.</p>
<p>Seeing Urushi, who was swinging his tail and chewing the curry in a good mood, seemed to have helped her relax. Fran then smiled slightly and stroked his body.</p>
<p>『Fran. I have over 200 self-evolution points, but is there any skill I want to level up? I can raise it as much as I want right now, okay?』</p>
<p>「Ooh, then, Cursed Magic and Purification Magic!」</p>
<p>『Both of them have nothing to do with that battle, are they okay?』</p>
<p>「Nn! With those two, I can save those who are being sold into slavery!」</p>
<p>『I see. Got it! Let’s put the arcane magic and the purification magic at bay!』</p>
<p>I’ve grown both my Cursing and Purification Magic to LvMax.</p>
<p>《Cursed Magic has reached LvMax. Cursed Magic Enhancement has been added to her skill. Fran has earned the title and the Cursed Magician》</p>
<p>《Purification Magic has reached LvMax. Holy Purification Magic has been added to her skill. Fran has earned the title and the Purification Magician》</p>
<p>Even after I cooked two skills, I still had 200 self-evolution points. I could let her cook other magic, but even if she raised her skill level too much, she wouldn’t be able to use it to its full potential.</p>
<p>I guess we should take our time and raise it little by little.</p>
<p>I knew it was powerful, but to think it was a failed divine sword!</p>
<p>「Nn. Okay」</p>
<p>I’ll give a reckless answer when push comes to shove!</p>
