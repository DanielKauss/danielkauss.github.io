</div><h1>Chapter 1036</h1><p>『I’m not the only one who’s changed, you know? Both Fran and Urushi have leveled up.』</p>
<p>(Oooh!)</p>
<p>(Woof!)</p>
<p> Such a fierce battle. It’s such a formidable foe. I wondered if only one thing ever got higher, but after fighting in large numbers, Fran’s level exceeded 70%. In fact, the average low-level and mid-level antidemon equivalent was tens of thousands――or even hundreds of thousands of experience value for that one person. In fact, when we heard the stories of the surrounding adventurers, we found that there were quite a few who had leveled up more than 10. In fact, when we listened to the stories of the surrounding adventurers, we found that many of them had leveled up more than 10.  In the future, it would take Fran a terrifying amount of experience to level up. Besides, the quality of our enemies may be important.  I don’t know how much we’ll have to defeat if we’re just goblins anymore. There was even a possibility that we wouldn’t get much experience if we weren’t good at it.  In the future, it might be more important to hone our skills than our levels. In fact, it was not just her level that Fran gained this time. Not only was she blessed by the Beast Bug God, but she had acquired several skills that were difficult to obtain in a short period of time unless she was placed in an extraordinary situation.  Of course, the battle on this continent was not the only reason. The various fierce battles that had taken place since Fran first met me had made Fran develop these skills.  Also, skills such as teleportation, kicking, morale enhancement, and equilibria were skills that she had lived up to her experience.  Her blinking skills had reached their max level, and a new high-level skill called ‘Sudden Movement’ had sprouted. Her agility has been honed.  Her stats hadn’t increased as huge as when she rose from 69 to 70%. That must have been the result of the combination of the effects of the Divine Beast Transformation and the bonus at a good level of kiri.  Even so, my HP and MP stats had increased by more than 100, and my agility had increased by about 70%. Thanks to this, the number of stats had exceeded 1000.  All the other stats had also increased by about 30-40.  As I thought, the increase in stats from the 70 level seemed to increase without any major mistakes and become stronger rapidly. It must have been quite a struggle to raise the level.  I also got a title.  Its name was </p>
<p>『The Despicable Beast of the Divine Beast』</p>
<p>.  It was a title given to those who were able to sense the blood of the Divine Beast flowing through their body. The effect was vague, as her instincts as a Divine Beast were strengthened. I didn’t understand that, but it might trigger her Divine Beast Transformation.  But you know, this title definitely has the Beast King, right?  And yet, I couldn’t appraise it when I saw it before. After all, she probably didn’t have any high-ranking skills or titles.  So, the various people I’ve seen in the past may not actually have some important skills or titles. Can I see them now?  Urushi was also at the level of 71, and each status had increased to more than Fran’s.  This was probably a trait of a magic beast. HP and the like had gone up by 250.  Compared to her stats like that, her skill growth was not that great. Unlike human beings, he probably didn’t remember much of his skills.  If he lost to the magic beast in terms of skills and status, he would lose to the humans in no time at all.  However, he had acquired the skills to transport and be indomitable.  Was it because he had carried so many people on his way? Fran must have been inflexible because she had gone through a tough battle just like Fran. </p>
<p>『But still, you two are at the same level as the Beast King we appraised when we first met, huh?  In Fran’s case, her stats were evenly matched.  On the contrary, Amanda’s stats were completely greater than hers. Was there a difference in race?  No, even though we didn’t see her title, we don’t know how reliable her level or status is.No, I don’t know how reliable that level or status is, considering that we didn’t see any titles.  Even so, there was no doubt that Fran had come a step closer to the world of the strong.  It was only with Fran’s efforts that she was able to reach this level in such a short time.  Well, I will admit that even I was great. But no matter how strong I was, it was Fran who would wield it.  The result was only possible because of Fran’s hard work.  However, I was also worried about it.  It was a skill.  Even though I had physically lined up with Beast King Rigdis </p>
<p>(probably)</p>
<p>, it was only a matter of numbers.  The only problem was that she was inferior in terms of skills and had completely lost in experience.  Rigdis was the Spear King, a skilled magician, and an experienced hero.  Neither Fran nor I has gone that far yet. If we fought head-on, we would easily lose. Was it better to praise him for standing in line with the Beast King right now, or was it in Fran’s best interest to warn him that we were still a long way off...?  </p>
<p>(Master?)</p>
<p>『Yeah, I think Fran’s level is on par with the Beast King』</p>
<p>(Hmm?)</p>
<p> When I said that, Fran frowned.  </p>
<p>『What’s wrong?』</p>
<p>(Even if they have the same level, I’m losing at all.  You shouldn’t be happy with it)</p>
<p>(Woof)</p>
<p>『No, no, you’re just equal in status, you know?』</p>
<p>(That’s still no good.  I can fight with Master.  But I can’t win on my own. I’ve lost both my skills and experience.)</p>
<p>  Fran seemed to have come to the same conclusion as me. She looked frustrated.  </p>
<p>(Even if I only leveled up, my skills hadn’t grown. </p>
<p>『No no, no!  That’s no better than a nobleman!  The Beast King has been fighting for decades, so it’s no wonder he’ll lose. One day, he’ll catch up with us.』</p>
<p>(Nn.  I’ll do my best.)</p>
<p>(Woof!)</p>
<p>(Woof woof!)</p>
<p>  There was no way Fran and Urushi could become a tentacle just because they got a little stronger.Fran seemed to have come to the same conclusion as me. She had an expression of frustration. </p>
<p>(Even if I only leveled up, my skills have not grown. Just like a nobleman with power leveling)</p>
<p>『No no no! That’s no match for me! I’m better than the nobles! The Beast King has been fighting for decades, so I can’t blame him for losing. One day, he’ll catch up with us.』</p>
<p>(Nn. I’ll do my best.)</p>
<p>(Woof!)</p>
<p>(Woof woof!)</p>
<p> There was no way Fran and Urushi could become a tentacle just because they got a little stronger. In fact, they were so strong that I was worried that they might push themselves too hard.</p>
