</div><h1>Chapter 1003</h1><p>The evil energy she released was canceled out, and the girl’s expression of astonishment appeared on her face. The fact that she had the power to manipulate evil energy was often clothed in powerful evil energy like fiends and evil dragonkin.</p>
<p>Isario must have been surprised that Fran, who didn’t seem to think so, had manipulated the Evil Spirit. But then, Isario started to move.</p>
<p>「Let’s beat them up and ask them what more info...!」</p>
<p>「Oh, you’re as barbaric as a dragonkin, aren’t you? The woman shouldn’t have any trouble with this, right?」</p>
<p>「You’ve grown up pretty bad, huh!?」</p>
<p>Isario swung Ignis up. What surprised me was the girl’s courage to stand in front of the pressure and chit chat. She didn’t even look panicked.</p>
<p>The girl smiled thinly, but Isario struck with flames. The flames of the Red Lilies seemed to have swallowed that little body――but just before, they had been blocked by a wall where flames couldn’t be seen. Though he was holding back quite a bit, it was the flames of Ignis, right?</p>
<p>「Tsk! Just focus on your attack! Miss!」</p>
<p>「Nn! Urushi!」</p>
<p>「Huh!」</p>
<p>She seemed to have realized that the girl in her robe was no ordinary opponent just from her attack and defense now. Isario then blocked the path between us and the girl in order to let Fran and Urushi escape.</p>
<p>They must have thought that Fran was at a disadvantage in the presence of anyone in the way. Fran carried Velmeria and Tilanaria on her shoulders, while Urushi sucked Frederick’s collar and aimed for the entrance.</p>
<p>But neither Fran nor Urushi could leave the room.</p>
<p>「Mrgh?」</p>
<p>「Uwaah!」</p>
<p>『What is this?』</p>
<p>「Huh?」</p>
<p>There was an invisible wall at the entrance. Fran and Velmeria frowned as they struck their foreheads. It was probably the same as when they had blocked Isario’s flames earlier.</p>
<p>It might be similar to Seliadot’s wards. It’s harder to detect, but at the same time, it’s pretty tough. Fran didn’t budge when she gave it a kick.</p>
<p>Fran then pulled back her feet again and held her up.</p>
<p>「Let’s get serious!」</p>
<p>『Do you want to use the divine attribute?』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>I guess she still couldn’t perfect the Divine Attribute in an instant. However, she seemed to be able to handle it at her own will for sure.</p>
<p>「Mrgh.」</p>
<p>『What’s wrong?』</p>
<p>「I think it’ll work out earlier」</p>
<p>It was probably thanks to the blessing of the Beast and Insect Gods. After a few seconds of accumulation, I could feel a faint divine attribute on Fran’s legs.</p>
<p>「Phew.........! Hah!」</p>
<p>This time the barrier shattered easily. Rather than being so powerful, it seemed to be the effect of the divine attribute.</p>
<p>「That’s crazy! I’ve heard that you can even withstand a single blow of extreme magic!」</p>
<p>『Fran, Urushi! Let’s go!』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Wait!」</p>
<p>「Lady in a robe. You’re dealing with me.」</p>
<p>Isario attacked and interrupted the mysterious pursuit of the robe girl. Unlike before, this was a serious fire with the Divine Attribute in it.</p>
<p>「You’re breaking the wards too? Already! You’re so annoying!」</p>
<p>The girl let out an annoyed voice, but no screams. She got hit by Isario’s flames and was safe? No, her robe and a part of her skin were burned. Unlike her appearance, she seemed to be quite tough.</p>
<p>And finally, the appraisal was slightly similar to that. That robe must have had a powerful concealment effect. Damage to the robe lowered the concealment effect.</p>
<p>His name was Meritte Wisteria.</p>
<p>Yes, it was Wisteria. It was one of the three Gordician families that lined up in Camellia and Magnolia, and according to Tzaluta, it was the most dangerous Wisteria in the world.</p>
<p>I understood why he hated dragonkin. After all, the dragonkin had destroyed him and robbed him of his Evil God Fragment.</p>
<p>And her race was the lorelei. She was originally a human, wasn’t she? But that’s what happens if she marries a lorelei again?</p>
<p>Now we know where that barrier was coming from, so I’m pretty sure it’s Seliadot. I don’t know where it is now, but it wouldn’t be surprising if the lorelei were to work together.</p>
<p>I was born several decades ago, it seems. Not that it means much to me considering how I don’t remember living that long myself.</p>
<p>The only problem was how much he was involved. Seliadot said she was tracking down an organization that was trying to illegal slavers. She must have been told that Georg was the culprit.</p>
<p>『I’m sure it made her realize that Seliadot wasn’t an enemy, but...』</p>
<p>I’m also curious to know what kind of skill Meritte had, the “Guide to Evil Spirits”. It seems that it was one of the three Gordician families’ special skills that allowed evil beings to go berserk, but I wonder if that was what allowed Georg to control them.</p>
<p>「Wait! Only the dragonkin won’t run away!」</p>
<p>「Then you’ll have to defeat me」</p>
<p>「Tsk!」</p>
<p>Sensing the presence of a battle beginning behind them, Fran and Urushi ran through the narrow passageway.</p>
<p>We returned to the huge underground hall where Trismegistus had shown off his power. Come to think of it, Trismegistus? We’ve only been silent for a while now...</p>
<p>「Velmeria, can you move?」</p>
<p>「Yeah...」</p>
<p>「What about Frederick?」</p>
<p>「I’m okay」</p>
<p>Frederick, who seemed to be on the verge of being controlled earlier, is not going to be a problem now. Should we get even further away from here?</p>
<p>「Let’s move. Please be a little more patient.」</p>
<p>Fran and Urushi pick up Velmeria and Frederick again and start moving. Then, a short distance away from the door leading to the core.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>『Uwah! What!?』</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>A tremendous explosion then reverberated through the air.</p>
<p>We hurriedly turned around, saw the door to the passageway between the nuclear weapons blown away, and flames overflowed with tremendous force from the passageway.</p>
