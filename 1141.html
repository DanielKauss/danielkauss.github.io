</div><h1>Chapter 1141</h1><p>「He’s dead!」</p>
<p> I’m filled with things I wanted to know, but there was no way I could ask. Roanes, the leader of the Zhu Flame Knights, turned his muzzle at us and attacked us without any further talk. I thought it was fire magic, but it seems that that ray of light-like snip was blocked by Khanne Flame’s bombardment. However, her attack was blocked by Mareficent and Persona. </p>
<p>「You don’t like impatient men, do you?」</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>「...Damn you!」</p>
<p>Damn shit!」</p>
<p>  Oops, he’s a beautiful young man, but he’s still nasty!  </p>
<p>「What the hell are you bastards!  Die, die, die!」</p>
<p>『This time a series of shots!?』</p>
<p>  Fire spheres were scattered like a shot gun.  Each shot was probably quite powerful. However, I couldn’t break the barrier that Fran, Mareficent, and Persona were working together to create.  </p>
<p>『First, neutralize them! Urushi!』</p>
<p>「Grrrr!」</p>
<p>「I know that!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  It seemed that they knew perfectly when Urushi would jump out of the shadows.  Their detection ability shouldn’t have been that great, but... I wonder if he’s been strengthened by his treasures?  Urushi, who had canceled out the bombardment with his right leg, crossed the shadows and came back.  He quickly put the Dark Embrace he had prepared on his leg, but it seemed that he couldn’t prevent it. The fur on Urushi’s right paw was burnt badly. It was proof that a single shot of the bombardment was as powerful as a high-level magic.  However, we still have the advantage of winning by the number of shots. Fran slashed at Roanes, who was able to break out of the moment by attacking Urushi.  </p>
<p>「Don’t come close!  The shitty brat!」</p>
<p>「Taaah!」</p>
<p>「Hah!」</p>
<p>  Even if she blocked Fran’s attack with her treasure, it wouldn’t leave a scratch.  As expected of a treasure, it’s tough! Though she wasn’t clad in Divine Power, Fran was serious!  Moreover, she evaded only a part of her body with flames and perfectly avoided the barrage of attacks. So, the trump card of the Raidos Kingdom was not “Dated” huh!?  However, the other side remained at a disadvantage. Roanes’ face contorted in anger, as if he had realized that we were stronger than he had expected.  </p>
<p>「Shit!  Shit shit shit shit! Only you bastards, I’ll definitely kill you!」</p>
<p>「Mwah!」</p>
<p>  My treasure had been transformed!  As if a slit-like sound had opened, several metal cords jumped out of it. The thin cords wriggled like tentacles and wrapped around Roanes’s arm.  I could see Roanes’s magic power flowing into the treasure through the cord. The gun blade then glowed in red.  However, because of this transformation, Roanes was still covered with openings. Fran didn’t miss it and attacked.  </p>
<p>「Haaaaaah!」</p>
<p>『CONSUME!』</p>
<p>  I could see that my sword blade was slightly enveloped in Divine Attribute mana.  I’m now able to master the use of the Beast Bug God’s blessing.  A divine swordsmanship imbued with divine energy. It was a blow that Fran could unleash without the use of Sword God Transformation or Potential Release, but it was also effective against strong opponents.  </p>
<p>「I’m sorry, kid!」</p>
<p>  Roanes seemed to have sensed the Divine Power. He didn’t try to get away with the flames and thrust out his free left arm.  It then collided with Roanes’s arm, which was clad in magic power, and my trajectory was slightly off. I guess he wasn’t going to catch it from the beginning, but he was going to parry it and avoid fatal wounds.  The slash, which was supposed to cut off his head, sliced the tip of his left elbow and cut his head in half. No, that was enough damage.  The wounds caused by the divine attribute slowed down her regeneration.  However, Roanes must have been prepared for that. Without stopping her movements at all, she thrust out a carmine Flame while staring at Fran.  </p>
<p>「Jeez!」</p>
<p> She exclaimed words filled with killing intent, sending a blood bubble flying from her mouth.  </p>
<p>『This is bad!  Fran!  Do your best to prevent it!』</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>  The ability of the Kingdom of Inflation Im, which I couldn’t see before. ■■■■■I could now see the part of her body. It said that it was not hidden, but it seemed that it couldn’t be used normally.  It seemed that it could only be used after sucking in the user’s magic power―― No, that’s not all. It seemed that it could only use magic power from the wielder―― No, it couldn’t be helped.  It seemed that it could suck in their magic power, their life force, and, if it was not for them, their life expectancy, and finally use it.  Divine Flame.  In other words, it might be an attack similar to Isario’s attack. There was no way I could underestimate them.  I fired a lightning spell to check him, but he all slipped through Roanes’s body.  Was he engulfed in flames again!? The wound on his neck was supposed to be a fatal wound, but his ability to judge him seemed to be still weak.  </p>
<p>「Bushbeeh!」</p>
<p>  Wasn’t he aiming for Fran?  Roanes pointed his muzzle to the sky and shot a bright red bullet high in the sky. No, was he aiming for everyone here!?  The bullets of divine flames burst like fireworks and came straight for the rooftop of the fort. Hundreds of divine flames rained down like rain.  </p>
<p>『Maleficent!  Persona!  Gather around Fran’s side!  Let’s all block it!』</p>
<p>「Let’s go to Persona!」</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>  I didn’t care and called out to Mareficent and the others because I didn’t want to protect them. Rather, I understood that we would need to work together to survive this rain of divine flames. At the very least, Fran and I would never be able to overcome it on our own.  I guess both of them decided that too.Aren’t you a God!?</p>
