</div><h1>Chapter 1084</h1><p>After parting ways with the old men, Fran landed in front of the magic stone soldiers with Urushi.</p>
<p>『Urushi, why don’t you just use the Bottomless Shadow to erase it?』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Master. Let’s go.」</p>
<p>『Yeah! It’s time for the full course!』</p>
<p>The magic stone soldiers didn’t say anything to us, but they clearly recognized us. The magic stone soldiers, who were about three meters tall, changed their movements.</p>
<p>An individual that seemed to be a vanguard came forward. Steel armor was in his hand.</p>
<p>Unlike before, it allowed me to appraise the abilities of the magic stone soldiers. Their stats were mediocre, but they were very tough. In addition to their simple high defense, they also had a barrier.</p>
<p>Also, maybe it was the ability of the magic stones that were the source of the attacks, the skills used for them were completely different. While the magic stone soldiers in the front had fire magic, sword skills, and presence detection, the magic stone soldiers behind them had skills for fist, blink, and jump.</p>
<p>Besides, she didn’t have any skills for arts or knowledge. Maybe useless skills were being whittled down.</p>
<p>「Let’s go!」</p>
<p>『Yeah!』</p>
<p>Fran slashes at him head-on.</p>
<p>「First of all! Bring it on!」</p>
<p>『Darya!』</p>
<p>Being a swordsman, the magic stone soldiers were about to take a slash. Their movements were smooth, and I didn’t think they were golems. The swords should have conducted a lot of magic power, and they were much better than most adventurers.</p>
<p>Moreover, I could feel his magic power rising at the same time. He must have been preparing magic. He was a golem addict and a high-level magic swordsman.</p>
<p>She blocked Fran’s slash and countered it with fire magic. Maybe that was her way of thinking?</p>
<p>But it was not.</p>
<p>「Yes!」</p>
<p>『Thank you!』</p>
<p>The slash that Fran unleashed proceeded as if there was no steel sword in there.</p>
<p>Steel swords would never be able to block me now. They probably didn’t even have the ability to measure the opponent’s fighting power or magic power. If it was an opponent who had a few eyes, they should have been able to sense the extraordinary magic power I was cloaking in.</p>
<p>Her slash went straight through both the barrier and the armor of the magic stone soldiers, leaving them with major wounds.</p>
<p>Unlike before, it didn’t seem to use Reflection Magic. In return, there were multiple wards of each attribute, but I was just like a paper in front of me now when I used both Divine Energy Manipulation and Evil Conquest.</p>
<p>『Haaa! My magic stone value is about 150! It’s the best prey I could get!』</p>
<p>「Master looks happy」</p>
<p>『It’s like a line of treats for me!』</p>
<p>However, there was something I was a little curious about. Compared to the magic stone soldiers we fought before, I got less magic stone value. As a result, I should have gotten around 300 magic stone value when I absorbed it in Barbra.</p>
<p>Besides, there was some kind of black mist clinging to us.</p>
<p>(This is......?)</p>
<p>『Fran, don’t cut through the barrier. This is a curse, and it’s laced with evil energy.』</p>
<p>It seems that a vicious curse had been placed inside the magic stone soldier’s body. Even if the magic stone soldier had been destroyed, this curse would probably be a two-stage plan to attack the destroyer.</p>
<p>I could feel the evil energy mixed in there, so the barrier was shaving off and thinning rapidly. The curse also turned the surrounding earth black.</p>
<p>Was all of these magic stone soldiers really that powerful? There’s no danger of a curse becoming too thick.</p>
<p>I remembered the time when I used a demon killer knife and tried to use a dismantling spell with Divine Attributes on it. The effect was just plain awesome.</p>
<p>The black mist-like cursing that was bathed in white light vanished completely without a trace, emitting a high-pitched scream. I couldn’t feel any evil energy, and the blackened ground was back to its original brown color.</p>
<p>Apparently, they were able to cleanse it.</p>
<p>Now I can prepare countermeasures against the curse! Let’s get serious!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Fran nodded enthusiastically and jumped into the ranks of――the magic stone soldiers. I see, so the magic stone soldiers were certainly strong.</p>
<p>The hardened vanguard moved around Fran, firing magic of various attributes without pause. It still engulfed their comrades, but the hardened magic stone soldiers could ignore the few shots.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a few magic stone soldiers in the back were showing an unusual increase in magic power. They seemed to be chanting powerful magic.</p>
<p>It was probably designed to beat even the strongest opponents.</p>
<p>But they were really bad.</p>
<p>Fran cut down the magic stone soldiers one after another, and I blocked the magic of the magic stone soldiers. The high-level magic that was finally released from the rear guard was also completely canceled by barriers and teleportation.</p>
<p>As about twenty magic stone soldiers became my prey, the movements of the magic stone soldiers changed. I had made up my mind to launch simultaneous attacks.</p>
<p>However, Fran showed no signs of slowing down in close combat and was absorbed by me one after another. The fact that she would disappear completely when I cut her down was probably a big mistake.</p>
<p>The advantage of launching simultaneous attacks is that they can use each other’s huge bodies to block Fran’s escape and catch up with her.</p>
<p>However, the magic stone soldiers disappear one after another, so I can’t surround Fran at all. That didn’t mean I could not limit Fran’s movements, and the speed at which she was defeated did not change. On the contrary, if I ran defenseless, I would only be prey to her.</p>
<p>Someday, the magic stone soldiers had started to keep their distance from Fran. Apparently, they were ignoring Fran and were trying to move forward. Maybe they were programmed to avoid threats in the event of any serious damage?</p>
<p>「...Not quite right, but something like that」</p>
<p>「Woooof!」</p>
<p>It was Urushi’s turn. He used his huge paw to deflect the magic stone soldiers toward us. Fran slashed at the magic stone soldiers who were blown away at a tremendous speed with a swing like a batter.</p>
<p>「Urushi! Follow me!」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>And so, when Fran and Urushi’s duo had killed nearly a hundred magic stone soldiers.</p>
<p>《The effect of self-evolution has been activated. 100 self-evolution points have been earned》</p>
