</div><h1>Chapter 1028</h1><p>「Black Lightning God’s Claw! Heavenly Judgment!」</p>
<p>Fran had succeeded in using the Black Lightning God’s Claw and Heaven Judgement at the same time. This was proof that she had completely controlled and used the magic power provided by Announcer-san.</p>
<p>She didn’t use the Sword God Transformation because she focuses on power. Of course, even if the blessing allows her to use the Divine Attribute, the Sword God Transformation is one of Fran’s strongest moves.</p>
<p>However, if we were just going to unleash an attack that focused on power against the big monsters, the Black Lightning God’s Claw + Heaven Judgement that allowed us to divert all of our power for attack was stronger.</p>
<p>That’s because with Sword God Transformation, I have to distribute my power to various places in order to make an optimized movement.</p>
<p>With my black lightning, I slashed through the space and approached the giant antidemons.</p>
<p>「Haaaaaaah!」</p>
<p>Before Urushi’s wounds could regenerate, Fran slashed at them at the same spot.</p>
<p>《Scanning through the body of the temporary named giant antidemon to obtain information on the failed divine sword. Success in contact with it.》</p>
<p>『Is this that cross-shaped sword?』</p>
<p>Inside the huge antidemon, I felt a different kind of magic power than itss. It was not somewhere inside, but rather as if it was mixed in with the whole thing.</p>
<p>Normally, it would be impossible to detect only the magic power of the failed divine sword from such a melting mixture. But now that we were in a boosted state by the bearer of hope, we were able to detect it, albeit faintly.</p>
<p>And as long as we knew our opponent’s condition, we could cut it down.</p>
<p>《Leave the control of the information to me》</p>
<p>『I’ve caught it!』</p>
<p>Thanks to Announcer-san, I was able to firmly grasp the magic power of the failed divine sword. My own detection ability was at full power, and due to the tremendous burden, my durability value was reduced all at once.</p>
<p>My blade reached the failed divine sword inside the giant antidemon. It was clearly slashing through it. That’s how convinced I was.</p>
<p>At the same time, Fran’s black lightning and my mana poured in directly from the blade, raging wildly, and the body of the giant antidemon disappeared from the inside.</p>
<p>『Uwooh? This is......!』</p>
<p>Maybe it was because I cannibalized two failed divine swords at the same time, magic power flowed into me like never before.</p>
<p>This is bad!</p>
<p>『Ghaaah! Ghaaah!』</p>
<p>《The flow of magic power will be controlled. The individual named Master should have a strong spirit》</p>
<p>『Guh...... Ghi......』</p>
<p>The flow of power was so enormous that it made me wonder if my contents had been jerked around.</p>
<p>『Ghaa!』</p>
<p>I’m trying to endure it, but I couldn’t stop screaming. It wasn’t pain. What should I say? Countless bugs have entered my body, wriggling loudly in my body and continuously screaming.</p>
<p>Anyways, the unbearable feeling kept attacking me.</p>
<p>『A-gah...!』</p>
<p>(Master? Master!)</p>
<p>『F-Fran......』</p>
<p>(Are you okay?)</p>
<p>Fran looked worried. What a look on her face. Well, I’d be worried if her partner suddenly started struggling.</p>
<p>What a pathetic. I felt a little uncomfortable, and I was tormented by something. What the hell is this, Master?</p>
<p>『Ha, hahaha... It’s just a shame. Spare, I’m sorry...』</p>
<p>(But.)</p>
<p>『What, it won’t stop immediately.』</p>
<p>(Nn......)</p>
<p>《7 seconds left until the magic control is complete》</p>
<p>Seven seconds. It looked like it was short, but it was surprisingly long for me. But I didn’t leak a trace of moaning anymore and just endured it.</p>
<p>Fran also thought that my condition had calmed down, maybe her expression had softened a little.</p>
<p>Gradually, thanks to the fact that my condition was subsiding, I had more time to worry about my surroundings.</p>
<p>The giant antidemons let loose a shrieking scream.</p>
<p>「Gyieeeeeee!」</p>
<p>That didn’t sound like a “destroyer”――or should I say, an antidemon.</p>
<p>It seemed that her power had dropped significantly and did not begin to regenerate instantly. However, even though she had lost most of her body and the power of the failed divine sword, she had not yet lost her magic power.</p>
<p>Even though it looked like the remains of a crushed building, the giant antidemon was still emitting powerful magic power.</p>
<p>(I failed to defeat it......)</p>
<p>『Yeah』</p>
<p>《With a 0% chance of the Great Magic Beast disappearing》</p>
<p>If we leave it like this, we are sure that it will resurrect. Fran, who had used up all of her magic power and could not defeat the giant antidemons, was sitting on the ground, staring at them in frustration at the wriggling antidemons.</p>
<p>I’m proud to say that she managed to inflict as much damage as a Divine Sword.</p>
<p>《A high burden has been generated due to the control and transformation of power obtained by the activation of the Cannibalism skill. The wear and tear of the Provisional named Announcer-san was much greater than expected. She was once again in a dormant state》</p>
<p>Eh? Wait! Announcer-san?</p>
<p>《Please use the individual named Fran》</p>
<p>「I want you to tell me about Dimitris」</p>
<p>《...》</p>
<p>It’s no good, huh? As usual, she’s so sudden!</p>
<p>I guess I won’t be able to get Announcer-san’s help for a while again. I feel like a big hole has been drilled through.</p>
<p>But we still had some leeway. After all, we still had a group of friends to rely on.</p>
<p>『We’re not the only ones here. Leave the rest to our friends.』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p>Fran turned her eyes to see Isario, standing there with a tremendous aura of Divine Power.</p>
<p>「Leave the rest to me」</p>
