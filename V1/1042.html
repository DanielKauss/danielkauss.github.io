</div><h1>Chapter 1042</h1><p>I somehow managed to explain my Divine Sword to Nadia. An hour has passed since we explained it to her.</p>
<p>We also talked about the Lyndovrum and the oratorium, but Nadia would be fine, right? In the first place, I’m sure it would spread the word among the many people we’ve met.</p>
<p>It seemed that Fran’s current excitement was similar to that of an elementary school girl who told her parents the secrets of her friends that she had learned at the academy by saying, “You shouldn’t tell anyone”.</p>
<p>Drulay then excitedly explained the awesomeness of each divine sword.</p>
<p>「That’s all the Divine Swords in one place, huh? I’m sure it was spectacular」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Besides, I didn’t know that there was only one failed divine sword. Maybe Master will be fine, but you should be careful, okay? It’s not like you’ll get carried away and make many mistakes if you suddenly gain great power」</p>
<p>『Yeah, I’ll keep that in mind』</p>
<p>I’d say she was in a state where both I and the others would recognize her. Besides, Nadia’s words that she used Overgrowth were very persuasive.</p>
<p>I’m sure she has failed in many ways too.</p>
<p>Well, it was the mercy of a warrior. I won’t ask him about it though.</p>
<p>「Did Auntie also fail?」</p>
<p>『Oh yeah! Listen to me!』</p>
<p>「Hahaha. That’s a lot. I wonder which one shall I tell you a little?」</p>
<p>As expected of Nadia, she was able to do something. She smiled at Fran’s rude words and told us interesting stories about the failures of herself and others.</p>
<p>Fran’s eyes sparkled as she listened to what she had to say. But it was no time for her to have fun.</p>
<p>As the sun began to set, the maid of the mansion told me that it was time. She shouldn’t stay too long, considering the burden on Nadia when she was sick.</p>
<p>They offered to stay at the guild, but I had no choice but to show up at the guild.</p>
<p>『Can I have one last shot?』</p>
<p>「What is it?」</p>
<p>『What does Nadia plan to do in the future? Will she stay on this continent? Or will she try to evolve?』</p>
<p>This is important. A poor attack could affect Fran’s future actions.</p>
<p>「Well, I’m going to be crazy about this continent after all. I can’t hunt evil people here, so I won’t keep my graves shut.」</p>
<p>It seemed that they were planning to evolve as well.</p>
<p>「Then you have me and――」</p>
<p>「It’s no good」</p>
<p>「Why!」</p>
<p>「I don’t want to pull you in. I’ve lost Overgrowth, so I’ve lost my footing.」</p>
<p>「No way. There’s no way Auntie has lost her footing!」</p>
<p>「I have. I know better than anyone else」</p>
<p>Fran said that was not the case, but actually, Nadia’s stats had been greatly reduced. That’s almost halved, probably due to the loss of Overgrowth and the drop in her level.</p>
<p>In Castel, Nadia’s level cap was higher than the Black Cat kin, but maybe it was the effect of her race returning to the Black Cat kin or something, her level had dropped to 45. The upper limit was for the Black Cat kin.</p>
<p>Many of their skills have been lowered and their equipment was broken in the battle for defense against Castel. Their strength used to be on the level of Rank A adventurers, but now it is probably somewhere between B and C.</p>
<p>She was one of the strongest pre-evolutionary black cats in her class, but nothing more. Moreover, she was not at full power right now. She shouldn’t be able to unleash her full power right now.</p>
<p>I’m sure Nadia knew that too.</p>
<p>「There are quite a few black cats on this continent. This is a land where you can live, as long as you’re prepared to fight. It’s a great training ground and it’s easier to move around than the other lands where the blue cats have the upper hand. I’m thinking of taking those guys and going to the Beast Kingdom. I didn’t know there was a village in the Black Cat kin, huh?」</p>
<p>Originally from a country other than the Beast Kingdom, it was hard to imagine there were any Black Cat Kin villages. Moreover, the entire country was protecting the Black Cat Kin and not being persecuted.</p>
<p>To Nadia, who had been mocked for being an inferior race ever since she was born and discriminated against by the other beastmen, shwartzkats may seem like an ideal country.</p>
<p>「The other black cats probably want to go too」</p>
<p>「Okay, I’ll go with you too!」</p>
<p>「Fran has accepted a request, right? Then we have to get back to report it. She’s an adventurer after all」</p>
<p>「......Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran’s selfishness was sealed when she was given full authority. She probably really wanted to go to the Beast Kingdom with Nadia after throwing away the request, but she would be offended if she said that.</p>
<p>I didn’t want Nadia to let down us, so Fran nodded reluctantly.</p>
<p>「Then I’ll be counting on Mea! Say hi to Auntie and Urushi! I’m sure they’ll take me to the Beast Kingdom!」</p>
<p>「Hmm? Are you okay? I don’t know how to behave well in front of the royalty?」</p>
<p>When Nadia heard Mea’s name, she scrunched in confusion. Well, it couldn’t be helped if she thought she was going to see the Beastman Princess.</p>
<p>This was a normal reaction. Well, Mea didn’t look like a princess, so she should be fine.</p>
<p>「Mea doesn’t mind」</p>
<p>「Well, you’re right」</p>
<p>「Mea is not a princess at all. She looks like a normal adventurer, so it’s no problem」</p>
<p>Aah, Fran also thought that Mea didn’t look like a princess. But most people would think that Fran didn’t know much about the nobility or anything like that, right?</p>
<p>「Well, I don’t know what’s going on, so I guess it can’t be helped... Alright! I’ve made up my mind! I’m eager to introduce you!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>『I don’t know if I’ll be able to do this today, but I’ll bring it with me once tomorrow』</p>
<p>「No, wait! I’m coming! There’s no way I can do such a rude thing if I call you!」</p>
<p>「No! Auntie can’t move yet!」</p>
<p>「Gnrgh......」</p>
<p>The continent of Gordicia was going to become more difficult in the future. It would be fine if we could bring Nadia and other black cats out of there.</p>
<p>「Aah, we have to ask Mulsani for at least some better clothes......!」</p>
<p>「Don’t mind being naked, Mea」</p>
<p>「I wouldn’t!」</p>
<p>What about Mea in Fran......?</p>
