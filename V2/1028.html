</div><h1>Chapter 1028</h1><p>「Black Lightning God’s Claw! Heaven Judgement!」</p>
<p> Fran had succeeded in using the Black Lightning God’s Claw and Heaven Judgement at the same time. It was proof that she had completely manipulated the magic power provided by Announcer-san and was making full use of it. The reason she didn’t use the Sword God Transformation was because she focused on power. Of course, even if she was able to use the Divine Attribute with her blessings, the Sword God Transformation was one of Fran’s special techniques. However, if she just unleashes a power-oriented attack on the big shots, the Black Lightning God’s Claw + Heaven Judgement, which can transfer all her power to attack, is stronger. However, if she just unleashes a power-oriented attack on the big monsters, the Black Lightning God’s Claw + Heaven Judgement, which allows her to use all of her power for attacks, is stronger.  With the Sword God Transformation, she has to allocate her power to various places to make an optimized movement. I, clad in black lightning, slashed at the giant antidemons while slashing through the space.  </p>
<p>「Haaaaaaah!」</p>
<p> Before the wound Urushi drilled could regenerate, our slashes were aimed at the same spot.  </p>
<p>《Scanning through the body of the temporary named giant antidemon and obtaining information about the failed divine sword.  succeeded in making contact.》</p>
<p>『So this is that cross-shaped sword?』</p>
<p>  Within the huge antidemons, I sense a different kind of magic power than its own. Rather than being somewhere inside, it’s more as if it was mixed in with the whole.  Normally, it would be impossible to detect only the magic power of the failed divine sword from such a mush. But now that we were in a Boost state due to the bearer of hope, we could distinguish between them, albeit faintly. And as long as we knew the condition of the other party, we could cut it. </p>
<p>《Leave the information under control》</p>
<p>『Captured!  Ooorgh!』</p>
<p>  Thanks to Announcer-san, I was able to capture the magic power of the Discarded Divine Sword. My own detection power was now at full throttle, and due to the tremendous burden, my durability value would decrease at once.  I could feel my blade reaching the Discarded Divine Sword in this huge antidemon.  It was clear that I had sliced through it. I was convinced of that. At the same time, Fran’s black lightning and I’s magic power poured in directly from the blade raged, annihilating the body of the giant antidemons from within.  </p>
<p>『Uooh?  What the hell is this...!?』</p>
<p>  Maybe it was because I couldnibalized two failed divine swords at the same time, more magic power then ever flowed into me.  This was bad!  </p>
<p>『Gugah! Gaaaaaaah!』</p>
<p>《The flow of magic power will be controlled.  Please make the individual named Master strong in his mind.》</p>
<p>『Guh... Gih...』</p>
<p>  The flow of power was so huge that it made me wonder if my inner self had been writhed around chaotically.  </p>
<p>『Gugaaaaah!』</p>
<p>  I tried to withstand it, but it didn’t stop screaming.  It didn’t hurt.  What should I say? Countless countless bugs had entered me, and I was writhing in my body and continuing to make an deafening voice.  Anyway, I was feeling unbearable. </p>
<p>『A-gaaah...!』</p>
<p>(Master? </p>
<p>『F-ra...』</p>
<p>(Are you okay?)</p>
<p>  Fran looked worried.  What kind of face was she? Well, yeah.  If my partner suddenly started to suffer, I’d be worried.  How pathetic.  It was just a little, and I was suffering from looking at it like this.  What’s with Master?  </p>
<p>『A-ahaha...  It’s a waste of resources. It’s kinda scary, isn’t it...』</p>
<p>(But)</p>
<p>『What, quickly, you’re all right』</p>
<p>(Nn...)</p>
<p>《7 seconds left until the magic control is complete》</p>
<p>  7 seconds.  It seemed to be short, but it was surprisingly long for me. But I endured it without leaking a piece of grunts anymore. Fran, too, seemed to think that my condition had calmed down a little, and her expression softened a little. Thanks to the fact that her condition was gradually subsiding, she could afford to be concerned about her surroundings. The giant antidemons screamed in screams. </p>
<p>「Giiiiiiiiiiii!」</p>
<p>  I didn’t call it the “terminal beast”―― but it seemed that its power had dropped drastically and did not start to regenerate instantly. However, they had lost most of their body, lost the power of the failed divine sword, but they still hadn’t lost their magic power. Even though he looked like the remnants of a shattered building, the giant antidemons were still radiating strong magical power. </p>
<p>(I couldn’t defeat it...)</p>
<p>『Yeah.』</p>
<p>《There’s 0% chance that the Great Magic Beast will disappear》</p>
<p>  If we just leave it like this, it was sure that it would resurrect. Fran, who had used up all of her magic power and couldn’t defeat the giant antidemons, remained slumped on the ground, staring at them in frustration. I would be proud to have been able to inflict damage on a level similar to that of a divine sword.  </p>
<p>《The control and transformation of the power obtained by the Cannibalize skill creates a high burden.  The wear and tear of the individual named Announcer-san was much greater than expected. He is going to go into a dormant state again》</p>
<p>  Eh?  Hey!  Announcer-san?  </p>
<p>《I’m begging you, the individual named Fran》</p>
<p>  Wait!  I’m filled with questions!  </p>
<p>《...》</p>
<p> No good, huh? As usual, it’s so sudden!  I guess I won’t be able to borrow Announcer-san’s help for a while again. It felt like a big hole had been made.  But still, we had plenty of leeway.  After all, we still had more reliable comrades.  </p>
<p>『We’re not the only ones here. Leave the rest to our friends』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p>「Leave the rest to me.」</p>
