</div><h1>Chapter 1060</h1><p>Each time Fran wielded me, several Raydossian soldiers lost their lives, and my spells turned people into firemen.</p>
<p>Fran, on the other hand, was only wearing out her magic power and not even as damaged as her fur.</p>
<p>It may look like a one-sided fight, but the quality of the soldiers was actually not bad. They were well versed in group battles. Perhaps they would excel at fighting against magic beasts that had some information about them.</p>
<p>This was a strategy that damaged the surrounding spears and archery troops while blocking their attacks with the vanguard.</p>
<p>And they also seemed to have mental strength. Many of the wielders seemed to be willing to risk their lives to defeat Fran.</p>
<p>But this time, the Raydoss soldiers were under too many bad conditions.</p>
<p>They were in a tight spot in the harbor, and they were unable to line up properly due to the fact that they arrived at the harbor separately. Moreover, the chain of command seemed to be in chaos.</p>
<p>Apparently, the commander we caught was the highest commander in this place. The battle began before we could take him over, so the chaos seemed to be continuing.</p>
<p>And the biggest problem was that Fran was way too strong.</p>
<p>「You can save her!」</p>
<p>「Gyiahhhh!」</p>
<p>「Mom!」</p>
<p>No matter how hard the Raidos soldiers pushed themselves, a single hit on their armor sleeve would cut the soldier down with tremendous force and send him flying. Attacks from Raidos’ side, on the other hand, would be completely ineffective. His evasive ability was also tremendous, and even if it hit, it would be easily repelled by a barrier.</p>
<p>As the number of soldiers increased, the number of casualties continued to increase.</p>
<p>The soldiers, who had been intimidating at first, were clearly starting to back down.</p>
<p>The corpse piled up everywhere in the harbor, and fish were swarming and pecking on the remains of their friends floating on the sea. The person who created the scene was a young black cat girl. The only girl who created the scene was crushed without an army being able to do anything. It must be a nightmare.</p>
<p>Finally, people began to scream and run away without preparing any weapons.</p>
<p>It didn’t matter if their superiors shouted that it was a violation of their orders. Then, starting with that, the number of people fleeing began to increase little by little.</p>
<p>However, a new force appeared on the Raidos Kingdom’s side. It was a large number of magical beasts.</p>
<p>At the front was a tiger-like magic beast. It was the Sneak Leo, a cat-shaped magic beast with excellent exploration ability. Just like the Lesser lock, it was probably introduced for security.</p>
<p>There were a few of four of them. There were also wolf-shaped magic beasts and cow-shaped magic beasts for carrying cargo.</p>
<p>「Grrrrr」</p>
<p>「Don’t look away! The target is that little girl!」</p>
<p>「Grrr...」</p>
<p>The men behind them must be magic beast users. They scolded the magic beast after seeing the corpse of the soldier with their whips.</p>
<p>Furthermore, small bat-like magic beasts were also gathering in the sky.</p>
<p>Now that the magic beast appeared as a reinforcement, some of the soldiers seemed to have regained their composure. Fran seemed to be completely encircled――.</p>
<p>(Magic beast, do you have a good magic stone?)</p>
<p>『Yeah.』</p>
<p>It was cute compared to a swarm of magic beasts or an army of antidemons of this level. For us, it was just like a magic stone came from the other side.</p>
<p>Within five minutes, he was kicked aside and he was back on the run.</p>
<p>No wait, they looked even worse than before. The soldiers, who had been shown the magic beast being annihilated without being able to do anything, were in a state that could even be described as crazy.</p>
<p>If we continued like this, we would be able to defeat even more soldiers. But we did not pursue them.</p>
<p>『They’re finally making their move!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>The Raydoss fleet was docked at Dards, causing the bombardment to begin.</p>
<p>It didn’t matter if they felt Fran was a threat or if they still had friends with them. The brave Raydoss soldiers remaining around Fran were blown away by the barrage.</p>
<p>Fran grazed the necks of the magic beast users and dragged them as she ran into the shadow of the earth wall I had created. The reason I brought in the magic beast users was to get information about them.</p>
<p>The magic beast user must have thought that he had been abandoned due to his exposure to shelling. Then, he blurted out his inner feelings.</p>
<p>Many of the residents of Dahz had escaped, but still, there were nearly 300 captives. The main ones were residents who failed to escape, sailors, soldiers and adventurers who fought in the rear.</p>
<p>Among them, healthy adults and children will be transported north by boat, and injured ones and old men will be kept in Dahz for a while.</p>
<p>However, it seemed that the adventurer we rescued was the first group to be transported, and no one had been aboard the ship yet. In other words, the ship of the Raidos Fleet docked at Dards was probably only filled with soldiers from the Raidos Kingdom.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the reason why the ships of the Sea Kingdom of Sydran were not there was because they were deployed to attack Barbra.</p>
<p>(Master)</p>
<p>Fran’s eyes were filled with motivation. Well, if we managed to destroy the Raidos fleet here, it would not only save Dards but also Barbra. They were completely ready for battle.</p>
<p>However, there were some concerns.</p>
<p>『...Maybe someone like Marl will join us again. If he were to force us to control him, would we be able to fight?』</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>Fran nodded her head with a look of determination. I’d much rather dodge another battle that could hurt Fran’s soul...</p>
<p>There was no way Fran would back down after coming all this way.</p>
<p>『Okay, let’s do it.』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>I tied up the magic beastman and left him in the shadows. If they were still alive after the battle was over, we could hand them over to the guild as a source of information. If they got caught up in the barrage――well, at that time. We were really bad luck.</p>
<p>As soon as I erased the Great Wall, Fran jumped out.</p>
<p>『First, let’s bring you a big one』</p>
<p>「Okay!」</p>
