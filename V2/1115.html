</div><h1>Chapter 1115</h1><p>After handing over the mysterious stick sword to Klimut, we immediately began our rescue. Klimut and his knights were on the move, but the more hands we had, the better. We went around the affected areas and rescued living people. Many were just barely rescued. Also, the number of casualties was less than we expected. This was mainly due to the fact that many former Marquis Ashtner’s men had been captured, and there were only a few people in the noble district, and those who remained had escaped into the basement. It was also thanks to the fact that many of the people who were originally under Marquis Ashtner’s command were captured, and there were only a few people in the noble district, and those who remained had escaped into the basement.  Once we had done some rescue, we would now deal with the enemy. Actually, Klimut had asked us to search and defeat the enemies that lurked in Alessa.  No, we should leave the search to Klimut and destroy them instead.  When the Hydman attacked us, the Great Spirit seemed to have remembered its magic power. And it had found out that several beings with the same kind of magic power were hiding in Alessa.  So, in addition to the item retrievers, there were even more Hydman there... Maybe they would think that there were ten of them if they saw one of them? Klimut didn’t move from the spot and instantly found the Hydman hiding in Alessa, so the ability of the Great Spirit to detect them was amazing.  It seemed that the Great Spirit was only around the size of a town. As a result, we followed the spirit’s lead and eliminated the three Hydman. Apparently, Hydman had the ability to split his mind, put it into multiple undead, and manipulate them at the same time. Since they were the same being, they could share their memories and abilities, but it seemed that their strength and skills would change depending on the body they inhabit and the size of the split.  What was terrifying was the ability of the Great Spirit to see through their abilities. With the ability to gather information about the Great Spirit, Klimut’s analysis, and appraisal, they could leave the other party completely unattended.  Even so, we didn’t know what the stick sword was. Hydman wouldn’t be able to open his mouth, and even the Great Spirit couldn’t give him any detailed information.  He had just made a contract with the Great Spirit, and his communication with the Great Spirit was not complete, and the reason why he was concerned about it was unclear. Even if he was talking to the Great Spirit, he was probably too exhausted to communicate for a long time. However, the spirits were strangely concerned about it, and the Great Spirit had forced Klimut to take it by force. In the end, we only came to the conclusion that we didn’t know much about it.  It would be safest if Klimut and the Great Spirit kept it in their custody.  Just like Hydman’s attack again, Klimut had regained his power befitting an A ranker. Even if Fran and I take him by surprise, we don’t know if we can defeat him or not.  The most important thing was probably Fran’s improved level of Spirit Magic. It seemed that her communication with the Great Spirit of Wind and Marl had been training her spirit magic.  The other harvest was the item bag that Hydman and the others had.  The item bag that Hydman and the others possessed was apparently under a contract with a very high-ranking magician, and it took a lot of time to open it. Well, it took a while to finally get it open though! Everything inside was the same, with a detailed map of Alessa and two magic tools.  The first was a dagger with Klimut stuck in it.  In addition to its magic power absorption ability, it was filled with evil energy. When the effect was activated, the evil energy was released all at once, creating an evil blade for only ten seconds.  I guess it is possible to gain considerable penetrating power by disrupting magic and barriers with evil energy. Klimut frowned, but it was an interesting item for me.  The evil energy coming from the Evil God Fragment was not a barrier, but rather a way to break our opponent’s defenses. But I didn’t want to use it that often.  Evil energy is a power that people hate.  That’s why I’ve been using too much evil energy lately.  The Beast Bug God had said that if I had a contract or permission, I could ask for help from the Evil God Fragment, but I’ll make myself a little heavier this time. It’s fine since Klimut was the one we were talking about this time, but it would be troublesome if someone bad witnessed me.And the other magical tool in our item bag was a magic tool like a compass to help us find people.  It seemed to only have a limited ability, and to my surprise, it was specialized in finding Klimut’s whereabouts.  No doubt, since all the needles pointed at Klimut.  They had been targeting him quite relentlessly. Not only did they hide their mysterious stick sword, but they were also one of the largest walls in Alessa’s attack.  If they could get Klimut out of control and let the great spirits go out of control, they would be able to make three or four beasts with one stone. He must have thought that it was worth creating a special magic tool.  </p>
<p>「Amanda, are you okay?」</p>
<p>『Hmm. From Raydoss’s point of view, it would be as annoying as Klimut...』</p>
<p>  As for Jean, an undead necromancer named Nameless was created.  So, what about Amanda? No wonder Fran was worried.  However, when she told Klimut about the same thing, she told him that she would be fine with a laugh.  </p>
<p>「Yeah, Amanda-kun is certainly a better person to protect their base than an attack... But you’ll be fine because she’ll be invincible during this war」</p>
<p>「Are they invincible during the war?」</p>
<p>「I’m overconfident, but Amanda-kun will be fine」</p>
<p>  There seems to be something.  It seems that she’s not just talking about her mentality, but she’s also strengthening her abilities. I guess the reason she doesn’t go into detail is because it was Amanda’s personal information.  </p>
<p>「More than that, you need to worry about yourself. You’re already a famous adventurer, aren’t you?」</p>
<p>「?  Really?」</p>
<p>  I’ve heard she’s been active in various places and has won the Ulmutt martial arts tournament.  I’ve heard that fleet crushing has just begun in Barbra. He’s a well-known celebrity now!  As a result, he’s crushed the conspiracy of the Raidos Kingdom, so it wouldn’t be surprising if we’d eyes on him.</p>
<p>「Anyways, don’t worry about yourself. You’re already a famous adventurer, aren’t you?」</p>
<p>「? Really?」</p>
<p> Now that you mention it, he’s right. He’s been active in many places and has won the martial arts tournament in Ulmut. I’ve heard that he’s starting to be called a crusher in Barbra. He’s a well-known celebrity now! As a result, he’s crushed the conspiracy of the Raidos Kingdom, so it wouldn’t be surprising if we’d eyes on him. I’ll be more careful with the surrounding area in the future.</p>
