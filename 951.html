</div><h1>Chapter 951</h1><p>Fran had heard from the Silver Lady about the Divine Sword. Next to Alpha, Berserk, Ignis, Gaia, Klisterus, and Tempest was the Knight of War, Charon. It had only a little information about this. It was in the shape of a commander’s staff and was said to be able to summon and control a variety of metal golems. </p>
<p>「It was about 5,000 years ago that I last saw Charon. At that time, an adventurer with the alias of a battalion was using it」</p>
<p> That’s when an adventurer with the alias of the battalion used it」</p>
<p>「Brigade!  I’ve heard of it!  The youngest S-ranked adventurer!」</p>
<p> Surely, he was an adventurer of long ago, with an A-ranked adventurer at the age of ten and an S-ranked adventurer at the age of fourteen.  As expected of Fran. She remembered the name of a strong adventurer.  To think she was the wielder of a Divine Sword... In other words, the alias of the battalion was probably because he was leading a golem corps? </p>
<p>「As far as I know, he was manipulating twelve different golems and kicking antidemons by himself.」</p>
<p> The sight of the silver-colored golems firing rays and metal bullets was truly worthy of being called the strongest army.  Or rather, it was completely a group of robot soldiers, wasn’t it? I can’t help but think that they were doing science fiction rather than fantasy like Charon.  </p>
<p>「rumors have it that they were out of control in Kaple.」</p>
<p> They don’t know the limit either.  However, since they couldn’t find any sign of eating, there was a possibility that their body was mutating.  So, if they used it, their body would no longer be human, maybe? It might be a price similar to Overgrowth. </p>
<p>「There was a very high price to pay for the Golden Dragon Sword, Eldorad.」</p>
<p>「Eldrad......  The Divine Sword that has already been destroyed.」</p>
<p>「I see.  Too little information from the outside.  Eldorad was a Divine Sword in the shape of a golden knight spear.  It was capable of summoning and using light dragons. It was a huge dragon of light, once it materialized, it would dye the earth a golden color.」</p>
<p>  That’s a ability similar to that of a kin of Lindwlm. The difference is that Lind is a fire dragon, while Eldorado is a light dragon.  </p>
<p>「The price is the life expectancy of the user. I remember that the more you use it, the more old you get, and Eldorad’s wielder dies very quickly.」</p>
<p>『Uwah.  Well that’s certainly a price too high.』</p>
<p>  So there was a price higher than that level.  But still, the divine sword was a divine sword.  It seems that there were a few people who would try to use it.  Therefore, while on this continent, there were more than ten substitutes for it. The restriction on the number of wielders apparently worked well with the sword, but it seems that many of them could be used on this continent, since there were many dragonkin. I guess that’s why they later leaked it out of this continent and destroyed it there.  </p>
<p>「...Rindwilm too, is it a price to pay for its life expectancy?」</p>
<p>「Rindwilm......  It’s the divine sword used in the defense of Sendia.」</p>
<p>  They had apparently observed that battle as well. She immediately mentioned that information.  </p>
<p>「Nn.  My friend is using it.」</p>
<p>  In Mea’s case, Sophie reached the divine sword release but she can’t use it anymore.  It will not be released again for a while. That’s why Fran didn’t seem to be too concerned about the cost of Mea, but she was probably suddenly worried when she heard that her life expectancy might have been reduced.  </p>
<p>「I don’t have any information on Lindwurm, so I’m not sure exactly. Do you know the creator of that Divine Sword?」</p>
<p>「Umm...?」</p>
<p>『Surely, he’s a Divine-level blacksmith named Fergo』</p>
<p>  That must have been on the list of what Lumina had shown us.  </p>
<p>「I see.  Eldorad’s creator is Ulmer. The price of using the Lindwilm must be quite different depending on the creator, so I don’t think that the price of using the Lindwilm will be a long-lived life span」</p>
<p>「I’m glad」</p>
<p>  Fran stroked her chest with a relieved smile. But the fact that Eldrad’s creator was Ulmer meant that the price of using Gaia and Ignis must be a long-lived asset, right?  No, Isario showed no signs of aging after using it, and even Ashwrath must have been using Gaia for a very long time. I don’t know exactly how long the demonkin’s life span would be.  Besides, if it was the price of life expectancy, Ashwrath would have killed himself on purpose. I guess that’s why the price was still around the level.  There were only two remaining. </p>
<p>「Recently? So, they’re still on this continent?」</p>
<p>「Unfortunately, they have already disappeared.  The Sanctuary was about seventy years ago, and Wisdom was about twenty years ago.」</p>
<p>  Golems had been on the loose for thousands of years, so they had been treating them as armor-type divine swords for about a hundred years now.  </p>
<p>「The Sanctuary was a rare type of divine sword with blue and white body, and at the same time, it seemed that armor was also created.  It had the effect of creating a holy area.  In this holy area, self and friends were super-strengthened, and enemies were weakened.  It was also thought to have the effect of granting shield kingship to it. It was used by the Knights of a country called Ilgistia」</p>
<p>  That was a country I had never heard of before.  Well, there were many continents and countries in this world. So, of course, many countries did not know about it.  </p>
<p>「What’s the cost?」</p>
<p>「The price of this Divine Sword is somewhat special, just like Wisdom we’ll talk about later.  I’m sure the creator is a Divine-level blacksmith too」</p>
<p>「The price?」</p>
<p>「I don’t know how much it’s a price, but its ability depends on the opponent」</p>
<p>  It was said that Sanctuary and Wisdom were set up so that their abilities would change depending on the strength of the other party’s evil spirit. Perhaps the creator of this Divine Sword valued the fact that it was a weapon against the Evil Gods.  It was their maximum power against the Evil Gods.  It was only about a tenth against evil people.  It was said that it was only a little stronger against other people and magic beasts. It might be a little better against antidemons that contain evil energy.  The remaining Wisdom’s abilities, the Wisdom Wisdom Skill, were still a little special.  After it was released, it was shaped like multiple orbs floating in the air. And when it was released, it was able to use all kinds of magic, increase magic power, accelerate thought, and use magic at the same time.  The Divine Sword itself had no offensive power, and was a Divine Sword that could be strong and weak with the skill of the user.The Divine Sword itself had no offensive power, and was a Divine Sword that could be both strong and weak with the skill of its wielder. If a magician were able to detect their opponent’s weaknesses and instantly use magic, they would be able to demonstrate their unrivaled strength. However, he had never shown his true power on this continent, so even the Silver Lady had never seen its true power before. Wisdom, like the Sanctuary, was a type of Divine Sword that could be used for healing and defense. I guess she was the same creator.</p>
