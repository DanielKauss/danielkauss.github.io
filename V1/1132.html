</div><h1>Chapter 1132</h1><p>The original plan for the Raidos Kingdom’s invasion was greatly disrupted. In particular, almost all the operations that the Western Duke had been working on had been canceled, so we could not expect any support from him.</p>
<p>When we asked him about it, we found out that about eighty per cent of it was our fault.</p>
<p>We only fought hard to resist Raidos, but I never thought that he had accidentally inflicted a huge damage on the Western Duke... I was completely unaware that he was going to curse him back.</p>
<p>That’s why the Southern Duke purposely planned a strategy to draw the Kranzel army into their country and strike them.</p>
<p>On the way there, we surrendered to the Kingdom of Kranzel without resisting, secretly gathering information and passing it on to the hands of the Southern Duke.</p>
<p>And so, they decided to completely strip the strength of the Kingdom of Kranzel’s forces and join forces with the Southern Duke’s forces, the Black Skeleton Army, and the Crimson Flame Knights to destroy it. Naturally, the Black Skeleton Army also brought in top-ranking people as well.</p>
<p>I mean, I was expecting Avengers to be summoned too.</p>
<p>「Well, we’ve lost control of it, so you won’t be summoned」</p>
<p>The Black Skeleton Corps had a ritual magic that summoned and returned the undead at once, and if they used it, the surprise attack could be launched as it pleased. It had just been developed and was still under test in actual battle, but it was said to be working fine.</p>
<p>The undead army that attacked the town of Alessa was the product of a trial.</p>
<p>「No matter how strong the army of the Kingdom of Kranzel is, this time it will be impossible. It seems that they are divided into three groups, and each of them will be defeated」</p>
<p>「...Let’s go!」</p>
<p>『Okay, what are we gonna do here? Leave the warriors behind?』</p>
<p>If we leave them here, the rank-up exam might be disqualified, and if we leave only the brave soldiers behind, they might be annihilated. After all, it was an enemy area.</p>
<p>I thought about leaving the ghouls as my escort, but I don’t know what would happen to their control if I leave them. Will they protect me with Mareficent? I guess they just saw through my idea.</p>
<p>「Taking care of a valiant soldier is no small chore.」</p>
<p>「Mrgh.」</p>
<p>It was as easy-going as ever, but it was somehow so powerful that I couldn’t let anyone say no. I doubt we can rely on him.</p>
<p>That’s when I realized something. If we now have a little more than 70% army, including ghouls, and another 30 people, could the March of the Valkyrie be activated?</p>
<p>「Hey, Avenger」</p>
<p>「What is it! My priestess!」</p>
<p>「Can you call it an undead with fast legs?」</p>
<p>A few hours later. The march had become nothing short of fierce.</p>
<p>We cut through the grass, climbed the steep slope one step in front of the cliff, and continued to walk along the path without a path. Moreover, we continued to run for a long time.</p>
<p>She was constantly breathing hard, her limbs scarred from rubbing, and her muscles screamed. Anguished voices and 「Wooooh! Curry!」 continued to leak out of her mouth.</p>
<p>Well, the stepfathers were no ordinary warriors though.</p>
<p>Fran, Mareficent, and Avenger all had calm faces.</p>
<p>「A little more. I’ll do my best.」</p>
<p>「Chare!」</p>
<p>「Urraa! Curry!」</p>
<p>「Fight! Calleee!」</p>
<p>To be honest, I don’t think we should put curry at the end of the conversation anymore, but I guess both Fran and the stepfathers were too used to it and were unaware of their strangeness.</p>
<p>She sometimes chased away magic beasts, sometimes helping each other with her friends, and sometimes with the help of the undead. All the warriors performed their duty without losing any of them.</p>
<p>They had run up a mountain of 3,000 meters in a short time and succeeded in crossing the ridge.</p>
<p>According to Raidos’ geographical information obtained from Avenger, the mountain range ran vertically and horizontally in the south, and it seemed to be quite a long way around if we avoided the mountains to the battlefield.</p>
<p>That’s why we decided to take the quickest route to the battlefield, over the mountains.</p>
<p>I knew in advance that he was quite reckless, but there were no complaints or confusion from the warriors. All he did was answer Fran’s order with 「Yes! Captain! Curry!」 as usual. I hadn’t been able to imagine what he would do a few days in advance.</p>
<p>We couldn’t see the battlefield from the ridge of the mountain. There was a mountainous area in front of it. All that was left was to descend, so we didn’t have to climb up the steep mountainous area for a long time. However, we had to keep descending the unstable rocky area.</p>
<p>Still, the valiant soldiers marched forward with Fran in the lead. There were about 50 undead following behind them.</p>
<p>They were not only the Genoside Ghouls, but also the Skeleton Dogs that they had created. The rest were the horses. It seemed that those other than humans were considered members of the troops if they willing to follow Fran’s lead.</p>
<p>The effect of the March of the Valkyrie was steadily spreading, and so were the effects on the undead and horses. Therefore, there were a good number of places where horses would normally not be able to go.</p>
<p>The group ran down the mountain in an almost straight line, using recovery magic to heal their legs. There was a hilly area in front of them, and it seemed that the fort of the Kingdom of Raidos was located at the end of it.</p>
<p>(The battle has already begun.)</p>
<p>『Yeah. I didn’t make it in time. But it’s not too late yet』</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
<p>The shouts of both armies echoed through the hills, indicating that the fierce battle had begun. With the presence of a battlefield, Fran turned to the warriors-in-law.</p>
<p>「Alignment.」</p>
<p>「「「「Yes! Captain! Curry!」」」」</p>
<p>「You guys are now no less than the useless goblins we had when we left. You’ve been able to perform your mission properly. A magnificent goblin」</p>
<p>『Not a goblin there, just an adventurer!』</p>
<p>「Nn. She’s a great adventurer now. So, I don’t have to put curry at the end of the conversation anymore, but I’m able to do my best」</p>
<p>「「「「Yes! Captain!」」」」</p>
<p>「I’m going to the battlefield now. But if we help each other with our friends, we can survive」</p>
<p>「「「「Yes! Captain!」」」」</p>
<p>「Let’s go then! I’ll save my comrades!」</p>
<p>「「「Yeah!」」」</p>
<p>And just like that, Fran led a group of warriors and undead on the battlefield.</p>
