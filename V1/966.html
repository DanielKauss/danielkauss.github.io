</div><h1>Chapter 966</h1><p>「Silard knights are staying at the inn beyond the plaza」</p>
<p>After exchanging information with Mea, Fran had safely reunited with Sophie and moved to see Addle with her.</p>
<p>Velmeria and Frederick had already left town to look for the Dragon King’s whereabouts.</p>
<p>We spoke to Sophie as she moved, but it seemed that she was no longer able to use her Divine Sword again.</p>
<p>「Can I appraise it?」</p>
<p>「Can you use appraisal on Fran? Okay, take a look at it」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>When I got permission to appraise her, I found that the Divine Sword Release part was■■■■■ Now that she mentioned it, Mea also said that she wanted me to see her.</p>
<p>I guess that means there’s nothing he can hide now.</p>
<p>Mea’s stats didn’t even say■■■■■ What’s the difference between them and the Divine Swordsman?</p>
<p>However, when I thought about it, there seemed to be a difference between being recognized by the Divine Sword or not.</p>
<p>In Sophie’s case, she may be capable of leading to the release of the Divine Sword, but she couldn’t really use the Divine Sword Release for various reasons. I guess that’s why she heard about it.</p>
<p>However, Sophie didn’t seem to be in a hurry. She was confident that she would be able to use it when needed.</p>
<p>In Mea’s case, she was probably not yet capable enough to use the Divine Sword Release itself.</p>
<p>「Mrgh. Addle.」</p>
<p>『That’s a good timing.』</p>
<p>As soon as the holy knights entered the inn, they were in front of it. It seems they were planning to leave somewhere else, since it was not like they were leaving the town.</p>
<p>The holy knights were nervous, probably because they noticed Fran and Urushi approaching them.</p>
<p>「Leave this to me」</p>
<p>「Are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Don’t worry, I’m just going to calm them down. They’re weirdly aggressive, maybe to protect Ader-dono.」</p>
<p>As she approached them with a smile, Mea shook her hand with a smile. Then the tension was lifted, as if the other side had also remembered Mea’s face.</p>
<p>But instead, she created an atmosphere that looked down on us.</p>
<p>「We’re going to Silard, the Holy Nation! Where are you going?」</p>
<p>「I can hear them without yelling. What are you talking about? Are you going to sell me the magic sword?」</p>
<p>Apparently, she didn’t know who Mea was. If she knew that she was a princess, she would be a little more concerned about the outside world and would not be able to sell her sword. It seemed that Lind was not a Divine Sword either.</p>
<p>「W-well, sure. We just came to the right place. Lead her to the saintess.」</p>
<p>「...Why?」</p>
<p>「That recovery ability is befitting of our country. We have decided to take her with us.」</p>
<p>What have I decided to take with me!? Fran was also quite frustrated inward. However, she didn’t seem to know that she was a Divine Swordsman, right? If she really had decided to take the Divine Swordsman by force, she would act more cautiously.</p>
<p>Perhaps the appraisers of the Holy Nation couldn’t see through Sophie’s abilities.</p>
<p>「I see. But since Saintess-sama had declared that she will remain in this city, the negotiations will be in vain, I think?」</p>
<p>「It’s not up to you to decide」</p>
<p>「Well, please negotiate later. I’ve brought a messenger from the Adventurers Guild.」</p>
<p>「Hmph. So, you mean they’re a messenger?」</p>
<p>The holy knight let out a grunt and looked at Fran and Urushi who were standing at a distance from her. I guess he didn’t like Mea’s attitude as she acted like she was equal to them.</p>
<p>However, her expression immediately turned into astonishment.</p>
<p>「Red lotus blade......!」</p>
<p>It seems the holy knights knew Isario’s face. Besides, they were not very close to him, which seemed to be a bit of a problem in Nocta.</p>
<p>「You’ve saved this city, haven’t you? You must do something unusual to you guys, right?」</p>
<p>「W-What are you saying!? We are the knights of the glorious Holy Nation! Protecting the weak is our mission!」</p>
<p>「Hmm? Well, that’s fine」</p>
<p>The holy knight’s expression of anger appeared on Isario’s face as he listened to his words uninterestedly. Isario was completely uninterested in her appearance, as he said he was uninterested in them or just wanted to dig a hole in his ear with his little finger.</p>
<p>The holy knight’s forehead had blue lines, so I could not even feel his killing intent. That’s why he couldn’t resort to force against this Divine Swordsman.</p>
<p>While the holy knights were still talking, Isario suddenly returned to his serious expression and gave them what he had to do in an austere voice.</p>
<p>「This is an urgent request from the administrative council. They are calling on other countries to provide forces to deal with the anomaly on this continent.」</p>
<p>「What is it?」</p>
<p>「Many countries have already decided to accept that request. And of course, the Adventurers Guild. I don’t think the Holy Nation will forget its duty, but what should we do?」</p>
<p>「What do you think we are!?」</p>
<p>「Oh! That’s a great chance!」</p>
<p>This was probably why Isario provoked him. She must have offended him so that he could talk more easily.</p>
<p>But then she waited that long. They were appraisers. Apparently, they were working in a different chain of command than the holy knights, and this unit seemed to have a say in this area.</p>
<p>「Wait! The Divine Sword Knight has been using the Divine Sword’s power on this continent three times. I won’t allow any further battles.」</p>
<p>The appraiser was right, and Ader didn’t seem to be at full power. It didn’t look like she was exhausted, but it felt like she was a little tired, wasn’t it? She looked like an accounting officer through the day.</p>
<p>I don’t think it was nearly impossible for her to fight. Isario also sighed lightly and said that he was nasty.</p>
<p>「Three times? Then you’ll be fine. I’m a Divine Swordsman too, and Alpha of the Holy Nation and Ignis of the Holy Nation were made by the same Divine level blacksmith. I know how spicy it is. If it’s only for three times, I should be able to go still. Aah, or maybe I won’t be able to fight anymore for just three times, even though my name was “Divine Sword Knight”? That’s that weak. I never thought that I would only be able to do something comparable to Rotort’s me」</p>
<p>「Kuh......!」</p>
<p>The appraiser could not say back to Isario’s words. After all, the Divine Swordsman was the most well known about the Divine Swordsman. I can’t say that Isario was lying.</p>
<p>And we couldn’t let Silard hear the last one. The Divine Sword Knight, who made their country a strong country, asked us 「Is he inferior to an adventurer?」</p>
<p>Of course, nodding to him would be off-limits, but if he denied it, he would affirm that Ader could still fight. Either way, the disadvantages were great.</p>
<p>They must have wanted to escape quickly from this continent, where the anomaly was occurring, without further pushing themselves against the continent.</p>
<p>「I heard that General Hagane accepted the request, right? Well, a big country! It’s a great decision, isn’t it?」</p>
<p>「Gnrgh......」</p>
<p>「So? What are you going to do? May I refuse. If you’re a coward and only think of yourself, and you want to prove that the Divine Sword Knights are inferior to adventurers, then?」</p>
<p>「Damn!」</p>
<p>In the end, they had no choice but to answer to their requests. If they could not do anything by force, they would not be able to refuse it from the beginning. If they refused, Silard would be blamed all over the world.</p>
<p>It was precisely because it was a large country that we had to protect its prestige. Well, I guess we could do something other than this much provocation, Isario, personally, that surpassed the country.</p>
<p>What was bothering me was that Ader did not give her the final decision. Although she was being treated as a higher-ups, Ader didn’t seem to have the right to decide.</p>
<p>The appraisers themselves didn’t complain, so they seemed to have the highest command over the horde.</p>
