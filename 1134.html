</div><h1>Chapter 1134</h1><p>「Ionez-sama!」</p>
<p>「You guys!」</p>
<p>After defeating Ionez, the vice-commander of the Crimson Flame Knights, the surrounding red knights launched killing intent at us.</p>
<p>However, the red knights who had lost their command were clearly disrupted in their coordination. And that was not what Fran and Urushi were talking about.</p>
<p>Fran and Urushi were still bewildered by Forrund’s release from the vice-commander Ionez. Then, my secret magic unleashed itself shattered the red knights aside.</p>
<p>And if the pressure of the red knights decreased, it would have a positive effect on other places.</p>
<p>The adventurers who had been on the offensive against the undead were even more free, and if the undead’s attention was distracted, the nobles could afford to regroup. The war situation then quickly leaned to the advantage of the Kranzel Kingdom.</p>
<p>But the Raidos Kingdom was not just watching.</p>
<p>After about 30 red knights were defeated, they decided that it would be impossible to rejoin the horde, and a thud rang out from the fort.</p>
<p>That seemed to be the signal of their retreat, as the red knights formed a line and began to descend to the fort. Normally they had a chance to go after us, but the fort and the knights fired flame magic at us.</p>
<p>The barrage of bullets made it impossible for the adventurers to follow behind them.</p>
<p>But now that it was no longer a disorderly brawl, it was easier for us to fight. We didn’t have to worry about involving our comrades anymore, and we could unleash our magic without any worries.</p>
<p>『Fran! Urushi! Let’s do this!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>『Ekato Keraunos!』</p>
<p>「Thunder Bolt!」</p>
<p>「Woooof!」</p>
<p>Fran, me, and Urushi’s dark magic rained down on the red knights as they retreated. However, the attacks did not defeat the soldiers. A barrier-like structure was deployed around the troops to block their magic.</p>
<p>But this was within our expectations.</p>
<p>In this world, where there are many strong men, a large unit is not necessarily the only advantage. The single magician who is more capable than expected by their opponent would be a disaster for them.</p>
<p>Therefore, it was inevitable that the equipment and techniques to prevent it had been researched in various countries. Even at sea, they were able to prevent magic from happening in the same way.</p>
<p>The Kingdom of Kranzel had similar equipment, and it was only natural that there were more powerful magic tools and circles on the battlefield of Raidos.</p>
<p>Wait, I guess we’ve heard more about it from Avenger. It was a fort that defended against important strongholds, so it had both physical and magic barriers.</p>
<p>However, it required quite a lot of magic power to use it at the same time, and the simultaneous deployment was limited to about 30 minutes. Currently, the battle was already prolonged, so there was probably only enough magic power to use the magic defense barrier for a short time.</p>
<p>We launch a series of magic attacks to get him to use the magic defense barrier. In the midst of all that, Forrund was ready.</p>
<p>『Can you get there now?』</p>
<p>(Yeah, I’ll leave it to you!)</p>
<p>Forrund nodded enthusiastically.</p>
<p>『Fran, Urushi, I’m going to do something flashy in the end!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「Woooof!」</p>
<p>In order to keep the magic defense barrier active, we released a spell that we didn’t know how many times already. And as we intended, the magic was blocked by the barrier.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Forrund stepped forward and held his right hand up to the sky.</p>
<p>In sync with his movements, Forrund’s magic swords, which the surrounding adventurers had possessed, disappeared as if melting into the void.</p>
<p>The strengthening from the magic sword would have disappeared, but now it was protecting the white magic power that Donadrond seemed to be using. Even without the Forrund sword, he would not be easily inferior.</p>
<p>I could see that a huge amount of magic power was returned to Forrund. Apparently, magic power was used to materialize and maintain it, and when I released it, I could recover the magic power that made up the sword.</p>
<p>「O mercenaries of flesh and blood, slash at me. Ten Thousand Swords.」</p>
<p>Her voice was still low, Forrund, but I could clearly hear her muttering. I guess the power contained in her words gave her an air of presence.</p>
<p>The next moment, countless swords gushed out of the void and swung down toward the earth, as if they had been wielded by an invisible arm.</p>
<p>Moreover, they did not attack just randomly. All of the more than a hundred slashes were aimed at us.</p>
<p>Many of the slashes had knocked the red knights down like guild blades. Even the dodged attacks were mostly severed to the knights.</p>
<p>Moreover, each of them was a magic sword with special powers. It even had additional effects, such as burning wounds, turning them into poison, and paralyzing them with lightning.</p>
<p>What a terrifying attack. Even against an army or a one-on-one battle, it was just as powerful as hell.</p>
<p>『Alright! Now we can deal with the undead without worrying about our backs!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「Yeah」</p>
<p>They probably still had troops in the fort, but if the strongest army, the Red Knight, was destroyed, they would be able to deploy instantly.</p>
<p>『Forrund, hang in there a little more.』</p>
<p>(I’ll be fine.)</p>
<p>In fact, Forrund had already used up most of his magic power. After all, such attacks and backlash must have been great.</p>
<p>However, if he falls to the ground visible from the fort, it would mean that Forrund’s attacks would no longer be possible. That would not be a deterrent.</p>
<p>So, the plan was to have them work a little harder and ride on Urushi to evacuate from the battlefield.</p>
<p>(I’ll enjoy it.)</p>
<p>『Yeah, I’m on it!』</p>
