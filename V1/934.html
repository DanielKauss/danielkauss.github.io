</div><h1>Chapter 934</h1><p>「Auntie......」</p>
<p>Fran went to Mulsani’s mansion and was immediately invited in just by mentioning her name. Apparently, Fran’s identity was passed on to the merchants’ association.</p>
<p>Mulsani wasn’t doing his job, but the maid ushered him to Nadia’s room.</p>
<p>It was small and not too luxurious. But the room was very well-cleaned and well-kept.</p>
<p>She must have thought about Nadia’s hobbies and decided on the best room for us.</p>
<p>「He won’t wake up」</p>
<p>『I appraised it, and there’s nothing wrong with it......』</p>
<p>Even after I used healing or life magic, Nadia’s condition did not change. The same went for Fran and Urushi after the defense of Sendia. No, Nadia’s inside was probably more tattered and badly worn out.</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>Fran sat on a chair beside the bed, staring silently at Nadia’s face. For a moment, gentle time passed, but Fran stood up quickly with a look of determination.</p>
<p>「Master, let’s go to the guild」</p>
<p>『Are you all right?』</p>
<p>「Nn. If I don’t work, I’ll be offended by Auntie.」</p>
<p>『Is that so?』</p>
<p>Fran patted Nadia’s face lightly at the end and turned her back to the bed.</p>
<p>「Auntie, welcome back」</p>
<p>I could see that Fran was quietly energized. If the Dragon King’s dark moves continued, this Nocta could be in danger.</p>
<p>We must do our part to protect Nadia, defeat the Dragon King and the slavers, and bring peace back to this continent.</p>
<p>I guess she was determined that way.</p>
<p>After leaving the mansion, Fran hurried to the guild without buying anything.</p>
<p>But I didn’t need to just give him the letter. Naturally, Fran, who was active in Sendia directly, asked her to talk to him.</p>
<p>Fran then gave him a rough account of the situation in her own words. Well, she mainly talked about the Dragon King’s actions.</p>
<p>「Thanks for the information. We’ll look into the Dragon King too.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Please」</p>
<p>「But still, I didn’t know that Sendia was so cornered...... The accurate information is helpful. To be honest, the information is so mixed, that we don’t know what’s right」</p>
<p>Since it had been quite a while since the end of the battle, various information had been brought to Nocta as well. However, there was clearly some conflicting information, so it was not sure which of them was true.</p>
<p>A Divine Swordsman Appeared. A Divine Dragon Form Dragonmen Appeared. They were attacked and destroyed by one million antidemons. The saintess died. No, it was the Sendia family’s ruler who died. The beastmen did their best. The dragonkin also seemed to have done their best.</p>
<p>There was too much information, from silly to truth-telling. Moreover, the information this time was more dangerous because it was more true than ridiculous.</p>
<p>However, with this much information mixed in, there might have been less information about Fran and Katley than I had worried.</p>
<p>Especially in the case of Fran and Mea, we couldn’t tell what kind of state they were on the outside. At least, it seemed that there wouldn’t be any information on the Divine Beast or the White Beast available.</p>
<p>We blurted out about the Divine Sword and the Divine Beast Transformation and reported the Dragon King’s wrongdoings.</p>
<p>They wouldn’t believe everything out of the blue, but the Adventurers Guild was on our side. There’s no doubt the dragonkin killed the guildmaster of Sendia.</p>
<p>The situation was clearly hostile.</p>
<p>Well, I won’t let him do it though.</p>
<p>「......You want the meat to be wholesal?」</p>
<p>「Are you sure?」</p>
<p>「Thanks for that!」</p>
<p>I knew it, their meat was half-eaten. It’s not like they were a bribe, but let’s offer them the meat at a reasonable price.</p>
<p>And if there was meat, then of course there would be a party. That was what adventurers were all about.</p>
<p>Well, this time, it was a request from the guildmasters. They wanted to get out of the way before the adventurers, who had continued the series of battles, were dissatisfied.</p>
<p>They were going to send out to support the neighboring cities tomorrow, so we had to refrain from drinking. But we were serving a little bit of it though.</p>
<p>「「「「Wahahahaha!」」」」</p>
<p>「「「「For a meat girl!」」」</p>
<p>「「「Cheers!」」」</p>
<p>But we forgot that the number of adventurers was increasing. Also, there were a lot of people who failed to attend the last party after all.</p>
<p>She must have asked her friends and acquaintances to let her know when a party was about to be held. With the addition of demonkin and dwarven adventurers, the number of people in the party had more than doubled compared to last time.</p>
<p>Because of this, it took a long time to dismantle the necessary amount. Meanwhile, more adventurers must have gathered.</p>
<p>The guildmaster had asked us to serve a lot of meat, so we were not going to hold back!</p>
<p>We used the entire building of the guild to have a drunk and sung brawl.</p>
<p>「「「「We are adventurers~...♪」」」」</p>
<p>「「「The golden adventurers~...♪」」」</p>
<p>When that song started singing, Fran joined in. It was a song I’ve been listening to all along in the fight, and now it’s Fran’s favorite song. The lyrics were perfect.</p>
<p>We were grilling the meat and singing together. Aah, even though it was grilled, Fran and Urushi were the ones who were eating the most. In fact, they were doing it by grilling their meat to the adventurers with one hand.</p>
<p>As we were holding a large party, we saw a man come into the underground training hall.</p>
<p>There was a reason why we noticed him among all the adventurers.</p>
<p>(Master, that sword......)</p>
<p>(Woof.)</p>
<p>『Yeah, it’s definitely a Divine Sword』</p>
<p>Gaia, Lindwurm, and Oratorio. After we had seen several Divine Swords, we had come to understand the presence of Divine Swords.</p>
<p>Well, it’s kinda like a half-intuition, but I’m sure it was this time. After all, the three of them feel the same way.</p>
<p>The long sword that the shaggy gray-haired man at his waist was definitely a divine sword.</p>
<p>And she walked leisurely toward us.</p>
<p>(...She’s strong?)</p>
<p>『I don’t know. I don’t know, but...... There’s no way the wielder of the divine sword is weak.』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p>We stared at the man, but I couldn’t quite understand his strength. He looked strong and weak. In other words, he was so superior that even we could not see through his abilities.</p>
<p>The word “monster” comes to my mind.</p>
<p>A monster like that was right in front of us.</p>
