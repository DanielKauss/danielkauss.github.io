</div><h1>Chapter 1002</h1><p>『The one I thought was the mastermind died out so easily......』</p>
<p>(Master, everyone.)</p>
<p>Frederick and the others changed after Georg was defeated.</p>
<p>He stopped moving and began to suffer. He was moaning with his head in his arms. Then, there was a hint of reason on his face.</p>
<p>Velmeria and Frederick were conscious, but Tilanaria collapsed.</p>
<p>「F-Fran......」</p>
<p>「Velmeria!」</p>
<p>It seems that Georg was the one who caused them to go crazy. But why was Georg in a similar state?</p>
<p>「Heal!」</p>
<p>「No! Okay!」</p>
<p>「Velmeria?」</p>
<p>「We don’t know what will happen yet. Just leave it like this for now」</p>
<p>Velmeria still thought that it might be possible for her to control it. That was why she thought it was better if she could not move properly.</p>
<p>Apparently, he still remembered the time when he was on a rampage. Frederick, who was lying on the ground, also looked apologetic.</p>
<p>「I’m sorry, Black Lightning Princess.」</p>
<p>「Don’t worry. More importantly, are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Yeah...」</p>
<p>It seems that the backlash and exhaustion from unleashing her best was worse than the damage. She wouldn’t die without healing.</p>
<p>Should we evacuate Velmeria and Frederick before we can do something about the robe bastard? Fran must have thought the same thing.</p>
<p>「Isario, evacuate Velmeria and Frederick――」</p>
<p>「You think I’ll let you?」</p>
<p>What interrupted Fran’s voice was a lovely girl’s voice. This was a clear voice, just perfect for rolling a bell.</p>
<p>But the one who was surprised was the one who said that.</p>
<p>「Oi oi. It’s been a while, but you’re finally awake? Robe bastard」</p>
<p>「I’m not a bastard」</p>
<p>「Girl?」</p>
<p>「I’m not the year I’d be called a girl though」</p>
<p>Under her robe came a beautiful young girl with beautiful blond wavy hair and white skin. She was short and did not seem to be over twenty years old.</p>
<p>She has a very good ear, so maybe she’s an elf? My appraisal is still repelled as usual...... She must have a very high level of concealment abilities.</p>
<p>As I was struggling to figure out how to appraise her, the girl suddenly started laughing.</p>
<p>「Ahahahaha! You really don’t like it! I’ve been preparing it for a long time, and I’ve finally made it into action! I never thought I’d be interfered with so easily! Aah, it was strange!」</p>
<p>And despite her words, she didn’t smile. She was staring at us angrily.</p>
<p>「What the true Dragon King! I even gave him the Divine Dragon Form skill, but he lost so easily! That was really useless! Even so, I was expecting that was ridiculous! In the end, I was just a piece of shit dragonkin that was not worth living!」</p>
<p>There was no trace of affectionate expression in the girl’s face as she shouted. What I could feel from her bottomless deep dark eyes was hatred and madness.</p>
<p>It was strange because just by looking at the little girl with such eyes, her power doubled. Isario seemed to be wary and slowly spoke to the girl.</p>
<p>「Who are you?」</p>
<p>「Why don’t you hit it?」</p>
<p>「Are they an elf?」</p>
<p>The girl replied with a laughing expression on her face. It was a strong expression. However, Isario didn’t get angry and opened his mouth with a grin.</p>
<p>She decided to deal with the girl. She must be trying to get information from her. Fran also stopped her movements once so as not to provoke her opponent.</p>
<p>「I heard the dragonkin have a grudge against you.」</p>
<p>「Ara? You know that, don’t you?」</p>
<p>「So you’re saying she’s not an elf?」</p>
<p>「By the way, I think you’re older than me, right?」</p>
<p>By all accounts, he looked to be only the same age as Fran, but it wouldn’t be strange if he was a long-living race. Was he a long-living race other than an elf and very similar to an elf? What kind of race was he?</p>
<p>「Huh? So what in the world is that onee-sama hiding somewhere? Did she not work with the Dragon King, who should have been holding a grudge against her?」</p>
<p>「Partner? Does it look like that?」</p>
<p>「Well, it looks like the hierarchical relationship is strong, doesn’t it?」</p>
<p>「Fufu, you’re right, I’m good at training lizards」</p>
<p>Velmeria reacted to the gloomy smile on the girl’s face.</p>
<p>「What are you――」</p>
<p>「I don’t allow lizards to talk about it on their own. Shut up. The air here is dirty.」</p>
<p>There was no smile on the girl’s face as she replied. Just by looking at her face, I could tell that she really hated dragonkin. There was no such thing as a friendly look on Velmeria and Frederick’s face.</p>
<p>「Yeah, I’m scared. What the hell just happened? You hate dragonkin that much, don’t you?」</p>
<p>「Hmm. That’s not interesting. It’s just my kin’s revenge.」</p>
<p>「Haha, I see」</p>
<p>So, you’re saying your goal is to take revenge? It’s certainly not interesting, but it’s also troublesome. If a source of action is resentment, it’s difficult to make them give up.</p>
<p>「Should I leave those dragonkin behind? Shouldn’t we just let them go?」</p>
<p>「You’re pretty confident, aren’t you? The uncle is an S-ranked adventurer, you know? He’s quite strong, you know?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, I don’t think I can beat him, right?」</p>
<p>After saying that, the girl remained confident.</p>
<p>The girl gripped the hilt of a strange sword stuck in its core and turned her other palm to us. Immediately after, a dense evil spirit swelled out of the girl’s body and attacked us.</p>
<p>『Get close!』</p>
<p>The evil energy, which had stretched out like a tentacle, dissipated into thin air with my skill. I guess the Evil Spirit Control worked.</p>
<p>The girl looked surprised for the first time when she saw that.</p>
<p>「Impossible! The power to control Evil Spirits is other......?」</p>
