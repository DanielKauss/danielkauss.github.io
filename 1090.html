</div><h1>Chapter 1090</h1><p>「Th-that’s terrible!」</p>
<p>One of the soldiers under our command jumped into the office without a knock. His complexion was pale, showing that something serious had happened.</p>
<p>Maybe he’ll scold them later?</p>
<p>「What happened? Did the magicians annihilate him this time?」</p>
<p>The other day, there was a huge incident in the research tower of our castle, in which all the alchemists under our command died at once.</p>
<p>According to the Director of the Magician who conducted the investigation, she had been cursed by an inverted curse.</p>
<p>Cursing was a vicious power that could affect a wide area depending on how you use it. However, this was also a double-edged sword. When a curse is returned or the technique is erased, the curse is returned to the caster.</p>
<p>The reason for the annihilation of the alchemists was the curse that had been returned.</p>
<p>Apparently, the magic stone weapon used for wide-area contamination that we had brought to the Kingdom of Kranzel was destroyed. Normally, the curse would go out of control and pollute the surrounding area, but some of it had been returned to the casters.</p>
<p>I didn’t think it would be easy to return the curse that the alchemists had put together, but there was actually a damage caused by it. It was either a very powerful magician dispelled the curse, or she destroyed the entire magic expression with the stone.</p>
<p>It hurt me the death of Ansel, the previous head of the alchemist. He shouldn’t have been involved in the area-contaminated curse, but for some reason, he had lost his life.</p>
<p>How much did she think she had invested in that lunatic? How easily died? Even though that guy was the only one who could replicate the magic sword capable of killing demons! Thanks to her, we had no choice but to rethink our strategy against Philias.</p>
<p>It was really a headache. That’s why I made a joke about how the magician had been annihilated...</p>
<p>「Did you know him?」</p>
<p>「What? What do you mean?」</p>
<p>「Umm, all the magicians are gone!」</p>
<p>「I-Impossible!」</p>
<p>We heard screams from the magician’s research tower many times, and when we stepped inside, we found that all the people inside had died and had fallen.</p>
<p>We hurriedly rushed to the tower, and found many guards and magicians already at the entrance. Call out to the magician chief who was with us.</p>
<p>「What happened?」</p>
<p>「Rivers-sama! I’m currently investigating the possibility, but the magicians under my command are all gone. There’s a possibility that it was caused by poison, so I can’t get any closer to you」</p>
<p>「W-What’s that poison?」</p>
<p>「Haa! No magicians were injured, and there was no sign of them being attacked」</p>
<p>「...Okay」</p>
<p>Of course, poison research had been conducted in the tower. If that really was the cause, wouldn’t this place be in danger? No, was it a problem for the soldiers to be safe?</p>
<p>「The investigation is not going well because there are classified documents inside...」</p>
<p>「We’ll allow the guards to enter. We need to hurry to find out what’s going on. With an eye on assassination in mind――」</p>
<p>「Hey, Duke-sama! This is a disaster!」</p>
<p>「This time!」</p>
<p>「T-This way......」</p>
<p>The messenger would take me to a less popular place. Was there an emergency that no one else could hear about?</p>
<p>「What happened?」</p>
<p>「In addition to the three water dragonkin, all the ships we sent have been sunk......!」</p>
<p>「Don’t be stupid! There are only three water dragonkin, you know? And I’m sure the demonkin were on board too!」</p>
<p>「I-I see, but it is a fact that our communications have been severed...」</p>
<p>What was going on? Did the fleet really sink? It was a water dragonkin that we had nowhere else to go, right? Did the Kranzel navy say it was that strong?</p>
<p>As I was wondering what to do, I saw the magician chief, who had been conducting an on-site inspection, running toward us. He must have understood something.</p>
<p>「Hey, Duke. The cause of his death has been discovered. Apparently, he was captured by the curse he returned.」</p>
<p>「Cursed? More!」</p>
<p>「At Ansel-dono’s urging, my men had been sent out to curse him. I believe it was a curse from a magic stone soldier we deployed in the Kingdom of Shallus」</p>
<p>「That curse has been returned?」</p>
<p>「Yes. That’s, in other words...」</p>
<p>「So there’s something wrong with the army that was supposed to attack from the Kingdom of Shallus?」</p>
<p>I don’t get what they’re talking about. Did the Kranzel Kingdom deploy countermeasures against the curse all over their forces? We need to investigate this.</p>
<p>「Let’s get in touch with Derick. I’ll have him gather more information about Kranzel as soon as possible」</p>
<p>「...That’s right」</p>
<p>The Chief Magician blurted out my words.</p>
<p>「What’s wrong?」</p>
<p>「Derick-dono’s regular contact has been canceled. Also, I believe the reason why Ansel-dono lost his life was because of the curse of killing demons returned......」</p>
<p>「So you’re saying that more than half of all alchemists and magicians were cursed, annihilating the fleet, including the water dragonkin. Also, the ground forces he sent to Shallus have been completely destroyed, making it impossible for delicates to contact you?」</p>
<p>「...Y-you’re right」</p>
<p>「Don’t be stupid! I just think how much time and money you’ve spent to get the situation over!」</p>
<p>They had been preparing for more than a decade to definitely defeat the Kingdom of Kranzel and defeat Filias afterwards!</p>
<p>I thought they had finally started the plan, but everything failed in a few days? How much of the Kranzel Kingdom had left behind for the defense of the country!</p>
<p>I’m in a position to get a lot of information about other countries. I don’t take adventurers lightly like those idiots. But I never thought I was this strong!</p>
<p>Since the plan to destroy the Kingdom of Kranzel with Marquis Ashtner was halfway through, she should have been maximising her attention to Kranzel, but...</p>
<p>Was the information leaking from somewhere? We must take that possibility into account.</p>
<p>「You can use any stealth unit. Get an idea of what’s going on in Kranzel. Even if he’s already captured, he won’t be able to tell any information. He should still be able to use his stronghold or skills.」</p>
<p>「U-Understood!」</p>
<p>「I have heard the rumors, but to think the magical sword capable of devouring antidemons actually existed.」</p>
<p>「Shit! Shit!」</p>
<p>Always be calm. That’s what their ancestors said when they took over the throne, but I can’t be too calm. On the contrary, I heard meaningless curses coming from her mouth.</p>
<p>I know. I know that it has become a ship that has been hit and sinking to a level that cannot be described with words such as hardship.</p>
<p>He bit the claws of his thumb so hard that it shattered. The habit of being corrected as a child would come out involuntarily. I guess he was that upset. It was just a dumb thing. What he was doing looked strangely objective.</p>
<p>「I’ll be more strict on you then」</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>I saw something nasty about it from someone I didn’t like. Thanks to that, I was able to regain a little of my composure.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, what was standing behind us was a faceless, small man with a black robe deep in his eyes. This man was Hydman, one of the undead with reason, under the control of the Southern Duke.</p>
<p>「...Hydman, huh? He’s still showing up everywhere, as usual.」</p>
<p>「That’s me. Besides, you’re allowed to enter the place, right?」</p>
<p>「What did you want?」</p>
<p>「I was hoping I could help you in some way, but what do you think? Let’s find Derick-dono and make a connection with her?」</p>
<p>「......Save me, what’s in it for the Southern Duke――No, the Black Skeleton Corps?」</p>
<p>「What the hell is it, those who serve the same country, we have to help each other when we get into trouble?」</p>
<p>What the hell is that? The rotting undead! Wasn’t the timing going too good in the first place?</p>
<p>That’s right, as if she knew that we would need their help. Could it be that she knew what was going on Kranzel’s side......?</p>
<p>「Oya? Even if you stare at me, things won’t get any better, right?」</p>
<p>「I know!」</p>
<p>They’re way too suspicious, but no proof. Besides, since she was a high-ranking member of the Black Skeleton Army, there was no doubt that this undead speaking guy, Hydeman, would be useful.</p>
<p>「Hmm. Now that delicates is back, my territory is already...」</p>
<p>「Gufufufu. I have a suggestion for that」</p>
<p>「...What is it?」</p>
<p>「I would like you to lend me the western treasure...」</p>
<p>This guy! I’ve been that way from the beginning! Like I thought, the Southern Duke is......!</p>
<p>「Don’t be ridiculous! This is the family treasure that the first generation has given me to prove my title! There is no way I can leave it to another family!」</p>
<p>「However, the treasures from the south and the treasure from the west were originally intended to be used in pairs. If we had assembled them, it would have been possible to throw a stone at the current war situation. Now, it is still possible to prevent a complete failure, right? My Lord will be grateful for that」</p>
<p>Certainly, my actions could collapse the invasion. If that continued, the Southern and Eastern Dukes would surely pursue my responsibility.</p>
<p>However, the treasure was the hidden treasure of the Duke. No, but――</p>
<p>「......Okay. I’ll take that condition. In exchange, find out where Dirk is as soon as possible. I’ll lend you the treasured item depending on the information.」</p>
<p>「Guh! I have just received a request from Hydeman, the sixth seat of the Black Skeleton Corps!」</p>
