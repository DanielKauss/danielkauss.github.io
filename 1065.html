</div><h1>Chapter 1065</h1><p>After escaping the town with the liberated Dahz people, we continued to walk toward the south-east. After a few days of walking in the inland, we found a town of some size.</p>
<p>First, let’s check the status of the situation.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, we reunited with the adventurers we had escaped earlier. Thanks to this, we had more guards, making it easier for us to move around, and Fran was in a good mood.</p>
<p>He didn’t seem to have time to chase us on Raydoss’s side, and did not show up. In fact, the magic beast was more troublesome for us.</p>
<p>According to the information we got from the commander and the magic beastmen, there had been a small number of scouting and operation troops leaving Dahz since the capture, but that was enough to reach a total of 30.</p>
<p>That matches the information we got from Valuza.</p>
<p>I’m a little worried about the information that they are planning to take over some village, but we can get information about that when we get to the evacuation destination.</p>
<p>Four days after we escaped from Dars.</p>
<p>We managed to reach the town without leaving any casualties. It was lockers, a lodging town second only to Dards in this area.</p>
<p>The group that had arrived was greeted by 60 per cent welcome, 30 per cent subtle faces, and 10 per cent troubled. The welcome was the refugees from Dahz, who had lived in tents outside the town. They were happy that their friends were still alive.</p>
<p>Those subtle faces were probably that of the security guards and some of the residents of this town. They couldn’t be proud of the increase in the number of people left to cause a scene.</p>
<p>The people who looked in trouble were the residents of this town. They must be worried about the shortage of food. There had suddenly been an increase of 300 people during the war. So, it was no wonder they felt a gloomy feeling about the distribution of food.</p>
<p>Let’s put up a show here.</p>
<p>After we had finished talking to the guards, I decided to let Fran say a few words to them a little loudly.</p>
<p>First, we will pile up a few cargo we have taken from the Raidos Kingdom and show that this was our strength.</p>
<p>「This is the food we took from Raidos. It contains a lot of bean and other ingredients」</p>
<p>「Ooh! C-could you offer it to me? Please, I definitely want you to sell it!」</p>
<p>This Chief Soldier was a very nice person, wasn’t he? Rather than asking him to let us go, he asked me to sell it. I’m sure he could have forced us to extort him since we were in war.</p>
<p>「Then, what do you mean? Is that what you really think?」</p>
<p>Fran opened her mouth, piling up a few more crates.</p>
<p>「I’m the one who took it from Raidos, so I don’t need the money.」</p>
<p>「Re-really?」</p>
<p>「I don’t have any money. Rather than that, I want you to accept anyone I brought with me」</p>
<p>「Th-that’s of course possible」</p>
<p>「Some of them were soldiers of Dards, so they could help us protect this town」</p>
<p>「Oh! That’s a great help!」</p>
<p>Perhaps noticing our intentions on the way there, the commander answered us too loudly.</p>
<p>Well, my line of thinking was simple: I could provide them with food and troops! I was just loudly advertising that they would come in handy, so I shouldn’t make it too hard!</p>
<p>I could see the expressions on the faces of the residents of the lockers who had heard this softened considerably. After all, a large amount of food was piled up in front of them.</p>
<p>But the current rockers, which have thousands of people gathered together, can only cover for a day, even if it looks a lot. What kind of magic is it?</p>
<p>Well, we could add more when we ran out of them though.</p>
<p>「Where should we ship this?」</p>
<p>「We’ll do it now」</p>
<p>「But it’ll be easier if I do it」</p>
<p>「Yeah, but I wanted to show the residents that this much supplies have been brought in, and also to prevent those who have nothing left to do from working. We’ll just do what we have to do」</p>
<p>「Done what?」</p>
<p>「We’re in trouble, getting drunk from fights and stealing, and we’re in a lot of trouble. The security in the town was just terrible right now. The sailors of Dahz were especially rough, and they were not a good match for the thugs that were originally in our town」</p>
<p>Aah, I’m sure there are already various conflicts between the refugees and the residents. Especially among the ruffians, there seems to be a contest between their territory.</p>
<p>They wanted to tire the idiots who had a lot of strength with their heavy lifting by carrying them around in the town to show people a large amount of supplies and give them a sense of security.</p>
<p>「You want to be honest?」</p>
<p>「If you don’t listen to me, I won’t let you go. You’ve brought in a lot of forces with you, and I’ll count you as one of my forces when the time comes.」</p>
<p>So, they wanted to empower the thugs, who were more used to fighting than the average person, to use them as a force. Like I thought, he was a capable man.</p>
<p>We said goodbye to the smiling Chief Soldier and headed for the Adventurers Guild. We were going to report on what happened in Dards. With this, the request in Barbra would be complete.</p>
<p>When we entered the guild, we already saw Charlotte and the others. It seemed that they had reported on this incident. Even after hearing from the side, there was not much information we had heard along the way from Dahz.</p>
<p>However, there was one new story to be told. Charlotte had been told that she would be taken to a village called Metelm throughout the day.</p>
<p>Then the guildmaster, who had been listening to the report, raised his voice in surprise.</p>
<p>「What do you mean by “metery”? Is that true?」</p>
<p>「Y-yes. A prominent person said so」</p>
<p>「Right now, there are many refugees coming to lockers from the surrounding towns and villages. However, there is not a single refugees coming from Metelmum」</p>
<p>I thought they just didn’t get any information from us, but it seemed they were sending out adventurers. However, they would not come back.</p>
<p>「I’d be fine as long as the adventurers had an accident along the way and hadn’t received any information from us. But if that was not the case......」</p>
<p>「Metelmum also has Raydoss forces?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. That’s a possibility.」</p>
<p>The guildmaster’s eyes turned to Fran as he muttered this.</p>
<p>「There’s Fran-dono, the Black Lightning Princess, right?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「I want to make a request to you for scouting and rescueing Metermam. What do you think?」</p>
