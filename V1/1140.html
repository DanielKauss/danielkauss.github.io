</div><h1>Chapter 1140</h1><p>A human-shaped demon appeared out of the blood magic circle created by Mareficent, covered in jet-black.</p>
<p>His limbs were so thin that it seemed like he was too skinny, but the eyes of those black-eyed white eyes, where white and black were reversed from human, had a strange aura. His plump egg-shaped face had a belligerent smile on his face.</p>
<p>However, strangely enough, I didn’t sense a warrior’s presence. The way he stood didn’t seem to indicate that he had any high level martial arts skills. Was he a pure magician?</p>
<p>It would be doubtful if this demon could single-handedly support the battlefield.</p>
<p>Rank B adventurers? That’s what I was thinking, but the true nature of this demon was not its fighting ability.</p>
<p>「Wooo~f!」</p>
<p>The demon thrust its hands forward and roared, stopping several of Dullahan’s opponents from moving. Shortly after, the headless knight in red armor collapsed on the spot like a doll with broken strings.</p>
<p>「My strength in fighting is about average, but I’m specialized in fighting against necromancy. If I work with Forrund-dono, I might be able to hold back 1,000 or 2000 undead」</p>
<p>Even so, I still felt a little uneasy about her purely military strength, but I guess we have no choice but to trust her now. Flame magic was still flying from the fort, causing damage.</p>
<p>I also thought it would be better to force the Dullahan army to escape for a moment, but I was sure that if we defeated their top brass here, we would be able to inflict a painful blow on the Kingdom of Raidos.</p>
<p>And there were a lot of other adventurers out there too. I, as well as Fran, wanted to mourn for them. Well, Fran was much more motivated than me though.</p>
<p>(Master! Let’s go!)</p>
<p>『Yeah, you’re right』</p>
<p>「Maleficent. Who is this persona?」</p>
<p>「Of course, I’ll take you with me」</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>Persona was also shaking her head in a state where she was being held by Marefiscent like a baby. I was not sure if she was fine in such a state, but I guess she would be fine as long as Marefiscent judged that there was no problem.</p>
<p>「Okay, ride on Urushi’s back!」</p>
<p>「Ooh! Thank you very much!」</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>The persona on her back first was clinging to Urushi’s back and sniffing his fur. His mouth loosened, and he was clearly looking forward to it. This guy looked pretty energetic.</p>
<p>「Wait a minute, priestess! Bring me with you!」</p>
<p>「...Okay, we’ll be right behind Mareficent」</p>
<p>「Yes!」</p>
<p>「Eh? Please don’t poison it?」</p>
<p>「Of course. Well, it won’t even smell like that, so you have to give up on that」</p>
<p>Avenger seemed like something other than Fran to be important. Besides, since it was a ghoul, it could get a little annoying in some aspects.</p>
<p>However, if we wanted to take him with us, we would have no choice but to ride on it. Let’s have Mareficent hold back here.</p>
<p>「Uu~. Persona, please purify your entire body later」</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>「Forrund, Donad, please take care of this.」</p>
<p>「Yeah」</p>
<p>「I’ll be counting on you over there! But don’t push yourself too hard, okay? Surviving is the most important job of any adventurer!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Race: Ragnarok Wolf; Demon Wolf; Magic Beast</p>
<p>If that was the case, I wanted to take it head-on.</p>
<p>And sure enough, the tip of that flame magic was pointed at us.</p>
<p>I was born several decades ago, it seems. Not that it means much to me considering how I don’t remember living that long myself.</p>
<p>This should considerably reduce the burden on Forrund and the others.</p>
<p>『Urushi, take care of it!』</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>「Urushi, do your best!」</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>With the support of the girls, Urushi was able to accelerate even further. While running around in the air, he dodged the flame magic spectacularly.</p>
<p>The barrage of bullets getting more and more violent. Did they start getting stuffy too? But as long as Urushi’s evasion ability and the barrier between me and Mareficent, we should be fine.</p>
<p>Amid the countless explosions that covered the air, Urushi made a quick move.</p>
<p>(Master, can we get here now?)</p>
<p>『There’s no ward left...... I guess.』</p>
<p>We fired an attack at the fort, but it didn’t seem to be protected by any barriers. It seemed that the fort’s defense mechanism was not functioning better than I had imagined.</p>
<p>『If that’s the case, let’s just go up on the rooftop where the Knights of the Crimson Flame is!』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>As Urushi descended onto the rooftop, dodging further intensifying attacks, the young man was staring at us with grit. After seeing it up close, he looked really similar to Ionez, the vice-commander.</p>
<p>Appraisal was working fine. The main mission of the Red Knight Order was to fight magic beasts, and they were not planning to fight outside. That was probably why they were not prepared to be appraised.</p>
<p>It was simply, quite strong. It had more than a thousand magic power, had a level of Fire Magic of 9, and several useful skills for magicians such as Split Thinking without chanting. And yet, it had a high level of Sword Mastery of 7, too.</p>
<p>Even in her base abilities, she was on the level of a Rank A adventurer.</p>
<p>But the most conspicuous feature of this man was his equipment. A strange metal tool in his hand was radiating vicious magic power.</p>
<p>It was a tube about two meters long with a handle, shot iron, and a trigger. It looked like a gun. No, more like a gun, or rather, more futile? It looked like a laser gun, used by a bipedal walker to release a beam in a science fiction work.</p>
<p>I don’t think the name was a very fantasy work either. The appraisal said that it was a “Flaming-Style-Controlled Armed Cama Inflation Im”.</p>
<p>It had the ability to: Shell, Flame Control, Flame Amplification, Flame Absorption, Effect-sharing, and■■■ itself was a powerful cannon, allowing flame control to be shared under its control.</p>
<p>What’s more,■■■ is disturbing too. The Divine Sword Release was hidden when I checked Sophie’s stats a while ago.</p>
<p>No way, this was not a Divine Sword, was it? Perhaps this was a piece of treasure.</p>
<p>But before we could question the man, his muzzle shone a reddish light.</p>
<p>「He’s dead!」</p>
