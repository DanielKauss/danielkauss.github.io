</div><h1>Chapter 1072</h1><p>Ronowe borrowed Satia’s body to reveal himself. The magic power radiating from his body was overwhelming. He was probably much stronger than the demons we fought in Alessa’s goblin dungeon before. It seems that the manifestation is the state in which one can draw out the most of the demon’s original power. Even so, if you don’t use it easily, it probably requires a lot of power... </p>
<p>「Let’s erase this entire village! Become my sacrifice and disappear!」</p>
<p> Even if it’s a weakness in short-term battles, it doesn’t matter if it’s fuel consumption or exhaustion! In a short-term battle, even if it was just a weakpoint in terms of fuel consumption and exhaustion, it wouldn’t do much to it!  The Devil Ronowe shouted and turned his whole body into hundreds of tentacles. When he thought that his body exploded, he became countless tentacles and attacked the villagers.  If things continued like this, men and women, mother and child would be annihilated.  It would be impossible to block everything! Just like I thought, Fran must have sensed the danger.  She hesitated for a moment. However, she immediately turned her confusion and stepped forward.  Fran and Satia were friends, and the people in this village were only friends we had never met today. If they were to prioritize getting along with their friends, they might abandon them and let Fran and Satria go.  They might have their reasons for doing so. If they were to antagonize Fran here, they would not only lose their friends, but they could also make enemies with the Kingdom of Philias. Even so, Fran chose to help the villagers.  </p>
<p>「Haaaaaah!」</p>
<p>  Turning into black lightning, Fran walked forward through the gap between the tentacles. The writhing black lump at the base of the tentacles approached us.  Right now, Fran was probably in a state similar to when she slashed against Trismegistus on the continent of Gordisia. Perhaps she unconsciously used the blessings of the Beast and Insect God, Fran herself had unleashed Divine Attributes.  Out of it, she unleashed a slash at a godspeed, similar to Heavenly Judgment.  It was not flashy. However, my blade had definitely sliced through the amorphed Ronowe.  A black lump then snapped into two letters.  At the same time, I could see that its mind and magic power were also taking damage. I was confident that I had sliced through an invisible part.  </p>
<p>「Kiiaaaaah!」</p>
<p>  Ronowe let out a high-pitched scream like an echo. At the same time, countless tentacles returned to their main body as if the stretched rubber had returned to its original state.  </p>
<p>「Kuh!  What did you...  do...! Komusume!」</p>
<p> Ronowe, who had regained his humanoid, shouted in agony as he clutched the area around his side.  A large amount of magic power was leaking out of the wound, which was slowly regenerating due to the divine attribute.  However, his burning red eyes were still filled with fierce hostility. He seemed to haven’t weakened his fighting spirit.  </p>
<p>「Uoaaaah!」</p>
<p>「I’ve seen it all already」</p>
<p>  and </p>
<p>「Gyiiiii!」</p>
<p>  When Ronowe’s arms transformed into thin tentacles, each of them attacked Fran with different movements.  In addition, their hair spread out at once and became purple smoke.  It was an all-around attack using tentacles and poison. If it had been unleashed as it was, not only Fran but also the villagers would have been affected.  But Fran did not allow that.But Fran did not allow him to do so.  The tentacles had been cut down by countless slashes, and the poisonous fog had been obliterated by my thunder magic.  </p>
<p>「Higiiii!  Why!」</p>
<p>  Ronowe, who had lost both his arms and had tattered his hair, let out a scream of resentment.  Fran grimaced sadly as she watched Ronowe.  </p>
<p>「I will never forgive you!  I’ll kill you!  Die, die―― Gyii! Shiiiigaa!」</p>
<p>  Ronowe’s face contorted with fury and shame.  And I was blocked from him as he tried to spread the poison again.  Ronowe hadn’t given up yet.  I guess he had no choice but to cut down to stop him.  I could see that Fran was prepared.  She didn’t have the will to kill him as usual. But it seemed that she was ready to inflict lasting wounds. </p>
<p>「I’m sorry――」</p>
<p>「I won’t let you!」</p>
<p>  With a sad look on her face, she unleashed her slash. However, her blow was blocked by Fran’s scythe, which had intervened in between them.  </p>
<p>「Satia!  Get out of here!  You’re making too much use of the Crusher! You’re gonna die if you don’t!」</p>
<p>「...... But!」</p>
<p>  Even in her Demon Crusher state, Fran seemed to be still conscious of the caster.  Fran told Satia to run away. Satia herself didn’t seem to be planning to escape, but Ronowe was in charge of her body.  The demon immediately showed his back and began to run away in order to save his life.  </p>
<p>「Wait!  Ronowe! </p>
<p>「Sorry Satia」</p>
<p>「Frut.  If you want to run, I won’t chase you.」</p>
<p>「That’s a tall order!  Take my life as fuel and materialize it! Duke of Demon!」</p>
<p>  The overwhelming aura that even Ronowe had exuded was palpable.  Did he just say “Demon Duke”?  I’m a Baron with a threat level of B, you know? His body is probably more than five meters long, and the dragon’s head.  It had dragon-like wings growing on his back, making it look like a half-dragonkin. Even if it killed Fran, prince Fran must have decided to achieve his goal. The aftermath of the magic power released when it appeared was enough to cause a huge explosion.  The villagers were blown away.  </p>
<p>「Urushi!  Please!」</p>
<p>「Grrrr!」</p>
<p>「Don’t interrupt us!」</p>
<p>「Grrrr!」</p>
<p>  Fran swapped places with Urushi and sent recovery magic to the villagers.  Some of them were in quite dangerous conditions, but they managed to make it in time. They were unconscious, but no one was dead. Then, a loud scream echoed again.  </p>
<p>「Graaaaaah!」</p>
<p>「Frut?」</p>
<p> When Fran looked back, she saw a small knife stuck on the back of Beech’s head facing Urushi.  </p>
<p>『That guy... Wasn’t he a villager!?』</p>
<p>  It was one of the villagers who threw it. It seemed that Raydoss’s operatives or something was hiding his abilities and infiltrating the villagers.  As expected, he hadn’t appraised all of them individually.  I hurried to look at his status with the Heavenly Eye skill at full power, and found that all the skills that spies needed were of high rank.As expected, she hadn’t appraised all of them individually.  I hurriedly activated her Heavenly Eye skill to its full strength and looked at her stats.  All of the skills she needed for a spy, such as stealth, disguise, Acting, and Falsehood, were of high rank.  I couldn’t sense any killing intent when throwing a knife at her, so she must be quite skilled.  She quickly unleashed her telekinesis, but the operative dodged as if she could see it and turned her back and ran off.  </p>
<p>『Urushi! Follow the man!』</p>
<p>「Grr!」</p>
<p>『Fran, it’s Fran, it’s healing Fran!』</p>
<p>「I won’t let you get away!」</p>
<p>  Fran was trying to pull out the knife that was stuck in her back, but it seemed to have some kind of magical effect, so she couldn’t pull it out.  </p>
<p>「Guh...」</p>
<p>「Frut!」</p>
<p>「It’s no use.  This is just a technique to kill demons...He unleashed his telekinesis as quickly as he could, but the operative dodged as if he could see, and ran off with his back turned. </p>
