</div><h1>Chapter 1074</h1><p>Fran held me up in order to destroy the magic stone. Rather than swinging it, she folded her arms tightly and pulled back. It was not a slash, but a thrust stance. She concentrated all her power at one point. Fran quietly kneaded the magic power, and I used the Great Magic Beast and Evil Conquest to strengthen myself. As if to show how strengthened she was, my durability value was slowly starting to decrease as a high-pitched creaking sound like the blade creaked. It was a burden that made me think that the surface of the blade was being whittled away. Even so, I would continue to strengthen it. Even so, I continued to strengthen.  </p>
<p>「Fuuh...」</p>
<p> Fran meditated and took a long breath in front of the huge magic stone that she had one hand in her hand. </p>
<p>「Fuuh...―!」</p>
<p> The deeper she breathed, the more power was drawn from inside Fran.  And right after the long, deep breath, Fran’s eyes widened and thrust me out as if to put all her strength into it.  </p>
<p>「Haaaaaah!  Black Lightning God’s Claw!」</p>
<p>  Just like when she destroyed the magic stone weapon in the Belioth Kingdom, she activated the Black Lightning God’s Claw. However, what was different from that time was that it was under perfect control. Black lightning was concentrated on the tip of my blade, and it rotated like a drill. I, clothed in overwhelming power, was thrust into the magic stone――.  </p>
<p>「I did it」</p>
<p>『Ou!』</p>
<p>  It was hard to even scratch it, but this time it was a complete victory. Fran’s thrust broke the defense of the huge magic stone, and its tip pierced the magic stone completely.  Because Fran and I have grown up!  The huge magic stone was absorbed by me and disappeared.  </p>
<p>『Uwooorgh! It’s here!』</p>
<p> Now that you mention it, it was the same as before... A tremendous amount of magic power flowed into me, and my head almost went white.  But I’ve experienced it a few times already.  Besides, it’s not much different from when I absorbed two swords. I managed to keep my consciousness and calm my mind. </p>
<p>(Master, are you okay?)</p>
<p>『Yeah.  I’m fine』</p>
<p>(I see. I’m fine)</p>
<p>  Oioi, when I looked at my status, I found that my magic stone value was over 2000!  Seriously? The owner of this magic stone must have been a threat level of A or higher!  Moreover, my skill was strange.  I had acquired four strange skills.  Inferno Dragon Magic, Dragon Roar, Dragon Scale Form, and Dragon Scale Strengthening.  These magic stones must have belonged to the Flame Dragon.  Flame Dragon Magic, as the name implied, was the magic used by Flame Dragons. To be honest, I’d never had a magic that I didn’t know how to use even though I had acquired the skill.  Nothing came to my mind.  As for Dragon Roar, Dragon Scale Form, and Dragon Scale Strengthening, I couldn’t use them either. That must have been a skill that only dragons could use.  It wasn’t just me that was surprised.  </p>
<p>「Hahaha......  What the hell......?」</p>
<p>  Fran’s eyes widened in surprise and she immediately twisted her face in self-mockery.  Well, it couldn’t be helped if she reacted like that.  She must have judged that she couldn’t destroy the huge magic stone and tried to kill the villagers. Moreover, this caused her to antagonize Fran.  Well, it was also not good for the two demon knights to go out of control though. The clear killing intent of the two made Fran, who was already quiet, respond in her fighting mode. Besides, Fran and Satia took action in a panic when they were taken out of their countries and urged to hurry.  At the same time, Fran and Satia must have misjudged Fran’s abilities.  Judging from the criteria for what they had when they first met, Pune and Ronowe were much stronger than Ronowe. This was bad to say, but I guess they didn’t think that Fran could solve the situation by talking to them, and they thought that they could be captured without killing them.  What would happen if they told Fran everything from the beginning and asked her to cooperate?  It would have been a completely different ending.  </p>
<p>「... If you believe in Fran...  I’m sure you’ll have a different result...  Aah, how stupid things are... A-ahahaha」</p>
<p>  She seemed to be more frustrated at her trying to kill the villagers than at herself for being encroached on by the curse and dying.  </p>
<p>「... Fuh, about us...  Hah...  I’ll kick you off...」</p>
<p>「Frut!  I’ll do something about it! </p>
<p>「Okay, no......  Fran.  You, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, bring it on!」</p>
<p>「Gah......!」</p>
<p>「Frut!」</p>
<p>  Frut spit out an even greater amount of blood than before. His face was missing from the air.  Fran launched another series of healing spells, but the knife blocked his recovery.  However, if she forced her to pull out the knife, Fran would be seriously injured. In the first place, even a light touch would cause intense pain to Fran.  </p>
<p>「Then!」</p>
<p>  Fran holds me at her hips. She began to knead the magic, but it may be more concentrated than when destroying the magic stone. Just like that, she paused for a few seconds and became silent.  Fran then sank so deeply that it looked like she was collapsing on the ground, delivering a horizontal slash to Fran’s body.  There was no sound or impact.  However――.  </p>
<p>「Hmm?」</p>
<p>『Whoa!』</p>
<p>  Magic power flowed into me.  And at the same time, the knife disappeared. I was hoping that by destroying it, I would lose the knife’s ability, but...  </p>
<p>『Did you activate Cannibalism?』</p>
<p>  I don’t know everything, but the target of my cannibalism was an Intelligence Weapon or a failed Divine Sword. Maybe I could use a divine sword. A knife didn’t seem to have a will of its own, or, of course, it wasn’t a Divine Sword.  </p>
<p>『So, it was a Discarded Divine Sword...?』</p>
<p>  stats had barely increased.  Wasn’t it the weaker one as a Discarded Divine Sword?  However, I had acquired the skill.  Its name was </p>
<p>『Demon Slayer』</p>
<p>.  It weakened demons and doubled the damage to demons. </p>
<p>(Master?)</p>
<p>『Oops, I’ll explain it to you later. Let’s help Fran now.』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p>  The curse was still not broken, and blood was pouring out of her wound. Fran and I continued to use recovery magic with Divine Attributes and tried our best to help Fran somehow.  Then, a few minutes passed.  </p>
<p>『Did you manage to get it back on track?』</p>
<p>「Nn......」</p>
<p>  Fran used too much magic power to make her ghastly, but Fran’s face was reddish.</p>
<p>『Well then, what do we do now?』</p>
