</div><h1>Chapter 1011</h1><p>The hostility she exuded towards us, the voice of a woman who didn’t even want to hide her malice. It was clearly telepathy that shook my mind.</p>
<p>「...Juanaverta?」</p>
<p>『Don’t call me that rude little girl! Give me the sword, okay! You’re giving it to Trismegistus-sama, are you?』</p>
<p>「I won’t.」</p>
<p>『...Then let’s kill and take them! We can take power from the wreckage!』</p>
<p>The effect of jealousy on her original sin didn’t seem to matter if I was destroyed or not. She seemed to have a wider range of skills that could be used as targets than just her skill taker.</p>
<p>『What do you want to do? Master, what do you want to do? If you want to save the little girl, come to me by yourself』</p>
<p>『Do you see my name?』</p>
<p>They said it was excellent at information analysis, but it seems that they have seen through our information better than I had imagined.</p>
<p>『Yeah, how jealous...! How fearsome of power lies in that poor sword! That’s how great of an Evil Spirit! And how much potential it could grow even though it was just a sword!』</p>
<p>『Looks like you can see a lot of me inside』</p>
<p>『Of course! I am one with Trismegistus-sama! I can see everything my King sees!』</p>
<p>「The man has a skill called Dragon Eye. It seems to be a very powerful skill that allows him to see through anything. Moreover, Trismegistus is not able to leave the castle, but all of his abilities are increasing inside. All of my Divine Swords should have been completely stripped off.」</p>
<p>I was convinced when I heard Isario’s words. The feeling of seeing through something I felt when someone was staring at me. That must have been the feeling of using my dragonkin.</p>
<p>To be able to see through the power of the Divine Sword was at least above my Heavenly Eye. And it seemed that I was able to share that eye with Juanaverta.</p>
<p>「A piece of the Evil God with a Divine Beast and a labyrinth nucleus? It doesn’t look like a Divine Sword, but I can’t believe it」</p>
<p>『So, you’re saying they’ve seen it all coming!』</p>
<p>「Oi oi, young miss, Master. Seriously?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「That’s ridiculous...」</p>
<p>Isario, the wielder of the divine sword, was scurrying about. Well, to put it bluntly, it was certainly a creepy thing inside of me. Even Merritte, who was shrugging behind, was looking at me with a terrifying look.</p>
<p>『Then, don’t you understand? If you destroy me, the Evil God might resurrect you, you know?』</p>
<p>Now that they had been seen through, this would surely be their greatest threat. Even Juanaverta and Trismegistus would not be safe if we resurrected the pieces of the Evil God here.</p>
<p>They might not die because they were immortal, but if they knew that and resurrected the Evil God, they might be subject to Heaven’s punishment.</p>
<p>However, Juanaverta laughed loudly.</p>
<p>『Ahahaha! Well, that’s not it!』</p>
<p>Because of her beautiful voice, I could feel the sharp malice hidden in all her eyes.</p>
<p>『You don’t know anything about yourself, huh? Gufufu. They set the Divine Beast and the pieces of the Evil Gods to disappear against each other if the sword was destroyed. I guess it’s a safety device. It’s such a powerful technique, so I recognized it instantly』</p>
<p>I don’t know how Trismegistus’ eyes looked at me, but it seemed that he had a grasp on the system as well. Not even Alistair, a Divine-level blacksmith, understood that much.</p>
<p>I was a little relieved to learn that even if I was broken, the Evil Gods would not resurrect, but I could no longer be destroyed for Fenrir-san’s sake.</p>
<p>It’s also a problem that I can’t use my biggest threat now. And the fact that they’ve seen through me this well means that my equipment restrictions are exposed. Can I manage to convince them to use the method of getting them to be equipped?</p>
<p>Juanaverta smiled further as if he had seen through my thoughts.</p>
<p>『Kyahahaha! It seems that a lower Divine Punishment will be imposed if anyone other than the little girl is equipped with it, but I’m not sure about that either! I’ll let you through this!』</p>
<p>He’s talking badly. And madness was gushing out of every corner of his tone. He was able to have a conversation just in time, but when asked if he was crazy, I could only imagine that he was crazy.</p>
<p>Isn’t this treated as nothing crazy? Well, it’s better than the Fanatics though...</p>
<p>『The possibility of growing on my own, even though I’m a sword! Amazing! If I take away that power, I’ll be forever! I’ll be of use to Trismegistus-sama forever! It’s a shame for a dagger like it! As the best sword in the world, the sprouting of that possibility is worthy of me! So, bring it on!』</p>
<p>「Master is the greatest sword in the world!」</p>
<p>『Aah? What did you say?』</p>
<p>「No, you’re not the best in the world!」</p>
<p>『I’m not going to be kind to you anymore. I’ll kill you and destroy the sword! I’ve decided!』</p>
<p>「That’s what she says」</p>
<p>Trismegistus held up the Silver Falcion in response to his beloved sword’s words. It was completely at Juanaverta’s mercy. It was completely without a puppet-like subjectivity.</p>
<p>『Fran, I can’t beat this immortal. You get that?』</p>
<p>「......Nn.」</p>
<p>『Let’s get out of here. I know how frustrated you are, but we have no chance of winning.』</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>Fran switched quickly as she made the decision to escape. She flew backwards, keeping a great distance from Trismegistus.</p>
<p>However, her movements had become strange.</p>
<p>「Hmm? I’m not letting you go」</p>
<p>『Tsk!』</p>
<p>Trismegistus had closed the distance all at once. Exactly what he said, he must have intended to keep us out of the way.</p>
<p>However, there was a mass of fire rushing towards Trismegistus with tremendous force.</p>
<p>Trismegistus held up his hand to try to block it, but just before that, it exploded and filled the surrounding area with flames. The only ones who were not burned were Isario and Fran’s surroundings.</p>
<p>「Isario?」</p>
<p>「Young miss, run away. I’ll buy you time.」</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>Isario shrugged his shoulders and shouted further in response to Fran’s surprise.</p>
<p>「Even though he’s a Rank S adventurer, right? I can handle him if he’s alone. So, go at it!」</p>
<p>「...Okay」</p>
<p>Fran hesitated for a moment, but immediately nodded back at her. After seeing the determination in Isario’s eyes, she couldn’t help but waste her determination.</p>
<p>I also knew that I would be holding back if I were to fight seriously.</p>
<p>Fran looked frustrated and began to narrow her words down.</p>
<p>「You shouldn’t die.」</p>
<p>「I know.」</p>
