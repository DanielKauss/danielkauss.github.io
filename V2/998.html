</div><h1>Chapter 998</h1><p>「Ugyaaa!」</p>
<p>「Velmeria!」</p>
<p>「Graaaaaaah!」</p>
<p>『No! I haven’t heard your voice!』</p>
<p>「Kuh......!」</p>
<p> Fran called him, but Velmeria didn’t respond. He was completely mentally manipulated. Fran’s intention was to render him powerless without killing him, but it would be quite difficult. In fact, it should be easier to kill him. But I don’t think Fran will abandon Velmeria. </p>
<p>『...Fran. She has no reason, and she’ll come at full power. It’s not a good idea to prolong it.』</p>
<p> It’s not a good idea to prolong it.』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p> The current Velmeria and Frederick were willing to self-destruct and were in full throttle. Like in her Potential Release state, I could see that their life force had begun to dwindle even before the battle started.  If we were waiting to see what would happen to them, they might die on their own. They have to either knock them out as soon as possible, or damage them and hold them back until they can’t move.  I’m watching the movements of the robe guy, but he doesn’t seem to be looking at us at all. He seemed to be barely moving and concentrating on something.  Was he doing something with that sword?  Did he interfere with the nucleus in any way? Anyways, it wasn’t going to be easy.  However, he shouldn’t disturb us while we’re concentrating on that.  </p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>「Uruaaa!」</p>
<p> Fran activated her Brilliant Lightning Rush and went into her serious mode all at once, but Velmeria also stepped up a gear.  The speed was evenly matched, the power was higher than her, and Fran had the advantage in sword reach. Also, the evil temper that Velmeria wore must be a nuisance.  It began to radiate such a dense evil that it looked like you were an evil dragonkin.  The evil energy then disturbed my telekinesis and check magic, and canceled it out. If I put a lot of magic power into it, it wouldn’t be affected by the evil energy, but it drained a lot of mana.  It was the same evil energy as the dragonkin who attacked us along the way.  Is it even possible to subdue it? Maybe we can keep fighting until we die? Fran was moving really fast, firing black lightning, and Velmeria was moving at a speed beyond that while radiating blue mana.  It seems they weren’t serious yet.  No, I guess they pushed themselves even further in sync with Fran. The way Velmeria lost her life force has accelerated even further.  </p>
<p>「Ugyaaaaaah!」</p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>『All we have to do is take a single blow and our durability value will be taken away!』</p>
<p>  Because the Abyss Eater’s nucleus was filled with magic power, she couldn’t teleport.  That was why she couldn’t use emergency evasion. Urushi couldn’t hide in the shadows, and it seemed that he couldn’t participate in Fran’s high-speed battles.  Little by little, Fran had more time to defend. As I thought, she was not an opponent she could beat while holding back so as not to kill her.  Even though her physical abilities were increasing, her level of martial arts skills was still low, so Fran, who still had Swordking Mastery, could respond. However, if the battle was prolonged and she was exhausted, her balance would collapse at once.  Before that, she had tried appraising her many times to find a way out, but it didn’t go well. She was of a higher rank and her evil spirits were in the way. Nevertheless, if I used appraisal with the Divine Attribute even more than before, I was able to appraise Velmeria for a brief moment.  However, using appraisal over and over again requires a lot of magic power.  But it was worth the effort.  Name: Velmeria―― Race: Half―― Status: Domination, Evil Erosion, Divine Dragon―― Stator―― HP: 1029/2039 MP: 709/1233 Strength: 1258 Physical: 877 agility: 80――Skill soles: Lv7, Intimidation: Lv8, Super Strength Lv3, Threat Detection: Lv5, Fist Arts: Lv8, Fist Arts: LvMax, Fist Saint― Unique Skill Spirit Control, Super Dragon Scale――Extra Skill, Divine Dragon Form title, Blue Dragon God―― To be honest, I didn’t get half of it. However, I was able to confirm the important part.  </p>
<p>『Fran, Velmeria is still a Divine Dragon Form! That’s with her skills!』</p>
<p>(...! Skilltaker!)</p>
<p>『That’s right!』</p>
<p> We know that if you lose Ashwrath’s Mad Demonization, the change will be lessened if you lose your skills. There are some areas I’m interested in, like control, Evil Spirit Erosion, but if you lose the Divine Dragon Form, your fighting power will definitely decrease.  </p>
<p>『I’ve been saving this skill for times like this! Let’s use it!』</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
<p> I activated my skill taker on Velmeria. The invisible skill arm When I thought she had touched Velmeria’s soul, I immediately felt like I was trying to steal something.  </p>
<p>『Whoooa?!  I-Is it gonna work on me too!』</p>
<p>  As soon as I deprived her of the Divine Dragon Form, a tremendous amount of power erupted from inside me.  Was this the divine attribute? There was even more evil energy mixed in.  It seems that the strengthening of my skills was extended to me as well. So, it didn’t have to be the same for non-dragonmen.  The Mad Demonization was the same, but if I steal the skill I activated, it will belong to me in my activated state.  </p>
<p>『Fran!  Urushi! In its current state!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  Fran’s kick blew Velmeria away. Velmeria, who had lost her Divine Dragon Form, was no longer Fran’s enemy.  Urushi’s paws attacked Velmeria, who was about to get up, and my land magic sandwiched Velmeria, who was knocked away again.  In addition, I suppressed her with telekinesis to hinder her movements. She would start moving soon, but that was enough for now.</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
