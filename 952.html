</div><h1>Chapter 952</h1><p>After we finished listening to her Divine Sword, we parted ways off from the Silver Lady and headed to the Adventurers Guild. We asked the Silver Lady to keep an eye on Nadia’s situation. She didn’t seem to be concerned about Nadia as a stranger to her, so she accepted the request in half. She was very fighting and had the mobility. She probably had enough time in the morning to carry Nadia and run away when the time came. We’ve managed to get rid of the antidemons around Brutori, and our work here is over already. We can leave for Nocta tomorrow. Fran wanted to see Nadia as soon as possible. Fran wanted to see Nadia as soon as possible. She was walking towards the guild quickly.  There was something blocking her way though. Well, I did hear that she just called out to them normally at the entrance of the guild, but the problem was who she was.  </p>
<p>「Hey, young miss. Are you going to the Adventurers Guild from now on?」</p>
<p>「... Nn」</p>
<p>  It was Adel and a group of Silard who spoke to her.  Ader didn’t look pale, and at first glance, he looked just like usual.  However, his movements were slower than this morning, and he was clearly holding back. This must be another pride of the great country.  I had wanted to avoid it, but I couldn’t do anything when he was waiting at the entrance. I tried to hide my presence as much as possible and slip past it, but it seemed that Fran was after all.  It was just right after the Silver Lady warned me, so I couldn’t help but wonder what kind of trick that was.  </p>
<p>「You’re a beautiful magic sword, aren’t you? Where did you get it?」</p>
<p>「... Master」</p>
<p>「Hou?  You have inherited it from Master?」</p>
<p>  The expressionless expressionless in battle and the empty smile that she made right now.  Even though their expressions were completely different, both of them had the same impression. Maybe it was because they were brainwashed, but it seemed that it was not normal for them.  </p>
<p>「You don’t trust the Militant Nation of Hagane. That country is a country that doesn’t think people are people and has evil in it」</p>
<p>「Hmm~」</p>
<p>「We’ve seen a lot of pitiful soldiers. It’s a country that forcibly drafts and destroys old people like them」</p>
<p>  You guys shouldn’t be talking about it.  Besides, how pitiful those old people were when they were forced to be recruited? They looked like they volunteered themselves, full of motivation, didn’t they?  Fran listened to Ader’s words with a lack of motivation. Meanwhile, only Addle spoke, and the men standing behind her stared back at us.  But they were not just waiting.  I could feel a slight movement of magic power. Maybe they were members of the human resources exploration group that used appraisal.  However, their expressions quickly changed to show contempt for us. Perhaps they realized Fran’s abilities through appraisal and recognized her as a small fry.  </p>
<p>「... Well then, my apologies」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>  Adoll judged that Fran was worthless to use because the men behind her didn’t say anything. They didn’t complain because they were grateful to us, but it was normal rude, right? I wonder if they were planning to be secretly active with that.  Anyone with a discerning eye would notice how suspicious they were if they lost their information. They were troublesome, so they wouldn’t actively complain or point out anything suspicious like us. As a result, he didn’t notice his unnaturalness and remained so.  Besides, I’m sure Ader knew how good Fran was, but... He never said that out loud.  </p>
<p>『Hmm, I don’t know if she’s scary or stupid. I can tell that their coordination is not going well though』</p>
<p>(I hate them)</p>
<p>『Well, it was a great help for us to lose interest』</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>『I’ll do my best to avoid meeting them as much as possible in the future』</p>
<p>(Okay)</p>
<p> After that, we went to our original goal of returning to the guildmaster...  But there, an unexpected person was waiting for us. To our surprise, Replare, the guildmaster of Nocta, was waiting for us.  The greetings were not too bad, Replare told us why she had come to Brutori. And the supplement was the master of Brutori. </p>
<p>「Request to investigate?」</p>
<p>「That’s right. It’s obviously different from the usual. There are too many powerful individuals.」</p>
<p>「So we have decided to send someone to the center of the continent to investigate」</p>
<p>「That’s for a small group of elites to scout out the situation.」</p>
<p>  Fran had been requested by the guildmasters to nominate her.  It was a direct request from the guild. They could not refuse without a good reason. Fran was motivated, although she could do so due to exhaustion and lack of geographical information.  She probably didn’t feel bad about being asked to do so, and the anomaly on this continent was directly related to Nadia’s safety. She would be happy to accept the request if her work had the potential to eliminate the anomaly.  </p>
<p>(Master. </p>
<p>『Well, it’s a investigation......』</p>
<p>  We didn’t care much about the destruction of the commander or anything, but the investigation request was completed once the investigation of a certain area was complete, regardless of whether the results were achieved or not. If we refused, there was no doubt that our evaluation would go down.  </p>
<p>「Are you going alone?」</p>
<p>「No, you’ll have to go with Isario-dono alone.」</p>
<p>  If we stayed with Isario, he might get caught up in Ignis... But he’s not the kind of person who would attack us on purpose, and if push comes to shove, we can always use teleport to keep our distance.  With Isario, we’ll be quite safe against strong antidemons.  In fact, the benefit was greater.  Fran seemed to be expecting from her to warn her of scouting. If things were to get worse, we could leave Isario behind and Fran could return to report it on her own.  </p>
<p>「...... What about those guys from Silard?」</p>
<p>「They’ve already achieved their quota, and they’re not guild members.  It’s a bit too much to ask them to do some research.」</p>
<p> I thought I’d refuse if I would be working with Addlers any more, but my main concern was gone.  </p>
<p>「Okay. Then I’ll accept the request.」</p>
<p>「What happened to Silard?  Well, I haven’t heard any good rumors yet.」</p>
<p>「I haven’t done anything yet.」</p>
<p>「Hey......  If anything goes wrong, come to us, okay? They’ll take care of it for you」</p>
<p>「Please do when that happens」</p>
<p>「Ufufu, leave it to me.</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
