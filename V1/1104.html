</div><h1>Chapter 1104</h1><p>Fran left the feudal lord’s building and immediately searched for signs of intruders.</p>
<p>「...There’s a lot of people over there」</p>
<p>『I guess those adventurers are still following the undead.』</p>
<p>I could feel the presence of many people moving around on the west side of town. However, this was not the kind of movement that would make me feel like I was cornering someone.</p>
<p>I guess they were still in the searching process.</p>
<p>As I was thinking about how to move in front of the feudal lord’s building, Fran and Urushi suddenly braced themselves.</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>「Grrrr」</p>
<p>I also immediately switched my thoughts so that magic could be shot at me.</p>
<p>『Just now, someone was watching us.』</p>
<p>(Nn, similar to how I felt outside of town.)</p>
<p>『That gaze huh...?』</p>
<p>The gaze I felt for a moment when we entered Alessa. I’m sure it was the same person who was watching us now.</p>
<p>At first, I thought it was Klimut’s spirit, but apparently, it was not. My spirit detection and Fran’s intuition were both different.</p>
<p>『But how?』</p>
<p>The first thing I felt was clearly from outside the town. It would be strange if this were an intruder.</p>
<p>After all, there must have been a commotion at that time that the undead had already entered. There were at least two enemies, an observer and an intruder?</p>
<p>「We’ll be on the wanted list if you do that, you know? And don’t forget about the diversion plan using the people from the Kingdom of Shallus」</p>
<p>Anyway, we decided to move in the direction we felt for a moment.</p>
<p>Leaving the movement to Urushi, Fran and I concentrated on detecting our presence. We deployed our magic and skills to the fullest and distributed our consciousness over a wide area.</p>
<p>I was sure they were looking for us like that, but we didn’t get any results. From time to time, we spotted suspicious presences, but they were fire robbers or failed adventurers.</p>
<p>They were punished, tied up, and rolled over to us. We could catch them if the incident was resolved.</p>
<p>I felt their gazes a few times since then, and they moved toward the source of it, but the enemy was still nowhere to be found. They must have moved immediately after they felt that we had been spotted.</p>
<p>(Just like Esmeralda)</p>
<p>『What? No, certainly』</p>
<p>Fran was right. Maybe we could do the same if we used Esmeralda’s sand magic. In other words, the enemy may be manipulating something to keep an eye on it, while the main body of the enemy was hidden.</p>
<p>(I think he’s purposely bullying us onlookers and luring us in a different direction)</p>
<p>『I-I see』</p>
<p>If she was an opponent with similar abilities as Esmeralda, the fact that she was nowhere near the source of her gaze was the matchup point. As Fran said, her gaze was probably bluffed and guiding her in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>『Tsk. It might be more troublesome than expected』</p>
<p>(Nn. Do you know?)</p>
<p>『Wait a minute.』</p>
<p>They looked back at their movements as they were led. They seemed to have been led to the east and south sides, and adventurers of Rank C and higher were gathered on the west side. They were probably also led by their gazes.</p>
<p>The rest was the north.</p>
<p>On the northern side, which was close to Raidos, undead were on the rise, and many adventurers were gathered for defense. Adventurers were expected to come and go outside of the city walls because of the transportation of supplies and injured people.</p>
<p>I subconsciously thought that was the way to do that, but... A strong and capable opponent might be able to hide in the middle of a lower-level adventurer.</p>
<p>『It’s the north. Let’s go to the north side』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>We ignored our annoying gaze and started moving toward the north at once. There were so many people that it was quite difficult to find any sign of us. If we wanted to hide the trees, we might have to go through the forest.</p>
<p>However, both Fran and Urushi had excellent senses. They were able to sense any suspicious presences in no time. In fact, they already had experience, so they were able to smoothly find any suspicious places.</p>
<p>As we headed to the place where Fran and Urushi felt suspicious, I found out too.</p>
<p>『This feeling... It feels like we’re with Hydeman』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p>(Woof!)</p>
<p>That’s a feeling similar to that of Hydeman, the leader of the Black Skeleton Army we defeated at the royal capital, specializing in stealth. I know he’s there, but I can’t find the source.</p>
<p>『It must be this warehouse. Let’s shoot them at the purification magic first』</p>
<p>「Okay!」</p>
<p>Then, the same scene as the Royal Capital repeated itself. This time, the only thing that happened was an area undead return.</p>
<p>「Woooof!」</p>
<p>「Okay」</p>
<p>『Hydman......?』</p>
<p>Appraisal showed that he was a Hydeman. However, his appearance was not the same though. He was a zombie much smaller than the Hydeman in the Royal Capital. Both his skills and status were a little different.</p>
<p>「Little girl! Shit again!」</p>
<p>『Another suicide bomb huh!?』</p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>Perhaps in order not to get any information, they activated the suicide bomber. Fran and I attacked Hydeman just like the Royal Capital and prevented an explosion......</p>
<p>「I didn’t get any info.」</p>
<p>『No, I know one. That guy clearly knew Fran, so it’s not the information we asked him. Apparently, it was the same as Hydeman in the Royal Capital.』</p>
<p>「I see」</p>
<p>Was it because multiple people share the same memory, or could they be resurrected by replacing their bodies...? Anyway, it was certainly true that Hydman hadn’t been killed yet.</p>
<p>That class of stealth was immortal, and it was much more terrifying than an enemy that we were not good at...... But will the Royal Capital be okay in the first place?</p>
<p>I searched for Hydman’s body, which had lost its head. The robe was a magic tool that gave him stealth ability, so I guess we could mass-produce it. However, it seemed to limit the number of wielders, so it was unlikely that we could use it.</p>
<p>And one item bag. I knew it, its wielder was limited. I considered opening it at exhaustion, but Fran told me she wanted to go to the city wall first.</p>
<p>「Let’s go to everyone!」</p>
<p>『Yeah, let’s take care of the undead first.』</p>
