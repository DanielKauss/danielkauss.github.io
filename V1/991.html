</div><h1>Chapter 991</h1><p>Looking up at the castle from the foot of the hill, we saw a blonde blonde dragonkin standing there. You could tell how well he looked even from here.</p>
<p>Because of the aura of the Abyss Eater, I couldn’t sense any man’s magic power. However, I could tell from his appearance that it was not just any man.</p>
<p>「Trismegistus?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. It may look meek at first, but don’t be fooled by its appearance」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>It was not even that Frederick advised him to do so. Even from this distance, we could tell the extent of his abilities.</p>
<p>The adventurers, who had stepped foot into the hill at Isario’s urging, all reacted the same way. First they were horrified at the presence of the Abyss Eater, and then they noticed Trismegistus through Fran and the others’ eyes.</p>
<p>It was the first time they had seen Trismegistus in person, and they looked surprised as well.</p>
<p>The golden dragonkin didn’t move. They stared at us as if he was trying to get up fast.</p>
<p>「Isario, where are you going?」</p>
<p>「This is his castle. We can’t just ignore it」</p>
<p>「But I don’t know where he is right now. Don’t let your guards down」</p>
<p>Frederick glared up at the golden dragonkin. His eyes were probably on something calm because of his suspicions about the connection between Trismegistus and the Dragon King.</p>
<p>There was no sense of hostility in Trismegistus’ golden eyes. But he did not seem to welcome her.</p>
<p>「......Let’s go.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>After all the adventurers had calmed down, Isario started climbing the stairs. Everyone was nervous.</p>
<p>A variety of emotions must be swirling around in front of the legendary great sinner.</p>
<p>But without any traps that everyone seemed to be wary of, the group climbed up the stairs.</p>
<p>「Welcome. Red lotus blade. Welcome.」</p>
<p>「Outta of my way.」</p>
<p>「Like what I like. This is the first time I’ve seen anyone other than the disciple of the Red lotus blade and the priestess, right? I am the sinner Trismegistus.」</p>
<p>She looked important. Well, it couldn’t be helped since she was a former king, right? But she didn’t feel sorry for being punished by the gods.</p>
<p>Blonde hair, blond eyes. Her skin is pale as if it had nothing of blemishes. Not only the horns, but even the scales that grew on the back of her hands and the rice bran are shining like refined gold.</p>
<p>At first glance, he seemed to be a gentle man, but he was tall and surprisingly muscled. I guess that was the word used to describe a person like him that acted as a picture.</p>
<p>Besides, he said that it was because of the spirit of a monster, but it wouldn’t look that way to me.</p>
<p>I know that he’s ridiculously strong.</p>
<p>Not only was he skilled in martial arts, but the magic power that resided within him was definitely high among the dragonkin we’ve ever seen. He was probably quite good at both close and long range combat. Depending on his magic skills, he could have been a Rank A adventurer or even more.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, dragonkin also had a strength-oriented side similar to beastmen. Their king was probably one of the strongest warriors in their family.</p>
<p>Perhaps he was a so-called genius because he was one of the world’s leading alchemists in this field.</p>
<p>Fran was apparently caught by Trismegistus’ words.</p>
<p>「My apprentice as a priestess? Who is she?」</p>
<p>「Hmm」</p>
<p>「......!」</p>
<p>Trismegistus’ golden eyes stared at Fran. There was no sign of skill or magic. Yet, there was a strange feeling as if he could see through everything.</p>
<p>Fran seemed to be sensing this and was holding herself back. She hadn’t been confirmed as an enemy, so she managed to put up with it. But it looked like she was about to touch me at any moment.</p>
<p>「This is my castle, and not mine. I have no intention of refusing to come, but it is worthless to remain hidden, is it not?」</p>
<p>「Woof?」</p>
<p>What have we done? Immediately after Trismegistus looked down at Fran’s shadow, Urushi came up from the shadows with a confused scream.</p>
<p>There was no doubt that Trismegistus had dragged Urushi out of the shadows. But I had no idea what he had done.</p>
<p>I don’t know what kind of magic or skill it was, but it seemed that she didn’t even want to attack it, she just wanted to check what Urushi was hiding.</p>
<p>「Is he a wolf?」</p>
<p>She nodded happily and immediately looked away.</p>
<p>『Urushi, are you okay? Can you tell me what you’ve done?』</p>
<p>(W-woof?)</p>
<p>Like I thought, Urushi himself didn’t seem to know about it either. It was so mysterious that I couldn’t even guess it.</p>
<p>They were already strong, but they were immortal due to their mysterious power. The danger level of Trismegistus in me was raised to Rank S.</p>
<p>I didn’t sense his presence, but his gaze turned to Fran again.</p>
<p>「Oh, the one I asked her. The priestess’ younger brother is one evil dragon――no, a half evil dragonkin, right? That one. He has a terrifyingly evil spirit, but I will never forget his face. Isn’t he the younger brother of Tilanaria, the priestess of the Fire God Dragon?」</p>
<p>「Yeah... Did you remember me?」</p>
<p>Frederick was strangely surprised. It seems that what he remembered in Trismegistus’ memories was something that he had not expected.</p>
<p>They were legendary, even if it meant bad things to them. I guess we couldn’t help but be surprised when they recognized us.</p>
<p>But by Frederick being the disciple of the priestess of the Fire Dragon God, did he mean that he was the younger brother of Velmeria’s mother?</p>
<p>「Frederick and Velmeria, relatives?」</p>
<p>「To a small extent. However, I’ve been erased because I’ve become a half-evil dragonkin. Thanks to that, I became the guardian of Velmeria.」</p>
<p>Originally, it was possible for him to take his position as a disciple of a priestess. However, because he became a half-evil dragonkin, he was no longer able to stay on this continent, and he was sent to the Kingdom of Kranzel as Velmeria’s escort.</p>
<p>I’ve always had a subtle feeling about the relationship between the two, but I guess they were Master and disciple in combat magic, as well as uncle and nieces. That must be what a normal escort was really like.</p>
<p>「...Velmeria and the priestess must be here.」</p>
<p>「Hmm? Come to think of it, Georg and the others brought Tilanaria and the girl with them, didn’t they? If that’s the case, then there’s still another one」</p>
