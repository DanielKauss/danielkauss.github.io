</div><h1>Chapter 1015</h1><p>It was Seliadot’s ward that saved Fran. </p>
<p>「Black Lightning Princess, get out of here!」</p>
<p>「What about Seliadot?」</p>
<p>「I’ll hold that back here.」</p>
<p> The lorelei girl looked up at the antidemons, her face filled with hostility towards them and determination. </p>
<p>「Are you not working for Merritte?」</p>
<p>「No, that’s not it. I exchanged the wards with the help of my kin, but I didn’t expect you to do anything about it......」</p>
<p> We exchanged the wards with the help of our kin, but I didn’t expect them to do anything about it......」</p>
<p> The ward he gave Meritte had a call feature, and he used it to listen to our conversation with Meritte.  Therefore, he seemed to have some idea of what Meritte was trying to do. His shoulders slumped and he had a look of regret on his face.  </p>
<p>「I don’t have time to talk now! I’m coming!」</p>
<p>「Uuurgh!」</p>
<p>「Regression barrier―― Tch!」</p>
<p>  I thought Seliadot and Meritte were friends, but apparently, they were not. They tried to block the fist swung down by the giant antidemon and failed.  </p>
<p>「This way!」</p>
<p>『Orraa!』</p>
<p>  Fran jumped back with Seliadot in her arms, and with my telekinesis and magic, she slowed down her fist slightly.  Was this just barely enough? I had forcibly kneaded my magic to activate my telekinesis.  A huge black creature rained down from above, covering the antidemon’s fist. The weight and impact of it changed the trajectory toward the ground.  </p>
<p>『Urushi!  Well done!』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  It was the larger form of Urushi.  He took advantage of his large mountain-like body to bite into the arms of the giant antidemon and seal its movements. But it probably wouldn’t last long.  His huge body was over 30 meters long, but it was still not as big as an antidemon.  After all, he was not as big as a high-rise building. In front of it, even Urushi was only the size of a small dog. Urushi’s body was already about to be lifted.  However, thanks to Urushi’s time, Fran and Urushi’s escape was complete. Even Urushi, who had seen it, had shrunk his body and left the front of the antidemon.  The antidemon seemed to be puzzled by the sudden disappearance of the giant wolf.  He was looking around with a puzzled look.  Apparently, it was too big to see anything close to his body. Fran and Urushi, who had distanced themselves from each other, finally joined up.  </p>
<p>「Urushi, you saved them」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>『What’s wrong with Velmeria and Frederick?』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  When I checked the direction Urushi showed with his nose, I felt a large number of mana coming from them. Apparently, they had deposited them with the second unit.  The second unit was quite far from the castle.  Was it Urushi’s instruction?  No, it was probably because he had sensed something strange when he saw Urushi’s condition. </p>
<p>『Let’s get away from here too』</p>
<p>「Nn. Urushi, Seliadot.  Let’s go.」</p>
<p> We can’t win by ourselves. Fran nodded her head in agreement, but Seliadot waited for us.  </p>
<p>「You lot need to get out of here.  I’ll lure them.」</p>
<p>「Are you sure you don’t want to run?」</p>
<p>「Can’t run away......?  What Meritte did is a mortal sin.  You might be punished by the gods.」</p>
<p>  Is that so? She manipulated the Abyss Eater to create a large number of antidemons, killing many innocent people.  As for me, I can’t forgive her for killing a lot of innocent people, but I don’t think the Gods would care. There are human Gods in the Gods, but there are also Beast and Insect Gods and the Gods of plants.  Outside of them, it can be said that the entire human race, which opens up forests, hunts beasts, and exterminates insects, has killed many other creatures. In the first place, Ashwrath and Isario took a lot of lives in human-to-human wars.  However, I’ve never heard that they were blamed by the Gods. Perhaps, as long as they don’t touch their territory, Gods are not involved in the killing and survival battles between living creatures.  The only problem here was that the Gods manipulated the Abyss Eater. Fragments of the Evil Gods were mixed in with the Abyss Eater, so it might be treated as a one-sided use of the Gods.  Besides, this continent was within the barrier that the Gods had set up. careless actions there may also be dangerous.  </p>
<p>「At the very least, we have to make sure that the other lorelei don’t get blamed」</p>
<p>  The same lorelei tried to hold back the mistakes that the lorelei made.  By doing so, they were trying to avoid Divine Punishment for the entire race. I don’t know if that would reduce them to zero, but it’s much better than not doing it. </p>
<p>「You don’t have to worry about me.」</p>
<p>「...... I’ll stay behind too.」</p>
<p>「Black Lightning Princess?  What are you saying!?」</p>
<p> Seliadot looked surprised.  The same went for me.  </p>
<p>『Fran! Don’t be ridiculous!』</p>
<p>(...... But!)</p>
<p> Originally, the lorelei and black cats were very similar in their circumstances and positions.  Moreover, seeing Seliadot’s determined expression made it impossible for her to leave them alone.  Seliadot was clearly planning to die. She had tried to risk her life for the sake of her race, but it seems that she has become one with herself.  </p>
<p>「Wolf and sword! You all must stop the Black Lightning Princess!」</p>
<p>「W-woof?」</p>
<p>『Eh? Sword......』</p>
<p>「I know the sword has a will of its own.  I heard the underground conversation. I had intended to take it to the cemetery, but it can’t be helped.」</p>
<p>  She said she was eavesdropping on Merritte’s conversation, but it seems that she has become more aware of us than I had imagined.  </p>
<p>「Black Lightning Princess.  You should run away.  And defeat him with the others.  Either way, if someone here is your decoy, it will be difficult to escape. So I’m perfect for that role.」</p>
<p>『...... Fran.  Let’s meet up with the others first.』</p>
<p>「......Then Seliadot, get together――」</p>
<p>「Hurry!  I’ve noticed!」</p>
<p>『Damn!』</p>
<p>  Just as Seliadot said, I saw a giant antidemon taking a step towards us. But at the same time, I noticed a new presence.  </p>
<p>「A lot of them.」</p>
<p>『The adventurers?』</p>
<p>「They’re coming too!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  It was the presence of a large number of people coming towards us.  They were undoubtedly the first and third troops. Apparently, they were looking for that huge antidemon.  Well, when we saw the huge antidemons that appeared with the anomaly, anyone could imagine that they were the culprit. The forces that had originally been gathered to fight the giant-type could not ignore him. I could clearly feel the presence of the strong who were assigned to each unit.  </p>
<p>「All we have to do is to endure until help arrives!」</p>
<p>『I’d rather have them run away though』</p>

<p> From Fran’s head, the two letters of escape had completely disappeared.</p>
