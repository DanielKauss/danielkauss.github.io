</div><h1>Chapter 1098</h1><p>「Kyaaaa!」</p>
<p>A scream from a servant woman inside would have echoed through the mansion. Now the invasion was exposed, but I don’t mind. Esmeralda was told to do it spectacularly in the first place.</p>
<p>The nobles of the Ashtner group were proud that they could not afford to take any severe punishment given the national crisis. We’ve had a lot of headlines up until now, but our goal was to warn them that we would crush them if they got any better.</p>
<p>That’s why we didn’t use the wards to silence the sound, and we spoke proudly in front of the gate as we entered.</p>
<p>「W-What are you――Ugh!」</p>
<p>『Yeah, merciless』</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>Fran gets electrocuted to knock the servant out. Well, maybe we just can’t kill this guy who’s officially recognized as an enemy?</p>
<p>I caught three presences with bloodlust lurking around. But the fact that I can detect them this easily suggests that they are not that skilled.</p>
<p>She’s not in a room where I think the Viscount is, but in the basement.</p>
<p>We ran through the mansion, knocking off some servants and soldiers. Then, at the back of the mansion, we had finally found a staircase to the basement. But when we went down, we found no one there.</p>
<p>Well, we’ll know about that too.</p>
<p>「Yes!」</p>
<p>Fran kicked the wall on her right, and a large hole opened to reveal the existence of the hidden room. Four people were hiding in it.</p>
<p>『I’m a Viscount』</p>
<p>It seems he was hiding here. Maybe he planned to spend the time by staying here?</p>
<p>『Fran, there are some documents in this room. I’d like to keep them as they are, so I’ll try to take them over as little damage as possible』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran nodded and already defeated the knight in a blink of an eye. The strongest in the mansion, yet no enemy of Fran.</p>
<p>After that, I beat up the Viscount with my telekinesis, and Fran sank a sorceress and her son, who looked like an orc, with a chopped neck.</p>
<p>The documents we obtained were back books and sales records of illegal goods. Some of them were in kind. However, there were no illegal slaves. Apparently, Marquis Ashtner lent them his name so that they could not stand out.</p>
<p>『Besides, I didn’t see any Raidos scout anywhere.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>There was no sign of him running away from the mansion, so he was probably not a spy from the beginning.</p>
<p>After that, Fran and Urushi went around to the nobleman’s mansions under Marquis Ashtner’s command and stepped in to capture them one after another.</p>
<p>They had already destroyed five of their houses.</p>
<p>At her first house, she learned that important people should escape to the basement. So, Fran started by looking for the basement and stepping on it.</p>
<p>Well, I didn’t get any hits other than at the start. Even so, I’ve been able to find a lot of things, such as hidden bookkeeping and illegal slaves.</p>
<p>In particular, Fran was looking for illegal slaves. Having spotted them in the second house, her main goal was to rescue them. She thought it was best to leave the nobles to the soldiers.</p>
<p>「Don’t worry anymore.」</p>
<p>「Y-yes」</p>
<p>「You want to try this?」</p>
<p>To my surprise, they allowed her to have curry as her meal. From Fran’s point of view, it was the most important thing she paid attention to.</p>
<p>In contrast to their kindness to the slaves, the mansion they had been hiding in was raining blood. I didn’t kill them just in time because I needed to get the information out of them, but the situation was quite miserable.</p>
<p>This must be the situation that Esmeralda was aiming for.</p>
<p>The sixth house was very obedient. Apparently, the other troops were also steadily conquering the mansion, and it seemed that more than ten families had already been clamped down on the entire Royal Capital. I guess the word has already spread. They thought it would be better to get caught obediently than to go against them.</p>
<p>It was just as Fran and Urushi were about to head for their next mansion.</p>
<p>「Please wait. I’ve got a message from Esmeralda-sama」</p>
<p>「I got in touch? When?」</p>
<p>「It’s now」</p>
<p>That’s what Blue said, but she didn’t seem to wear any communication magic tools. Fran tilted her head in confusion.</p>
<p>Then Blue held out something in her hand. It was covered with a small lump of sand.</p>
<p>「What’s this?」</p>
<p>「It’s Esmeralda-sama’s sand. It makes it possible for us to have a conversation through it. On the contrary, we can even see him from a distance」</p>
<p>The reason they called themselves Esmeralda in their ranks was probably because of the sand-based communications network. They scattered sand over a wide area, allowing them to monitor and communicate with each other.</p>
<p>Rather, it might be better not to move to concentrate on controlling the sand.</p>
<p>When Blue handed him the sand, Esmeralda’s voice reached me through Fran. It seemed that it was not a telepathy, but a bone conduction method of talking with sand vibration.</p>
<p>『Derick, we got some info from this guy. Now that you mention the name of a nobleman on that list, can you head there?』</p>
<p>「Did you let him get serious already?」</p>
<p>It’s only a few hours since we entrusted Dimitris to her, you know? I wondered if she had the help of Satya, but that doesn’t seem to be the case.</p>
<p>『Hahaha. You’ve been living a long time, so you know a lot of things. That guy seems to have trained in pain and drugs, but not so much in pleasure. Hahaha!』</p>
<p>She didn’t ask for the details, but it seemed that she had tortured him in a completely different way than normal. I knew that dark heads must have a lot of bad knowledge.</p>
<p>What Esmeralda was instructed to do was a baron’s mansion where Blue was said to have been Markless at all. It was Baron Noare, a plain and poor nobleman.</p>
<p>He said that his presence was so low that he had never been suspected before. That fact was actually because he was connected to Raidos. He probably didn’t have any relationship with Marquis Ashtner and acted together so that he wouldn’t be suspected when the time came.</p>
<p>The mansion stood quietly at the edge of the nobility district, a scene of commotion in many places. Due to the shadow of the royal castle, this was indeed a dark corner.</p>
<p>「Here?」</p>
<p>「Very well. And then there’s the mansion of Viscount Noare...」</p>
<p>Blue looked confused too. It really felt like a poor and low-ranking nobleman’s mansion and didn’t even have a gatekeeper. The walls were collapsed and the yard was not very well-kept. It was hard to believe that they were hiding a spy.</p>
<p>Still, Fran’s face was filled with motivation. I could feel some kind of presence, albeit faintly. I didn’t know who this person was, but I was sure that there was a being with considerable stealth ability. I guess a lot of wielders would say that they couldn’t tell the exact location at this distance.</p>
<p>『Urushi, please track them down if necessary』</p>
<p>(Woof woof!)</p>
<p>Urushi, who has not been very active in the Royal Capital, is very motivated. After all, his opponent seems to be specialized in stealth, and there is a possibility that he can escape from us.</p>
<p>We pushed open the door ourselves and patted the door to the mansion. The reason they were so arrogant was probably because they were intimidating us.</p>
<p>After waiting for a while, a maid appeared from within the mansion. It was a maid who seemed to have something a bit creepy about it, but...</p>
<p>「W-What is it?」</p>
<p>「We have heard a report of a spy from an enemy country that has escaped into this area. I’ll take him down.」</p>
<p>「Eh? Eeh?」</p>
<p>We had heard the exchange between Count Bailleys, who was still disguised as a soldier, and the maid, but this man really didn’t seem to know anything. However, I was convinced that something was definitely there somewhere in the mansion.</p>
<p>「Get back」</p>
<p>「W-Wait a minute!」</p>
<p>「I won’t wait.」</p>
<p>Fran stepped foot into the mansion, pushing the maid-san aside. Was the man with a puzzled look on his face as he came out from the back? Fran asked him a direct question.</p>
<p>「But where’s that Raidos scout?」</p>
<p>「W-What the hell...... What the hell’s wrong? There’s no way there’s a Raidos spy, right?」</p>
<p>『He’s lying again』</p>
<p>Aside from the maids, it seems that the baron knew about them.</p>
<p>Fran pointed me at the great magic beast.</p>
<p>「I know you’re here. Don’t lie to me and show me around, so I won’t have to die you know?」</p>
<p>「B-How rude of you! Despite being a poor Baron, my family is a noble――Gyaaah!」</p>
<p>「We’re under the orders of the government. It doesn’t matter if we’re nobles or not」</p>
<p>Aah, since she’s a member of Raydoss’s mercenary brigade, she’s recognized as an enemy since she’s always been in the top gear. Fran then questioned him again, looking down at the baron who was clutching his blood flowing in the thigh and moaning.</p>
<p>「I’ll ask you one more time. Where’s this Raidos spy?」</p>
