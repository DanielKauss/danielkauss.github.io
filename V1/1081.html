</div><h1>Chapter 1081</h1><p>The rescue of the water dragon went more smoothly than I had imagined. It seems that Maar’s presence in Fran’s mind was no longer alarming.</p>
<p>She stayed still as she cut through the chains and torso. It didn’t take her five minutes to free the two of them, huh?</p>
<p>They were spotted by Raydoss’s soldiers at the end of the match, but it was already too late.</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Kyuroo!」</p>
<p>Two water dragons screamed and produced huge waves. As a result, both of the former water dragonkin were capsized, causing great damage.</p>
<p>「Master! I can’t let you lose!」</p>
<p>The raging water dragon was going to annihilate the Raidos fleet at this rate. Seeing this, they must have panicked because they would have to take all of their prey away. Fran then rushed out.</p>
<p>『I won’t be able to use lightning magic because it’ll get a water dragon caught in it』</p>
<p>「Then I’ll cut you down!」</p>
<p>『Got it!』</p>
<p>I swung my blade, which had been transformed into a destroyer mode, and Fran and the water dragons attacked the Raidos fleet.</p>
<p>The large ship was also easily cut in half and set aside, ignited by its attribute sword. Some of them jumped out into the sea before sinking, but the surface of the sea was rough with water dragon magic, and it quickly sank into the air.</p>
<p>Fran’s slashes and the water dragon’s breath sank the Raydoss fleet one after another, and in less than half an hour, the great fleet of the Kingdom of Raidos turned into sea moss.</p>
<p>There would be no survivors.</p>
<p>I was wondering if they had any special forces to counter the strong, but they didn’t come out. Just as I was thinking that, a water dragon came up with something in its mouth.</p>
<p>「Who is this guy?」</p>
<p>「Kuhn!」</p>
<p>He offers us the body of a man in armor. I appraised it and found that he was a subdemon.</p>
<p>He was quite strong, a high-ranking magician who controlled storm magic. He was not very strong in physical terms, but his magical abilities were probably equivalent to those of an A-ranked adventurer.</p>
<p>Moreover, he must have high regenerative powers if he was a subdemon similar to Valusa.</p>
<p>Also, its armor was quite strong. It was made of orichalcon with barriers and floating skills. In addition, I could see that it was connected to the water dragonkin by magic power. Perhaps, with the supply of magic power from the water dragonkin, it could use magic power without limitation.</p>
<p>Isn’t this this a force to be reckoned with? They must be much stronger than I had imagined at sea.</p>
<p>However, thanks to Marl, the supply of magic power from the water dragonkin had stopped, and she suddenly sank the ship and rushed out. It seemed that the water dragons had attacked her just outside the ship and defeated her.</p>
<p>『......This has taken care of the fleet.』</p>
<p>「Next up is the Kingdom of Shallus!」</p>
<p>『Then they’re going to destroy the Kingdom of Shallus, aren’t they? Or to be more precise, they are the ground troops of Raidos that invaded from the Kingdom of Shallus』</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>Perhaps in Fran’s mind, the Kingdom of Shallus was treated as one of Raydoss’s friends, and if that was the case, they would be defeated.</p>
<p>However, if the country didn’t request us to attack them beyond the border, it would obviously be an international problem. intercepting them near the border would be to the very limit.</p>
<p>『But first, what should we do with the princesses?』</p>
<p>They were unconscious now, but when they wake up, they should be controlled by the slave’s collar. In some cases, they may even lose their mind and go on a rampage.</p>
<p>If I wanted to destroy a slave contract, the only way I could do that was to destroy it or overwrite it...... Since it was not freed, that must mean it wasn’t stored by the water dragonkin.</p>
<p>『Contract magic――No good huh?』</p>
<p>「Can’t you overwrite it?」</p>
<p>『Don’t get repelled. Someone with a higher skill level than me should be involved in the contract.』</p>
<p>「...Use your points to level up」</p>
<p>『......Okay. That’s all it looks like.』</p>
<p>The illegal slavers were a mortal enemy of Fran. So, if she wanted to save someone from such a person, Fran would do everything. And if she wanted to make her wish come true, she would have to earn a few self-evolution points.</p>
<p>『Let’s let’s get the contract magic ready first』</p>
<p>《Contract Magic has reached LvMax. Cursed Magic Lv1, has been added to the list of skills. Fran has earned a title and a contractor》</p>
<p>I’ve heard about it in the Belioth Kingdom before, that I got some arcane magic. How about this?</p>
<p>I decided to try using arcane magic. Like with contract magic, I only have one technique that I can use.</p>
<p>『Cursed!』</p>
<p>That gave me the clear feeling of interfering with the contract. It was not so much as overwriting, but rather as rewriting a part of the contract.</p>
<p>Maybe they would have completely destroyed the contract if it had been a lower-ranked opponent. Then, let’s try raising the level even further.</p>
<p>I leveled up one or two of them while looking at their feelings. And when I leveled up my arcane magic, I felt that I could completely destroy the contract between the princesses. To be honest, I might not be at the level yet, but I think I could go there with my best effort.</p>
<p>『The curse has been activated! I’ll destroy all of your contracts!』</p>
<p>「Do your best, Master」</p>
<p>『Yeah!』</p>
<p>There was a lot of backlash. My durability and magic power were being whittled down. Perhaps even a raw person would not have been able to get away with it due to the tremendous pain and wearyness. I think I was at the level of death.</p>
<p>『Doryaaaah!』</p>
<p>「Master is amazing!」</p>
<p>After I continued to use the arcane magic while withstood the backlash, in a matter of seconds the princess’ collar shattered, and all of her contracts had disappeared.</p>
<p>If it hadn’t been me, I would have had to raise the level of my curse magic.</p>
<p>「Master! I did it! After all, Master is super cool!」</p>
<p>『O-ou!』</p>
<p>I could feel Fran’s excitement. The slave collar, which symbolized despair for her, twisted head-on and destroyed it. Maybe my power felt like the light of hope. I should have remembered it earlier.</p>
<p>『From now on, I can help illegal slaves don’t care. I’ll remove any collars.』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
