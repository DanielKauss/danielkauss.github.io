</div><h1>Chapter 1012</h1><p>So Miss Hilt has been there, huh? It’s a good condition for adventurers to be able to act at a time like this. Master must be the one leading the way. That must be a good pair. I never thought I’d see two Intelligence Weapons in a place like this... No, maybe it’s because it’s such a place? The continent of Gordicia is the place where the Divine Swords antidemon monsters lurk. It couldn’t be helped if legends were to gather. </p>
<p>『Wait, little girl!』</p>
<p>『Wait, little girl!』</p>
<p>  A high-pitched voice echoed through the air. I knew that Trismegistus’ sword, Juanaverta, was an intelligence weapon, but this was my first time hearing a voice from someone like him.  I don’t know who was crazy for jealousy, but it was troublesome for any revenger, man, and woman. Legend has it that she was a calm and calm ice woman...  I never thought she was this crazy.  The cause was the original sin of jealousy. Possessing that skill must have been dominated by strong jealousy.  Originally, the skill called “sin” was a rare skill that only demons could possess. Moreover, the original sin only has a top-level demon.  The angry demon we fought in our previous battle in a dungeon of A class said something like that. He had been angry for a long time, and it was hard for us to hear him.  But why does Juanaverta have such a skill?  I’ve heard that he didn’t originally have such a skill. Well, I’ve heard that she was an Elf before her life, so it’s no wonder.  They fought against the demons who possessed the original sin of jealousy decades ago. And the original sin of jealousy took away a certain skill.  However, something unexpected happened. The skill she was trying to steal was too high, and the demon could not afford to pay for it.  The original sin of jealousy was said to be a skill that forced the exchange of skills between her and the other party to be equivalent. However, the risk was high, and if the price he presented was not worthy of the value of the thing to be taken away, the skill would decide the price on its own. This was quite a risk because the user may lose their life.  As a result, the price the jealous demon offered to us was the original sin of jealousy skill itself. Trismegistus was talking about this, and I don’t think he’s lying. I don’t think that man still has enough self-consciousness to tell a lie. But I didn’t know until that Juanaverta was about to go crazy because of it.  I’m not very good at ladies like that, but I have to buy her time to escape.  </p>
<p>「Hey.  Let’s have a little bit of fun with me, okay?」</p>
<p>『Hey puppy!  Retreat from there!』</p>
<p>「Call me a kid. As expected of an Elf.」</p>
<p>『You’re in a fight!』</p>
<p> It seemed like they were dominated by madness, but their thoughts were not going crazy.  </p>
<p>「Isario, goodbye.」</p>
<p>  It seemed that Juanaverta had instructed them to ignore me, who was troublesome. Trismegistus started moving around to bypass me. </p>
<p>「... Divine Sword Release! How can you ignore me!」</p>
<p>『Little priest! Don’t interrupt me!』</p>
<p>「Don’t let the enemy stop you when they tell you to! Flame dance!」</p>
<p>  From the start, I set fire to the flames with all my might. The bright red flames scattered around the perimeter as if it were a wave.  It’s not good for Fran-chan, but I’m sure she can fight with all her might by herself. After all, she can use all her power for her destructive power without holding back.  </p>
<p>「Uorraa!  Flame Blade!」</p>
<p>「That’s what I’m talking about, Isario」</p>
<p>「I’m praised without a word!」</p>
<p>『Master! You did good!』</p>
<p>  It seems that she succeeded in attracting hostility towards me. Trismegistus was only slightly burned, and Juanaverta was half-crazed. </p>
<p>『Kocute Suh!』</p>
<p>「Tch!  Flame Wall!」</p>
<p>  The alias of Fanaverta used the name of the ice woman.  So, she was really a user of ice and snow magic, huh? Moreover, she was at the top of it. When the ice storm was generated to freeze the whole area, the flames I released collided and a tremendous explosion occurred.  Even though it was a defensive technique, it was not evenly matched with the power of the Divine Sword.  As expected of an Intelligence Weapon.  Trismegistus was sneaking into it without a sound. He fell into the middle of a large amount of vapor and suddenly appeared behind us.  </p>
<p>「Kuh!  You suddenly turn to be an assassin!」</p>
<p>  Trismegistus was silent as he slashed at us, but I couldn’t sense any sign of him. It was able to hide all that presence.  If it hadn’t been for Ignis enhanced heat source detection, I might have been able to conceal it. Its stealth skills and sword arms were troublesome.  Having been fighting with the sword for many years, I am no match for its swordsmanship. I can once again tell that Miss Fran, who had been separated from this, is extraordinary.  But I’m also a Rank S adventurer for now!After years of fighting with her sword, I can understand just how extraordinary her sword skills are.  After all, Miss Fran was still separated from her.  But I’m still a Rank S adventurer, so there’s no way I can’t afford to lose to my junior!  </p>
<p>「As expected of a Divine Flame.  You can easily ignite and melt my defenses.  Besides, if it’s only for defense, I’ll exceed you」</p>
<p>「We can’t just lose easily by using a Divine Sword!」</p>
<p>  While handling his sword, the flames released from Ignis burned Trismegistus. The other side was also putting up a barrier, but it was meaningless in front of the Divine Flame.  My magic power clashed with my Divine Flame, and an impact and flame heat swirled around me. The whole area around us was beginning to show a hellish appearance.  Even Miss Fran wouldn’t be able to survive if she was caught up in this. Trismegistus’ whole body is starting to swell, but he remains calm.  As expected of an immortal.  I never thought he would stay still in this state!  After all, we have to get serious!  </p>
<p>「Nice thing, just die for now! Die just now, Flame!」</p>
<p>「Oh.  You’ve never seen this style before, right?」</p>
<p>「Ha!  Even your proud eyes couldn’t seem to be able to see through this technique, right?」</p>
<p>「Indeed. It’s a Divine Sword.  I heard that she couldn’t see everything」</p>
<p>  What I used was one of my trump cards.  The Divine Sword Art, “The Flame Body”.  Well, the key was the technique of turning my body into a Divine Flame. Right now, I was just like a Divine Flame in human form.  The enemy’s attacks were obeyed, and on the contrary, the Divine Flame spread with a slight touch. Normal humans would not be able to erase it, only ashes.  </p>
<p>「Hmm」</p>
<p>「You can easily erase it with a little effort!」</p>
<p>「That’s not it. You’ve used a lot of Divine Attributes」</p>
<p> Trismegistus was able to use Divine Dragon Form.  If he could handle the same kind of divine attribute, he would be able to deal with it. But this technique was not just for defense and counterattacking, you know?  </p>
<p>「Orra!」</p>
<p>「When did you? I didn’t sense any magic coming from it.」</p>
<p>  The essence of the flame body was its ability to assimilate the flames that spread around it. It didn’t just absorb flames and heal them.  It could even appear wherever there was flames.  But rather than teleport, it was as if all the flames were me and I could be found everywhere. From their point of view, it would look like a teleport without any preliminary movement or preparation.  A large number of flames had already scattered around them, and they were fighting in flames. In this situation, it was next to impossible to catch my movement.  </p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>『My Lord!  Stop, little kid!  This!』</p>
<p>「That’s not enough to stop you」</p>
<p>  He appeared from anywhere and his blade covered with Divine Flames.  No matter how legendary his opponent was, he had no intention of falling behind. Even the ice and snow magic that Juanaverta unleashed was blocked by the flames and disappeared.  </p>
<p>「Let’s return to the throne―― Whoa?!  What the hell is this!」</p>
<p>  The antidemons we had been fighting earlier are emitting extraordinary magic power.  They were trying to delay us because they didn’t move, but they failed to defeat us in the aftermath of our battle. In fact, they have become even stronger.  Where is this young lady, like Meritte?  I can’t detect her because of the sudden swelling of the antidemon’s presence!  </p>
<p>「It looks like she has finished her preparations」</p>
<p>「Are you ready? What are you trying to do!?」</p>
<p>「The creation of an antidemon is more powerful than ever. The vessel-forming antidemons should be defeated first.」</p>
<p>  What are you saying?  Creation of the strongest antidemons?  This is against Trismegistus’ goal, right?  And yet, why don’t you stop!? </p>
<p>「What are you plotting?」</p>
<p>「I always have one goal.」</p>
<p>  I don’t understand, but it’s not right! The antidemons are beginning to grow huge! </p>
<p>「Can’t you see it differently?」</p>
<p>「Gugah!」</p>
<p>  I was in the middle of the flames, and that’s when I got hit by the damage!  Mastering the divine attribute perfectly!</p>
<p>『I’ll make effective use of that divine sword!』</p>
