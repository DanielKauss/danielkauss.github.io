</div><h1>Chapter 1115</h1><p>We handed the mysterious stick sword to Klimut and went straight to save his life. Klimut and the knights were still moving, but the more hands we had, the better.</p>
<p>We went around the affected areas to rescue living people. Many of them were just barely saved. Also, the number of casualties was smaller than I had expected.</p>
<p>It was thanks to the fact that many people who were originally under Marquis Ashtner’s command were captured, and there were only a few people in the noble district, and those who remained had escaped to the basement.</p>
<p>Once we had completed our rescue, we would now deal with our enemies. Actually, Klimut had asked us to look for and defeat any enemies lurking in Alessa.</p>
<p>Well, we could just leave the search to Klimut and destroy it later.</p>
<p>When it was attacked by Hydeman, the Great Spirit seemed to have remembered its magic power well. Then, it discovered that several beings that had the same kind of magic power were hiding in Alessa.</p>
<p>I didn’t know there were even more Hydman than the Item Collectors...... Maybe they were the kind of guy who would think there were ten of them in one go?</p>
<p>Klimt didn’t move from his spot and in an instant he found Hydeman hiding inside Alessa, so the Great Spirit’s ability to search for him was tremendous.</p>
<p>It seems that for the Great Spirit, it was only around the town level.</p>
<p>As a result, we followed the spirit’s lead and eliminated the three Hydmans.</p>
<p>It seems that Hydman had the ability to split his soul, put it into multiple undead, and manipulate them at the same time.</p>
<p>Since they were the same being, they share memories and abilities with each other. However, the strength and skills seemed to change depending on who they were and how big they were when they were split.</p>
<p>What was terrifying was the ability of the Great Spirit’s eyes to see the essence of the other party. With the ability of the Great Spirit to gather information, Klimut’s analysis, and appraisal, we could leave the other party completely naked.</p>
<p>Still, I didn’t know what it was.</p>
<p>No one would dare to speak up, and the Great Spirit didn’t give us any detailed information about the situation.</p>
<p>He said that he had just made a contract with the Great Spirit, and the reason why he was concerned about it was not complete. Even if he was talking to a Great Spirit, he was too worn out to communicate for a long time.</p>
<p>However, the spirits were strangely concerned about it, so the Great Spirit forced Klimut to take them away by force.</p>
<p>There was something hidden within it that even spirits were concerned about, and the ruined country may have used it to summon the Great Spirit.</p>
<p>In the end, we ended up not knowing what it was. If Klimut and the Great Spirit were storing it, it would be the safest way to go.</p>
<p>Just like Hydeman attacked us again, the current Klimut had regained its power befitting of an A-ranked adventurer. Even if Fran and I attacked him in surprise, we didn’t know if we would defeat him or not.</p>
<p>The best thing for us was probably Fran’s improved level in Spirit Magic. It seemed that her communication with the Great Spirit of Wind and Marl had become her training in Spirit Magic.</p>
<p>The other harvest would be the item bag that Hydman and the others had brought with them.</p>
<p>The item bags possessed by Hydeman and the others were difficult to open because it seemed that a very high-ranking magician had a contract with them. Well, we’ve spent a lot of time trying to pull it open though!</p>
<p>Everything inside was the same, a detailed map of Alessa and two magic tools.</p>
<p>The first was a dagger attached to Klimut. In addition to its magic power absorption ability, it was imbued with evil energy. When the effect was activated, the evil energy was released all at once, and an evil blade was created for ten seconds.</p>
<p>It seems that by disrupting magic and barriers with evil energy, it is possible to gain considerable penetrating power. Klimt is frowning, but it is an interesting item for me.</p>
<p>After all, they could use the Evil Spirits provided by the Evil God Fragments not as a barrier, but as a way to break the opponent’s defenses. But I don’t think they can be used that often.</p>
<p>Evil Spirits was a power that people hated. That’s why I had to use Evil Spirits as a last resort. That’s why I’ve been using Evil Spirits a lot lately. The Beast and Insect Gods had told me that I could ask for help from the Evil God Fragment if I had a contract or permission, but I’ll weight myself a little more. Well, it’s fine since I was Klimut this time, but it would be troublesome if it was witnessed by a bad person.</p>
<p>And the other magic tool that came in the item bag was a magic tool like a combo baton for looking for people.</p>
<p>Looks like it only had a limited set of abilities, so it was completely specialized in finding Klimt’s location. I’m pretty sure that’s because all the needles pointed at him.</p>
<p>It seems that he had been targeting Klimut for quite a while now. Not only did he have a mysterious stick sword hidden behind him, but he was also one of the biggest walls in Alessa’s attack.</p>
<p>If they could get the Great Spirit to go out of control while eliminating Klimut, it would be able to make three or four beasts with one stone. They probably thought it was worth making a special magic tool for it.</p>
<p>「Amanda, are you okay?」</p>
<p>『Hmmm. For Raydoss, it’s as bad as Klimut......』</p>
<p>As for Jean, we’ve created an undead named Nameless, a necromancer killer. So, for Amanda? No wonder Fran was worried.</p>
<p>However, if I told Klimut about the same thing, he would laugh and say that he was okay.</p>
<p>「Yeah, Amanda-kun is better at protecting her base than attacking... But she’s invincible during this war, so you don’t have to worry about it」</p>
<p>「Are they invincible during a war?」</p>
<p>「I’m not going to be invincible, but Amanda-kun will be fine」</p>
<p>Something, huh? It’s not just mental strength, but she’s physically enhanced. I guess the reason she didn’t go into detail was because it was Amanda’s personal information.</p>
<p>「More importantly, please worry about yourself. You are already a famous adventurer, aren’t you?」</p>
<p>「...? Really?」</p>
<p>She has been active in many places and has won the Ulmutt martial arts tournament. I’ve heard that she’s just starting to call herself the fleet crusher in Barbra. She’s already a full-fledged celebrity!</p>
<p>As a result, they had crushed the conspiracy of the Raidos Kingdom, so it was not surprising that they were eyed. In the future, we would have to be more careful with the surrounding area.</p>
