</div><h1>Chapter 1005</h1><p>Meritte smiled when she saw Fran holding me up. But it was not like she was making a fool of me, but a somewhat melancholy smile.</p>
<p>I could feel their will to fight, but they showed no signs of attacking us.</p>
<p>「Lady from the Black Cat kin. If you’re gonna run away, I won’t chase you, okay?」</p>
<p>「Hmm? He won’t run away」</p>
<p>「After this, this continent will turn into hell. No, I will turn into hell. Now it may still be possible to escape from the continent with my friends, you know?」</p>
<p>「...It’s nothing.」</p>
<p>Fran glared at the other party’s eyes as she shouted at them. She must have understood the resolve she had in her words. Then, Meritte let out a light sigh.</p>
<p>「I see, can I ask you a question?」</p>
<p>「What is it?」</p>
<p>「Why would you want to get your hands on a dragonkin? For black cats, the illegal slavers are your mortal enemies, no? Georg is the Dragon King. In other words, the dragonkin are not your enemy.」</p>
<p>「! So Georg really was the parent orb of an illegal slaver?」</p>
<p>「Exactly. The largest illegal slave trafficker organization with distribution throughout the world. The leader of this organization is the Dragon King Georg.」</p>
<p>Georg had apparently taken over an organization that had existed for a long time by force and let its subordinates run the organization.</p>
<p>Dragonkin tended to avoid slaves, but Georg didn’t show such a feeling. He dared to ignore the common sense of the ordinary dragonkin because he had a strong pride in his fact that he was special.</p>
<p>If I had to put it that way, it would probably mean, “Unlike other dragonkin, I’m a swordsman who use slaves”.</p>
<p>「I had a delusion that I was the new Dragon King approved by the Gods, even though I was just a fake fake! It was really ridiculous!」</p>
<p>「A fake?」</p>
<p>Isn’t the Golden-scaled Dragonkin a symbol of the royal family? What does he mean when he says it’s a fake?</p>
<p>「You’ll see it in the wicked Trismegistus. The magic power of the royal dragonkin is all attributes that have basic attributes. However, evil was not contained in them, but Georg was different. He had both fire and evil attributes. That’s all.」</p>
<p>「But Georg had those golden scales.」</p>
<p>「That’s a fake. Evil Spirits was the power that twisted my mind. I just subconsciously used the Evil Spirits I had innately to show my scales in gold」</p>
<p>This must have been an open secret among the dragonkin elders in the northern settlement. A child of two attributes, which was rare, suddenly got a gold scale.</p>
<p>We know that he was not a royal dragonkin, but the use of this child might make it possible to increase the influence of the northern reservations. The elders thought so, so they picked up Georg and treated him as the Dragon King.</p>
<p>Eventually, Georg assumed that he was the new Dragon King and began to make a blunder.</p>
<p>It’s not just the other dragonkin who had their own ideologies for independence and the slavers under their command. They had truly believed in the Evil God and sacrificed themselves to gain its power.</p>
<p>Georg’s Dragon Control skill was given to him by the Evil Gods. Then, in order to gain even more power, Georg secretly set up evil crystals in each town and was trying to make a large number of sacrifices.</p>
<p>「They didn’t feel sorry for us when they were punished by the gods. A dragonkin is not worth living in. It is for the world’s sake to erase all of their races after all」</p>
<p>「Some dragonkin have good guys versus bad guys.」</p>
<p>「Hmm? But you could say that to your natural enemy, the blue cats?」</p>
<p>「Nn. There are some good blue cats too. It’s not wrong since they are blue cats.」</p>
<p>I guess it was thanks to Zefmate that Fran could say that again.</p>
<p>Fran, who used to consider the entire blue cat race as her enemy when we first met, had many encounters with them. In the Beastman Country and elsewhere, she had also seen a lot of ordinary blue cats.</p>
<p>Because of this, Fran’s values have changed a lot. I don’t know if it could be called growth, but to me, it seemed to be a significant step forward.</p>
<p>「I have some blue cat friends.」</p>
<p>「......Hmph.」</p>
<p>Seeing Fran like that, Meritte sniffed out, seemingly disgusting.</p>
<p>「Dragonkin are a race of scum that is not worthy of existence. A barbaric and low-level lizard that has no choice but to hurt others. Crushers that live by pushing their problems to others. My family is dead because of their neglect!」</p>
<p>Meritte shouted, staring at Fran in a daze. She was excited, calm, and above and below extraordinary tension. Her appearance seemed to be very dangerous.</p>
<p>「Did you know the existence of evil dragonkin?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Many evil dragonkin are killed by their fellow dragonkin, but some are not. They saw an opening, ran away, or were secretly escaped, or have escaped a good number of evil dragonkin from this continent, you know?」</p>

<p>However, there was no way an evil dragonkin would be able to live properly outside the continent. Dragonkin were always evaded by other countries and radiated evil energy.</p>
<p>In the end, many of them ended up being criminals belonging to criminal organizations or bandits.</p>
<p>That’s when he heard that his family was attacked by one of the dragonkin bandits and lost their lives. Both his ancestors and I were plunged into the depths of misfortune by the dragonkin.</p>
<p>To her, a dragonkin was like an absolute evil.</p>
<p>「Dragonkin are something that the world doesn’t need.」</p>
<p>「Not all dragonkin are evil.」</p>
<p>「Little girl...」</p>
<p>From the way she acted at first, she must have felt sympathy for Fran, a black cat.</p>
<p>But Fran and Meritte were different. They realized that and on the contrary, their hatred seemed to have been provoked. I could tell that hostility was beginning to build up in the way they stared at Fran.</p>
<p>But the same went for Fran.</p>
<p>「I now understand that Georg was a bad guy. But when did you start controlling him?」</p>
<p>Indeed, Georg was no good person. He was the leader of the slavers, and worthy of Fran’s hatred.</p>
<p>But was everything Georg did? How could he possibly manipulate more antidemons when he was under his control? I have a hard time thinking about it.</p>
<p>If so, who drew a picture of the most recent event?</p>
<p>Meritte laughed, perhaps sensing the strange question contained in Fran’s gaze.</p>
<p>「Ahahahaha! You see, that was really pathetic! You’re going to die after I took away everything I’ve prepared for the dragonkin’s independence!」</p>
<p>Meritte laughed as she told us. Indeed, it was Georg who had prepared the evil crystals. He had apparently planned to attack the town with dragonkin and mercenaries and slaughter the residents as a sacrifice.</p>
<p>But before we could put that plan into practice, Meritte had taken control of him.</p>
<p>「As you can see, I was the one to finish it off」</p>
<p>「...Is that giant?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, that’s right」</p>
<p>It seems that that giant-type was controlled by Meritte.</p>
<p>「In order to destroy the dragonkin, we must make some sacrifices first!」</p>
<p>As he shouted so, there was a clear hint of madness in his eyes.</p>
