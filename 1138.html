</div><h1>Chapter 1138</h1><p>She continued to block the super fireballs released from the fort for a dozen seconds.</p>
<p>After the heat release had stopped, the situation around us had changed completely.</p>
<p>Smoke and sunlight still rose from the burned plains, and countless blacks that used to be human were lying on top of it. The heat didn’t seem to be enough to make ashes, but the devastation was even more conspicuous when the human form was still alive.</p>
<p>This was exactly what a hell was like.</p>
<p>The adventurers were stunned, completely silent in the face of the devastation.</p>
<p>The army of nobles that had escaped before was annihilated. Everything from top to bottom was burned evenly, without exception.</p>
<p>Nearly 5,000 people lost their lives in a single attack.</p>
<p>On the other hand, about half of the nobles and knights who had started to retreat with the adventurers were still alive. Well, many of them were half-dead from the heatwave. Even if the flames did not directly reach them, their entire bodies were burned from the heat, and their throats were swollen and covered.</p>
<p>「Muh...」</p>
<p>「Donad?」</p>
<p>「I’m trying to expand my range of skills, but it works!」</p>
<p>They tried to use it against the soldiers and knights who had survived the shimmering guardian spirits, but they failed. Although it was dimly lit, it was very weak against the strong light that surrounded the adventurers.</p>
<p>It seemed that the recovery was not very effective. That would only have a little of an effect on prolonging one’s life.</p>
<p>It seems that they weren’t just protecting adventurers, their skills were only effective against adventurers.</p>
<p>Why? No skill would only work on people registered with the Adventurer’s Guild, right?</p>
<p>And some of the knights and soldiers of the nobility army were also shrouded in a white light.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, we were not enveloped in a white light when we first arrived at the battlefield. After that, when we joined up with the adventurers and started fighting, we before we knew it, we had been able to reap the benefits of the guardian’s radiance.</p>
<p>There must be something wrong with him.</p>
<p>『Hmmm......?』</p>
<p>(Master?)</p>
<p>『Donad’s white light. What do you think’s the difference between a guy that works and a guy that doesn’t?』</p>
<p>(Easy.)</p>
<p>『Eh? Fran, you know?』</p>
<p>(Nn. Do you think he’s the boss of Donad?)</p>
<p>『Aah! I see!』</p>
<p>Now that you mention it, they might be. They must be similar to Fran’s “March of the Valkyrie”. Perhaps the key was that Donadrond felt under his command and accepted it as well.</p>
<p>Maybe it was because their inner thoughts were different that they only affected a portion of the knights and soldiers?</p>
<p>However, a slight life-stacking measure was enough for Mareficent. The masked adventurer, who had completed the technique at that time, activated the super-wide recovery magic.</p>
<p>「Wide-Range Maximum Heal!」</p>
<p>A gentle light enveloped the battlefield. Anyone dying on the battlefield was breathing back with a spell that extended Maximum Heal.</p>
<p>She never thought that she could even heal me! She really could do anything, didn’t she? Does she really have any special skills like me that allowed her to collect skills?</p>
<p>She had so many different skills that I wouldn’t have been convinced otherwise.</p>
<p>As I observed Mareficent while healing the soldiers, Avengers and Frederick rushed over to him. Then, they deployed barriers toward the direction of the fort.</p>
<p>「Nuooh!」</p>
<p>「I’m gonna protect the priestess!」</p>
<p>For a moment, I couldn’t understand what they were doing, but soon Fran and I took similar actions.</p>
<p>A flash of red light.</p>
<p>Immediately after we saw the light, two ghouls vaporized their entire barriers. The side of Avenger’s stomach behind them was also gouged into a circle, and a tremendous impact shook our barrier.</p>
<p>It was a sniping from a fort. It was aimed at us with a laser-like flame. It was so fast that we might have been in trouble if Avengers and Frederick hadn’t protected us.</p>
<p>「Attack them from the fort! Let’s get further away!」</p>
<p>「Just like Fran said! Let’s get some more distance!」</p>
<p>That’s really nasty! The Red Knights!</p>
<p>Snipes rained down from the fort to drive away the Kranzel army that was retreating. Although it was weaker than a single shot at Fran, it was enough to kill nobles, knights, and soldiers. Many of them had already lost their lives.</p>
<p>We and Donadrond could try to block our attacks, but we often didn’t make it in time.</p>
<p>Moreover, undead springed up again along the way. The undead looked as if they had been annihilated by the super fire spheres from the fort, but skeletons suddenly appeared and began to attack the Kranzel army.</p>
<p>They were soldiers who had been burned to death by the super fireballs. They had been resurrected by necromancy and turned into skeletons. The tremendous flames had charred their flesh, but their bones must have been still alive.</p>
<p>What was more troublesome was the undead following us in the retreat direction. There were not many of them, but several super powerful headless knights in red armor.</p>
<p>Yes, it was the undead of the red knights, defeated by Forrund.</p>
<p>I only stored Ionez’s corpses, but the red knight’s corpses were still there. They had been resurrected as high-ranking undead, Durahan, and before I knew it, they had been around.</p>
<p>They had been completely intercepted from both the front and the rear. Moreover, the attacks from the fort were continuing.</p>
<p>It might be difficult to retreat at this rate. As the number of undead chased and killed increased, they would turn against us as well. The more time passed, we were at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>That’s why Jean was scared of us on the battlefield.</p>
<p>『It’s gonna be difficult to get rid of the undead completely, you know...?』</p>
<p>(Then we’ll eliminate the source!)</p>
<p>『Hmmm. I guess that’s all it can do.』</p>
