</div><h1>Chapter 1049</h1><p>The multiple Kanna Kamui we unleashed began to deflect the barrier at the top of the water dragonkin. The current Kanna Kamui was powerful enough to be called Extreme Magic. Even if we were able to catch it, it was a powerful barrier. It was much stronger than the water dragonkin we had fought before. The combined effect of the water dragon’s magic power and the magic of its magic tool must have increased the strength of the barrier. But we, who have grown up in Gordicia, will get better! But we, who had grown up in Gordicia, would get through it!  </p>
<p>『Daaaaaahhh!』</p>
<p> The moment I poured more magic power into it, the barrier exploded with a high-pitched sound.  The white lightning landed a direct hit on the water dragonkin and shattered its hull――. </p>
<p>『Huh?』</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p> Didn’t.  For some reason, the water dragonkin was not damaged at all, and a medium-sized ship located behind it was in an explosion. Even if the lightning had reached us through the sea, the way it exploded was strange. In the first place, it was impossible for only one of them to be unscathed.  </p>
<p>『What happened?』</p>
<p>「Just like that」</p>
<p>『Huh?』</p>
<p>「Nn.  Sealing Technique」</p>
<p>『I see!』</p>
<p>  She was right when she said that. It was just like the shield art that we had been through many times, where we swapped our damage with our friends.  But is it possible for ships to do that together?  Or do they even have a magic tool that allows them to do that? Anyway, it has become more and more difficult to target the water dragonkin with precision. </p>
<p>「After many hits, all of them will disappear.」</p>
<p>『Yeah.  The barrier has already been repaired, and it’s impossible to continue the same attack until the fleet disappears. It won’t have any magic power after all』</p>
<p>「Then we just have to get in and defeat them all」</p>
<p>『Hmmm.  I’m afraid I’ll get trapped inside the barrier. It’ll take a while, but I think it’s a good idea to destroy all but the water dragonkin, okay?』</p>
<p>  We’ll sink the other ships that were the personnel in charge of the damage transfer and finally defeat the water dragonkin. It would also reduce the number of people who needed to take over the town, and it may sound like a long way around, but it was the most reliable way to fight.  </p>
<p>「Then we’ll crush the other ships!」</p>
<p>『Ou!』</p>
<p>「Grrrr!」</p>
<p>  We split up into two groups and began our attack on the enemy fleet. By purposely exposing ourselves, we would attract the attention of our enemies and destroy each ship individually.  At first, it worked. Urushi showed off his huge body and occasionally shrunk to attack ships from under the sea, and Fran flew around the sky to shoot lightning.  The enemy fleet was in complete chaos. Although it was a small ship, we succeeded in sinking several of them. However, anomaly soon came.  To our surprise, more than just the water dragonkin, they had more wards in place. Rather than constantly covering the entire sea, they seemed to have deployed thick wards only in that area in response to our attack. Moreover, even if the attack was successful, the same phenomenon as that shield art would be triggered and the damage would be transferred to the smaller ship.  They must have been taking various measures to protect the main ships. They were obviously planning to deal with someone strong enough to destroy the fleet by themselves.  In other words, why was they so well prepared in terms of defense?  </p>
<p>「Hmm?  People?」</p>
<p>『Suddenly!』</p>
<p> Suddenly, something jumped up from the deck of the Water Dragon ship. And without any killing intent or fighting spirit, they released an ice bullet at us. If she hadn’t experienced a similar battle at Trismegistus, she might have gotten hit too.  </p>
<p>「Girl...?  That neck!」</p>
<p>『I see, she’s being enslaved』</p>
<p> The girl who showed up was a beautiful girl about the same age as Fran, clad in black hair, blond eyes, and reddish-copper skin.  She didn’t seem to be flying, but she had created an ice plate in the air and used it as a foothold. She seemed to be using wind magic to help her jump.  She approached Fran while wearing a black cloak like a trench coat.  Was it a horn that grew out of her temples? I wondered if it was a demon, but there was something strange about the way it grew... The horned girl shot magic at Fran, but for some reason, she didn’t seem to have the will or anything to kill her.  </p>
<p>『It looks like she has been taken away from her.』</p>
<p>「Nn......!」</p>
<p>  Fran stared at the girl’s neck with an expression of hatred. A dull metallic ring was attached to the girl’s neck as if she was strangling.  It was the slave’s collar.  Moreover, it seemed that she was somehow deprived of her will and acted like a puppet. The girl unleashed ice and snow magic without any further talk without doing anything to us.The girl unleashed her ice and snow magic without any further talk without doing anything to us.Unique SkillsWater Dragon Bond, Icy Snow Demon Innate Skills Ship Protection, Striker TitlesSahagginslayer Equipment Windfrost Saber, Water Dragon Scale Leather Armor, Cloak of adaptation, Water Dragon Leather Gloves, Water Dragon’s shoes, commander’s hat, heavy snow ring, and ice bracelet were quite strong.  Their level and status were not matching.  They were obviously not strong enough to match their level.  Their magic relations were remarkable, but their strength was quite high as well. They were in a puppet state, and they seemed to be deprived of their free will.  Besides, I’m also curious about their name.  Seedrun?  So, he’s related to the Seedran Sea Country, huh?  In normal circumstances, he’s probably like a princess. Their skill should have a water dragon bond.  Since they were controlling it, they might be doing something to the Raidos Kingdom. Since they’ve been targeting the royalty of Philias, there was no way that that country would respect the royalty of another country. However, what attracted the most attention was the race.  </p>
<p>『Magic demon...  If it’s a magician, this might be Zelyse’s research』</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>  The research was supposed to implant magic stones in people to create superhumans.  But what was a magic demon? Did she implant a magic stone into a girl who was originally a demon?  But who seemed to be the girl’s big brother, Suarez, was a human, right?  Besides, how he grew that uncomfortable being.  Could it be that he combined a magic stone with a demon’s horn into a human body? Is that the secret to Mar’s strength? Moreover, it seemed that by making him a puppet, he was able to control the magicians who lost their mind and went out of control.  </p>
<p>「――Ice Barrett」</p>
<p>「!  Hey!」</p>
<p>『It’s no use, Fran. She’s being enslaved and a magician too.』</p>
<p>「But......!」</p>
<p>  Fran avoided the ice and snow magic that was unleashed, but did not make a counterattack. She hesitated to attack the girl.  </p>
<p>「freeze shot」</p>
<p>『Fran!  Attack her!』</p>
<p>「No!  Because!」</p>
<p> It seemed that just looking at the silver collar that appealed to her vision made her overlap with her former self.  It was not just that she was being controlled, but she was wearing a slave collar. Moreover, she was a girl her age.  It may be more difficult to not overlap her, but...At this rate, they would just be one-sidedly attacked.</p>
