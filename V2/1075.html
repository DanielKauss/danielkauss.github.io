</div><h1>Chapter 1075</h1><p>Fran stared at Fran, who seemed to be asleep, but she must have noticed what was going on around her right away. About 70% of the villagers had escaped from the square, but the old men and injured still remain unable to escape. They seemed to be surprised by the sudden situation. I appraised the villagers just in case, but they were all ordinary villagers. Fran started to move with a look of fatigue on her face. </p>
<p>『Fran. Are you okay? If you don’t want to move, you can sit down, okay? The villagers will do something about it with my body double.』</p>
<p> The villagers will do something about it with my body double.』</p>
<p>「... I’m fine.」</p>
<p>『... I see.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>  Fran broke the restraints on the villagers’ hands and feet and used recovery magic to heal their wounds.  The villagers thank her, but she couldn’t seem to be happy.  Their eyes were not so calm on Fran, who was asleep.  Well, that’s not surprising. Because Fran was on the lookout for them, no one attempted to take action. The villagers still in the plaza knew that Fran and Fran were acquaintances.  However, the villagers came back, probably understanding that the commotion in the plaza had subsided.  Some of them didn’t even know what was going on and tried to run as soon as they saw Fran. But Fran stood in front of them.  </p>
<p>「W-What the hell?」</p>
<p>「...... I’ve caught them, so my prey.  Don’t do anything rash.」</p>
<p>「W-What the hell are you――」</p>
<p>「Stop!  What are you doing to your debtors!?」</p>
<p>「That’s right! You’re begging for your life first, but you’re still amazing at being a child!」</p>
<p>  It was also the villagers who stopped those people. Some were really grateful to them, others thought that they couldn’t afford to offend Fran when they saw her fighting.  Also, the village chief’s voice, “You should think about the future first!” had restrained the chaos for the time being.  It seemed that it was also thanks to the fact that there were no deaths among the villagers. As Fran recovered from the villagers, they realized that this girl was no enemy.  The first aid work was over, and the villagers were starting to calm down.  After confirming this, I instructed Fran to follow. Fran called over the village chief and suggested that she should escape from this village.  This village, which had been noticed by both Raydoss and Philias, was in a very dangerous state. It was terrible for the villagers who had just been released, but they should have evacuated to the town.  There were still people who wanted to stay in the village, but in the end, they all agreed to move. The fact that the damage had actually occurred was different from the fishing village we stopped in the way from Barbra, and the amount of persuasion that the family could get was different.  A group of Metermam managed to leave the day after Fran stowed the food in the village’s warehouses. The journey was very slow, but there were only a few magic beasts in this area, so they managed to manage it.  We traveled for a few hours, maybe about half of the way down the mountain road.  We caught a certain presence that we observed from a distance. We left it for a while, but it kept coming back. </p>
<p>『It might be better to take care of this first.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>  Fran told him to take a short break in an open area and covered the surroundings with a wall of earth magic, before leaving alone. Anyways, since she was carrying Fran with her, were they two?  Since they were not too far away, we could find out if anything was going on with the villagers.  I knew Fran was coming, but the owner of that presence did not try to escape. Then, Fran landed in front of them. </p>
<p>「I knew it, Satia...」</p>
<p>「Fran-san...」</p>
<p>  Satia was the one who monitored them.  With a complicated look on her face as if she was crying, she didn’t seem to have any hostility. However, I could feel a strong sadness from her.  </p>
<p>「Are your wounds okay?」</p>
<p>「Yeah.  I somehow made it out of there」</p>
<p>  The wound on Ronowe’s wound remained, but the wound seemed to have been somehow blocked. Fran and Satia smiled awkwardly.  </p>
<p>「You’re the one...」</p>
<p>「...Are you sure?」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>  Fran handed Fran over Fran to Satia.  I think it was better to give it to the government or the guild, but that would probably bother Fran...  Since it was not possible to hold back all the villagers, it could be exposed to the government. What should we do then?  Satia, who had received the unconscious Frut, tilted her head in confusion.  </p>
<p>「Go out. A life demon.」</p>
<p>「......Here.」</p>
<p>「Inspect your big brother’s condition.」</p>
<p>「Haah.」</p>
<p>  What appeared from Satia’s shadow were demons like bats attached to a chimpanzee.  The demon looked at us with a terrified look for a moment. Could it be the effect of killing monsters?  But in just a moment, she quickly put her hand on Fran and began to send magic power to her.  She was using a combination of recovery magic and life magic. I could see that Fran’s condition had been slightly improved.  At the same time, she seemed to have been scrutinizing inside of Fran. In a crouching, old voice, she reported Fran’s condition to Satia.  </p>
<p>「I can’t sense any power coming from you.」</p>
<p>「What do you mean......?  You’re saying it hasn’t disappeared, right?」</p>
<p>「Just in time. If we just leave you like this, you’ll disappear soon.」</p>
<p> Our recovery magic was able to heal Fran, but it probably wasn’t enough to reach the demon bune.  </p>
<p>「I’m sorry......  I couldn’t protect Fran.」</p>
<p>  Fran then explained the story of what had happened. I had absorbed the knife that killed the demons, and I was worried that she would believe that it was the work of Raydoss’s operative...  </p>
<p>「... I believe in it. I did the same knife the other day」</p>
<p>  It seemed to be a trump card that the Kingdom of Raydoss had prepared for Philias. Last month, last month and last month, two demon knights lost their lives.  However, Satia told us that both of them had been retrieved by the Philias royal family.  A few more knives from the failed divine sword......? But unless they’ve found them somewhere, does the Raidos Kingdom have the ability to mass-produce failed divine swords? </p>
<p>「It’s said to be originally a magic sword passed down through my royal family.」</p>
<p>「Did Filurias have a sword to kill demons?」</p>
<p>「Yes.  I’ve heard that it was a trump card to deal with the Great Demon sealed in the divine sword when it ran amok. But it was stolen from the treasury many years ago...」</p>
<p>  In other words, there was a magic sword that paired with the Demon Lord’s Sword, Diabolos, and it contained the power to kill demons. But was it stolen by Raidos and analyzed?  I don’t know the specifics, but I’m sure the Kingdom of Raidos had succeeded in imitating the power of the magic sword. With the know-how of the Pseudo Fanatic Sword and the magic sword to kill demons, wouldn’t it be impossible? Satia hugged Fran tightly and began to cry.  </p>
<p>「During my manifestation, the connection between the magician and the demon is strong.  It seems that they are aiming for that...」</p>
<p>  Even if the demon is just summoned or possessed, killing them would not be a fatal wound. Even if the demon is lost, the damage to the caster is reduced. However, since they were all the same during manifestation, the curse of killing demons would even kill the magician.  </p>
<p>「It is a miracle that you saved us this time.  Fran-san, thank you」</p>
<p>  Satia said thanks, but Fran remained with a complicated expression on her face.  Perhaps it was because she regretted that she had more work to do. She told her about the magic stones so that she could cover it up.  </p>
<p>「... I’ve destroyed the magic stones in the village」</p>
<p>「So it was Fran-san, huh? The curse has stopped flowing, so I thought it might have been possible」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>「Thank you very much.」</p>
<p>「... Why?」</p>
<p>「Because you have saved our country.」</p>
<p>「But......!  I...!  Both Fran and Satia tried to cut them!」</p>
<p>「It’s us and the Raidos Kingdom that’s wrong.  You’re not doing anything wrong. </p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p> There was no lie in Satia’s words.  She was concerned for Fran, even though her brother was badly injured and she had been cut. Fran looked even more distressed because she could understand that. </p>
<p>「Even your big brother will be sad if he is bothered by you」</p>
<p>「... I’m sorry」</p>
<p>「... Both you and I are grateful.  We were trying to take innocent people in our hands, even if it was for our country’s sake. You stopped us from doing so.」</p>
<p>  I think Fran and Urushi were unconsciously holding back. If they had really been cold-heartedly trying to kill the villagers, they would have had the opportunity to kill them even if we had protected them.  The fact that they did not do so probably meant that deep down they were hesitant to kill the villagers. Maybe the first time they raised the bandits to the blood festival was necessary to be prepared to kill them.  </p>
<p>「I have saved the people of the village, the people of our country, and your big brother.  I can assure you that. So don’t cry?」</p>
<p>「... Nn」</p>
<p>  The two girls, who were feeling guilt for each other, hugged each other with tears in their eyes.Since she didn’t do that, she must have been hesitant to kill the villagers deep down in her mind. Perhaps the first time she raised the bandits to the blood festival was to prepare her for death. </p>
<p>「You saved the people of the village, the people of our country, and your big brother. I can assure you that. So don’t cry?」</p>
<p>「...Nn」</p>
<p> The two girls, who were feeling guilt for each other, hugged each other with tears in their eyes. Both of them could only watch over them quietly.</p>
