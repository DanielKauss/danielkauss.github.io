</div><h1>Chapter 957</h1><p>We captured the dragonkin and asked them about a lot of things, but we didn’t get much important information from them. In fact, we didn’t get any good information from them, we just moved as ordered.</p>
<p>Still, I did understand a few things.</p>
<p>「So, it’s the Dragon King’s order?」</p>
<p>「Nn. The northern dragonkin are my enemy.」</p>
<p>「It looks like the entire settlement is cooperating with the Dragon King.」</p>
<p>The dragonkin we caught were no ordinary thugs.</p>
<p>They were apprentice warriors in the northern dragonkin settlements. They were not those fledgling after disapproving of strict training, but they were officially ordered to cooperate with the Dragon King.</p>
<p>「But you don’t know what he’s doing」</p>
<p>「They don’t even know where he is right now」</p>
<p>But I didn’t know much more. Well, it was enough just to know that the Dragon King was making a move in the dark.</p>
<p>「If their testimonies are true, it means that the Dragon King is trying to block this area. I don’t know what they’re trying to do, but I’m sure it won’t be a good deal」</p>
<p>「My witness, it wasn’t a lie」</p>
<p>「Huh? Could it be, you have lie detection?」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Hahaha! That’s what I’m counting on!」</p>
<p>「What should we do?」</p>
<p>「That’s right. I’d like to hear from a dragonkin who knows a little more about his situation. Come to think of it, that threat from earlier was good, isn’t it? I’ll leave it to you next time too」</p>
<p>「Nn! I’ll leave it to you」</p>
<p>There were three main pieces of information coming from the dragonkin.</p>
<p>The Dragon King ordered the dragonkin of the northern reservations to eliminate intruders. He also said that the Dragon King was trying to gain powerful power and become a transcendent being. He also said that he was using his power to make this continent a dragonkin and was trying to create a new Dragon King.</p>
<p>「I don’t know how Trismegistus is related to the Dragon King’s goal, but I’m sure it’ll be good.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Let’s go」</p>
<p>「Hmm, what should we do next? Miss Hilt, did you have permission to enter the center of the country?」</p>
<p>「It’s an emergency」</p>
<p>「Hmm... Well, maybe I should go all out after an S-Ranked adventurer gives them permission. They’re usually cooperating with the guild, so they don’t use their powers at times like this.」</p>
<p>「Oh! So, can I go see Trismegistus then?」</p>
<p>「Finding the Dragon King is our top priority, you know?」</p>
<p>「Understood」</p>
<p>Somehow, we ended up breaking into the center of the continent without permission. We should have needed permission from the guild anyways...... But would it be okay if Isario was with us and he would accompany us later?</p>
<p>Besides, as Isario said, our top priority is to deal with the Dragon King. If left unchecked, that’s how much progress we can make.</p>
<p>Oh, and the dragonkin left them there.</p>
<p>Even though he was an enemy, Isario made a promise that he would not take his life. Besides, he was not involved in the illegal slave trade.</p>
<p>They looked like dragonkin, even if they were weak. They would escape on their own one day.</p>
<p>The Dragon King must have made a determination to find and capture him before he could achieve his goal, but he soon stopped.</p>
<p>Crack......</p>
<p>「Did you shake it?」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>Isario paused and muttered immediately after making a sound like a echo. It seems the ground felt trembling, but Fran and I didn’t notice it.</p>
<p>It was Urushi’s superiority after all. The only thing that could be passed down to them was the tremors when Urushi ran.</p>
<p>『Urushi, how is it?』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Urushi nodded huh. It seems he really was shaken.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The earth shook louder than before!</p>
<p>「I was trembling!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Did you feel it too, young miss!? What in the world just happened......? I’ve never heard of the earth shook Gordicia before.」</p>
<p>Apparently, Gordicia was a continent where no earthquake itself occurred. That meant that there was no doubt that some kind of unusual situation was occurring.</p>
<p>And right after that.</p>
<p>「What?」</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>「Grrr!」</p>
<p>Fran and Urushi braced themselves at the same time. An obviously extraordinary amount of Evil Spirit suddenly covered the entire area.</p>
<p>At the same time, the ground began to tremble violently.</p>
<p>Rattle――Gwoogh!</p>
<p>A tremendous tremor shook the earth, even allowing Fran and Urushi’s bodies to lightly move upwards. Isn’t that about a magnitude of 5?</p>
<p>The shaking did not stop there, but it only increased in intensity.</p>
<p>「Something’s coming out!」</p>
<p>「That should be in the direction of the Trismegistus castle!」</p>
<p>Suddenly, something huge appeared in the direction Fran pointed out. The shape of the sore that appeared after breaking through the earth was hard to tell because of the dust flying up.</p>
<p>However, behind the veil of dust that covered the air, there was clearly a huge shadow that looked to be several dozen meters long.</p>
<p>No, if it looked so big even from this distance, it might have exceeded 100 meters.</p>
<p>In terms of size, it was a super huge high-rise building.</p>
<p>「Hey young miss, wait here. I don’t even know what’s going on.」</p>
<p>「...Okay. Trismegistus, are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Haha! This is the first time I’ve ever seen anyone worried about their safety. Besides, they are immortal. If there is anyone who can kill them, I’d love to know about it」</p>
<p>I don’t even know who did what in the first place. Maybe the Dragon King’s dark moves, or maybe Trismegistus did something to him? Or maybe there was something wrong with the antidemons themselves?</p>
<p>Now that we had less information, we had no choice but to wait here.</p>
<p>We waited for a few minutes, looking nervous.</p>
<p>A faint silhouette appeared on the other side of the dust.</p>
<p>「I can see a little of it!」</p>
<p>「Arf!」</p>
<p>「What the hell is this......?」</p>
<p>At first I thought it was a tower or something, but it wasn’t a structure.</p>
<p>Shadows began to wriggle. Sole was clearly alive after a series of peristalsis.</p>
