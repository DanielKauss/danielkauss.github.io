</div><h1>Chapter 1107</h1><p>「Hahaha, like pigs dominating people, you know? Come on, don’t you think?」</p>
<p> The Chief Soldier blurted out his dissatisfaction with the country. There was no doubt that brainwashing education was being conducted in the Raidos Kingdom, but not all of them were obedient to it. </p>
<p>「Besides, there were a few people who have been on a rampage in our country lately」</p>
<p>「Are they on a rampage?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. They attacked nobleman’s mansions to steal their food and scattered it around the poor town. To be honest, they’re bothering me, but when I talk to them, I find that they’re interesting... I guess they came from the Kranzel Kingdom」</p>
<p> It seems that they came from the Kranzel Kingdom」</p>
<p>「What kind of people are they?」</p>
<p>「They call them a mercenary group consisting entirely of half-insectkin. And I also heard that there’s a strong adventurer old man with them」</p>
<p> Oi, that’s...  </p>
<p>(Neidhart and the others?)</p>
<p>『Probably.』</p>
<p> Apparently, Neidhart and Dimitris are both doing whatever they want in the Raidos Kingdom.  When we asked them for more details, they were reckless.  They said they would attack greedy nobles and their men, but their methods were quite formidable. They attacked the mansions head-on to knock all the guards out, and even attacked the troops in the training to steal supplies. He was also involved in a slave release movement and even took extreme actions to kill nobles to free them.He was also involved in a movement to liberate slaves, and was said to even take extreme action to kill nobles to free them.  I bet he was trying to kill registered owners who didn’t give up their ownership in order to free their former slavers.  Neidhart and the others were prepared to betray the Kingdom of Kranzel to save the captured and old friends.I bet Neidhart and the others were prepared to betray the Kingdom of Kranzel in order to save the captured comrades.  They would not hesitate to use force.  They would only do that if they replaced Fran with her, and if they wanted to save the black cats enslaved.  Dimitris was giving alms in the middle of the city, so I don’t really get what he’s supposed to do. That old man would come up with anything out of his head. However, Neidhart and Dimitris rarely took the lives of those who were seriously working for them, and this commander had fought them about two times before.  </p>
<p>「Both were killed instantly. Or did you just pass out so quickly that they didn’t kill you?」</p>
<p>  The mantis man was knocked unconscious and escaped. He’s Neidhart, by any stretch of the imagination.  Since the old man was at the front of the Food Stealth, it seems Dimitris was leading the way. They may be separating their forces, with Dimitris punishing the undead and Neidhart protecting the slaves.  They also tried to get information about the Southern Duke from the captives, but they didn’t have that much detailed information. They were really just being treated as abandoned pieces.  I call it a matter of internal affairs, but they only knew about the lives of the people. They also didn’t know about the undead that attacked Alessa.  However, undead were used in various scenes in the recent Southern Duke’s mansions, and there were many necromancers. Not many people are able to summon more than thousands of undead, but there are still people who could think of two of them.  </p>
<p>「One is from a unit that uses an undead called the Black Skeleton. In particular, I’ve heard that the magician named Nameless, the first seat of the group, is quite skilled」</p>
<p>  It seems that even in the country of Raidos, the Black Skeleton Corps was not well known to be a unit made up entirely of necromancy. It seems that Nameless was also thought to be a person who uses necromancy.  </p>
<p>「The other one?」</p>
<p>「I haven’t heard about him lately, but he was very famous as a magician called Woofslot. Not only is he a rare necromancer, but his name will naturally spread if he’s a very skilled one」</p>
<p>「What about him now?」</p>
<p>「I don’t know.  He’s suddenly gone out of sight since last year... However, there’s been a lot of rumors about him, such as being killed by a revenger or being hired by a country to do the dirty work」</p>
<p>「Black rumors?」</p>
<p>「 Rumors have it that he was killing people to increase the number of undead’s subordinates, and rumors that he was a admirer of the Evil God. Aah, there were also rumors that the monster actually wore the skin of a person」</p>
<p> The main idea was that they were people who were being told that their behavior was too bad.  </p>
<p>『For now, let’s escort these guys to Alessa』</p>
<p>「Nn.  Oi, I’ll bring you to the town now. If you don’t like to hurt, don’t go against it」</p>
<p>  Fran! Then we’ll be the ones to take care of it!  After that, we’ll retrieve the scouts and bind the land magicians up.  I’ve connected the limbs I’ve cut properly, you know?  I transported them to Alessa at once with Urushi’s maximized back.  I heard a scream, but Fran ignored them. I guess her hostility towards Raydoss could not be extinguished by the mere mention of her inner feelings. Even so, she was careful not to fall down, so perhaps her hostility towards these soldiers had faded.  I thought about it along the way.  But where did that undead army surrounding Alessa come from?  I don’t think many necromancers have called them together. It was a struggle to break through the border after all.  So, did a high-ranking magician do it alone?  That was also strange.  Even though it was a horde, it was not powerful enough to knock down the town. Or rather, it was a pointless offensive. I wondered if they had any plans to return the border forces to the Kranzel Kingdom as much as possible, but I think they were not enough for that.  They didn’t seem to be working with the magicians we had captured this time, and it was really meaningless.  As I was wondering about this, Alessa came into view. There was no sign of the undead springing up again, so I wondered if they had regained some of their calmness.  It was just right after I thought that.  Boom of light rose from the center of the noble district of Alessa with a tremendous crash.I wondered if they had any plans to return the forces of the border to the Kranzel Kingdom as much as possible, but I think that was not enough.
