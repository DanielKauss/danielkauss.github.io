</div><h1>Chapter 918</h1><p>「Saintess-sama, let’s go together! You know your friends are doing their best, right? Let’s help them!」</p>
<p>「Yes... Yes!」</p>
<p>It seems this city wasn’t something we just abandoned yet. Along with the people who had gathered, we ran off.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just the warmth of Urushi standing next to her. I could feel the many breaths on her back that assured her.</p>
<p>Now I have no more feelings of remorse or despair.</p>
<p>Many people, who should have had no way of fighting, stood up for Sendia and Fran.</p>
<p>When I thought about it, I was about to cry differently than before.</p>
<p>When we looked back, I saw everyone’s expressions of determination. They knew that they might die. Still, they were about to fight.</p>
<p>I won’t let them do anything rash just by myself. I’ll be prepared too. I’ll give it everything I have. I’ll use all I can to do anything.</p>
<p>Immediately after she decided that. The magic string Lauda, which she had been sitting on her back, trembled. It was as if it was carrying life.</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but pick up Lauda and――</p>
<p>「Ah――」</p>
<p>I remembered.</p>
<p>I wonder why I had forgotten that. A painful, painful memory of that day. No, that was why I had forgotten it? Or was it because this girl had made me forget about it?</p>
<p>But then I remembered... the power of mine that killed my foster father. And the true power of the magic string Lauda that was in my hand.</p>
<p>「Urushi, let’s run!」</p>
<p>「Woof?」</p>
<p>「Don’t worry, I won’t leave everyone behind」</p>
<p>Maybe it was because she remembered Lauda’s true power? The sound emanating from the strings that she played lightly was more clear than ever. This sound could be supplemented with stronger power than ever before.</p>
<p>Naturally, my fingers played the song. I could tell that the magic song had empowered the people behind me.</p>
<p>「S-Saintess-sama? This is......?」</p>
<p>「Let’s run! Now we can run!」</p>
<p>I jumped on Urushi’s back. Then Urushi took my will and ran powerfully. Naturally, no normal person would be able to keep up with the speed of his legs.</p>
<p>But now everyone was being strengthened by me. His legs, which had run out like Urushi’s, created a speed far faster than they had imagined.</p>
<p>As we looked back from Urushi’s back, I saw that they were all following him closely.</p>
<p>At that moment, I spotted more antidemons rushing in from the front. Like I thought, not even Fran and the others could have completely blocked it. There were probably not many of them yet, but I’m sure more antidemons were going in.</p>
<p>But it was okay.</p>
<p>「Grrr! Woof!」</p>
<p>Urushi’s magic shattered the antidemons, but it wasn’t just Urushi either.</p>
<p>「Looks slow, aren’t you!?」</p>
<p>「It looks weak!」</p>
<p>「Yeah!」</p>
<p>Using their spears and pans, Announcer-san and Katley struck down an antidemon. With just one blow, they could defeat it. No matter how low-ranked antidemons were, this was not something normal.</p>
<p>「Thank you, Saintess-sama?」</p>
<p>「Thanks to all your courage! I’m just helping you with that!」</p>
<p>「Saintess-sama! That’s amazing!」</p>
<p>「This way, we can fight!」</p>
<p>They were surprised at first, but soon their expressions changed to serious.</p>
<p>Now that they had the strength, they must have understood once again that they were on their way to the battlefield. However, no one escaped. I wonder how reliable their friends were.</p>
<p>Their resolve and thoughts were conveyed to me.</p>
<p>「Urushi, something a little surprising might happen, but don’t stop you, okay?」</p>
<p>「Woof? Woof woof!」</p>
<p>「Ufufu, Thank you.」</p>
<p>I patted Urushi’s neck, which barked enthusiastically, and I uttered those words.</p>
<p>「Lauda, lend me your strength again」</p>
<p>As soon as she put her finger on the harp, a loud vibration echoed through the air.</p>
<p>Right now, I can use this kid’s power properly. It was different from that time. That’s why I’m okay. I take a big breath, then shout.</p>
<p>「Sing holy verses and an oratorio! Divine Sword Release!」</p>
<p>At my words, “Divine Sword Release”, Lauda emitted a strong light. Lauda changed his shape, shining brightly in her hand, as if she was made of brick or something.</p>
<p>「W-woof!?」</p>
<p>「That’s right. This is the true form of the magic string Lauda. Oratrio, the saintess sword. A divine sword.」</p>
<p>The first time I released this power was the day I killed my foster father. With anger and curses, I used Lauda’s power. And that was the first and last moment I heard the sound of the Oratorio.</p>
<p>Anger and guilt. Fear and regret. Various negative emotions have eaten my heart and robbed me of my painful memories.</p>
<p>I’ve been able to sense the emotions of others since I was a child. I didn’t think I was strange, but to a human being, this was a rare ability.</p>
<p>Her foster father said that she had a good sense of sympathy for him. It was an amazing ability for everyone to enjoy the sound. I thought so, but that was not all.</p>
<p>That day when I used Lauda, a gift from my foster father, to curse my foster father. The village people’s hatred and the mad laughter of my foster father echoed through my face.</p>
<p>I took on the negative emotions of other people, and was overwhelmed by those dark feelings.</p>
<p>Then I sealed away the memory of the Divine Sword and a part of my emotions. No, I guess Oratrio was the one who sealed me away to protect me. I can see it now.</p>
<p>If my memories had remained, I would have been broken by my fear of power, my feelings of guilt, and regret. For me at that time, the Oracle was a symbol of doom and despair.</p>
<p>But the timbre of the oratorium must not just be filled with despair. I was convinced that this instrument, named after the Divine Sword, could play a song of hope that made many people happy.</p>
<p>As if to respond, Oratrio would tell me what he really wanted to use.</p>
<p>I screeched the silver harp in my hand, which I even took in my hand. Then, several instruments appeared around me.</p>
<p>I had drums, organs, violins, casters, and all the other instruments I could play.</p>
<p>They were lined up in a semicircle that surrounded me, as if they were all one instrument.</p>
<p>All of them were part of the oratorium. I wanted them to ring like this. Just as I wished, the instrument would make a perfect timbre.</p>
<p>This made it possible for him to play complex songs by himself. The ultimate instrument for magic song users. The Saintess Sword, Oratrio.</p>
<p>「Guys! Everyone, lend me your strength!」</p>
<p>「E-excuse me for lending me my strength?」</p>
<p>Even though she was bewildered to see Oracle, she immediately reacted to my words. Everyone was listening to my voice.</p>
<p>Then I told them the truth.</p>
<p>「Let’s sing!」</p>
<p>「Eh? No, now?」</p>
<p>She looked puzzled after all. I guess it was only natural. But that was exactly what would help us save Fran and Urushi.</p>
<p>「Yes! I’m fine, it’s a song that everyone knows about!」</p>
<p>「U-understood! That’s what Saintess-sama said! I believe!」</p>
<p>「Thank you very much」</p>
<p>After hearing this, they all seemed to agree. She straightened up to sing.</p>
<p>I was playing a song that everyone in this city had sung before, a song similar to a lullaby.</p>
<p>「True of Creation...... Performance, “An Adventurer’s Song”.」</p>
<p>I draw a score to give the form of the thoughts and power contained in this song. I’ve been feeling this excited ever since.</p>
<p>「Well then, let’s go」</p>
<p>I let out a light breath, then I spun out my hope.</p>
<p>「I risk my life to come here~♪ It’s the dangerous golden continent~♪ The big kidnappers! A dream adventure♪」</p>
<p>「Ah, this song...」</p>
<p>「Now I can sing!」</p>
<p>「But why is this song?」</p>
<p>He seemed to immediately understand what song I was singing. But he seemed to be confused in a different way.</p>
<p>Indeed, it might not be a song to be sung on the battlefield. The tone of the song was cheerful and befitting of a bar, and the lyrics were quite bad.</p>
<p>But this was an adventure and bond song that had been sung for many years. This was the only song I could think of.</p>
<p>I looked back as I sang, staring at everyone with the thought of 「Come on!」. But I guess that feeling was clear to me.</p>
<p>She started singing along with us. A little at first. But little by little, the number of people singing, the number of sounds, and the feeling of being able to add them to the lyrics increased.</p>
<p>「We are adventurers~...♪ The golden adventurers~...♪」</p>
<p>「No foe shall make us falter!」</p>
<p>「Dragons, demons, bring anything on!」</p>
<p>「The horde of antidemons is a piece of cake!」</p>
<p>「For booze, for friends, for gold! The adventurers fight on!」</p>
<p>「Don’t lose...♪ Keep going...♪ Show them your pride...♪」</p>
<p>「Stand up! Come on, this is our chance to show them what we’ve got!」</p>
<p>「Show them what you got!」</p>
<p>「We’re with you!」</p>
<p>「We are adventurers~...♪」</p>
<p>「「「The golden adventurers~...♪」」」</p>
<p>I bundled people’s thoughts and applied them to the sound of the oratorio.</p>
<p>I could feel the song becoming a power and spreading throughout the city. Now we could send sound out to the entire city.</p>
<p>I, that rare thing.</p>
<p>We prayed for Fran and the others’ safety, victory in the battle against antidemons, and the weaving of this song by Oratrio and the people.</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>I see it! Fran and Urushi! They’re still fighting!</p>
<p>I was yelling at them. To teach them that we too were there.</p>
<p>「Fran! I’ve brought in more reinforcements!」</p>
