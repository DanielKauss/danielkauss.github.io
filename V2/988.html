</div><h1>Chapter 988</h1><p>Fran looked at the hydrangea for a while after she saw them off. And when the atmosphere of the place finally began to move, she wiped the tears from the corners of her eyes and looked down at them. Beyond her gaze was Berserk, who was put in a scabbard and placed next to the hydrangea. It seemed like Berserk had lost his power and must have been wondering about it. The jet-black sheath made it hard to believe that he had been radiating that strong pure white magic power. The Berserk that was placed inside it was also quiet as if he had fallen asleep with the user. The Berserk that was placed inside it was also quiet as if he had fallen asleep with the user.  The hydrangea must have noticed Fran’s gaze.  She then lightly touched her sheath.  </p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>  They stared at each other for a while. However, Fran had never touched Berserk or his sheath at all. She looked at you and asked about the future moves of the Kingdom of Hagane.  </p>
<p>「What are you gonna do now, you guys?」</p>
<p>「We’ve performed our duty.  Our forces are not ready yet, and we will be left behind for more. We’ll turn back here」</p>
<p>「Yes」</p>
<p>  Fran nodded her head. I didn’t think it was my imagination that she seemed to be looking a little relieved. She must be afraid that she might end up using Berserk even for the hydrangea.  Fran’s eyes turned to Berserk again. However, she immediately removed her gaze.  They were curious to see how Fran was like.  The hydrangea was looking up at us.  </p>
<p>「Black Lightning Princess」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>「Why don’t you ask me?」</p>
<p>「... You don’t have to ask」</p>
<p>「Why?  Normally, they’d ask me」</p>
<p>  A strange conversation between the hydrangea and Fran. It was a quiet conversation without a subject.  </p>
<p>「I don’t know」</p>
<p>「Yes. </p>
<p>「Thank you」</p>
<p>「I don’t really mind」</p>
<p>  The pace and the content of the conversation were strange. To be honest, we didn’t know if the conversation was established or not, and neither did we, who were listening to it, could understand the meaning of the conversation. Even so, Fran and the Hydrangea were clearly communicating.  I wondered why this was the case.  Maybe we could understand each other with a different sensitivities? But I also understand a part of it, right? Fran decided not to ask him about the scabbard.  Well, it was a national secret, so I guess he wouldn’t tell me.  If that was the case, it might be safer to not talk about it than to give him a bad impression.  Fran probably didn’t think so much about it. She didn’t seem to know why she didn’t ask that question herself either. Perhaps it was a combination of her feelings of mourning for the Masteer and her consideration for the Hydrangea. In the meantime, Isario and the others came back to us with an emissary.  He must have immediately understood the situation.  He then pomponed Fran’s head and bowed his head to the corpse of the song. </p>
<p>「Thank you very much, young miss of the song, huh?」</p>
<p>  The same went for the adventurers behind him. They must have heard from Isario.  </p>
<p>「Shiki-san, hasn’t that been enough for you to handle this?」</p>
<p>「... Well, you’re right.  I’d like to do that. Please take a short break and let me know」</p>
<p>「Understood」</p>
<p>「The hydrangea, please get back to the wagon.  I’ll take care of you」</p>
<p>「Understood. </p>
<p>「The hydrangea, please go back to the carriage.  I’ll ask them to take care of you」</p>
<p>「Okay, Fran, that’s bad」</p>
<p>「Nn, that’s bad」</p>
<p> Fran continued to wave her hand until the hydrangea who had turned away and the stubble that she held disappeared into the carriage. Behind her, Isario was discussing with her.  </p>
<p>「Will you be able to return from here to the town on your own?」</p>
<p>「Of course」</p>
<p>  She nodded immediately at Isario’s words. We were already in a state of half-destruction, and I don’t know if Berserk could use us as well.  And yet, why was he so confident? Was he so strong that he didn’t cause us to worry? Isario, who had been staring at us for a few seconds, relaxed as if he was slumping his shoulders, and muttered.  </p>
<p>「...I don’t like your way of thinking, but I respect you.」</p>
<p>「It’s for the beauty of the younger generation」</p>
<p>「If at all possible, I’d like you to return to the town in one piece, and not to waste your life on the survivors.」</p>
<p>「For us, there can be no better than the safety of the Hydrangeas and Berserk. The sacrifices to achieve that are not in vain.」</p>
<p>  Isario let out a sigh. For him, the only thing that mattered was whether or not the hydrangeas would be able to reach the town, and he didn’t seem to want to take into account the sacrifice of himself and his soldiers.  Isario must have mixed feelings because he knew this.  Isario was worried about the old people, but they were killing him. But as an outsider, he had no room for interrogation.  In the end, he decided to split up his troops here. Along with the Militant Nation of Hagane, they evacuated adventurers and knights who could no longer fight.  It was a place where they didn’t know when their enemies would appear.  The troops retreated quickly. Within ten minutes of the decision, the movement began.  Fran raised her hand as she saw off the tail of the convoy. Beyond them was the hydrangea staring at us from the skylight of the carriage.  The hydrangea looked expressionless but somewhat apologetic. Maybe she was worried about them running away by themselves.  However, Fran’s eyes were filled with concern for the hydrangea.</p>
<p>「......</p>
<p>「......Absolutely.」</p>
