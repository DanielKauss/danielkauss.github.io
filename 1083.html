</div><h1>Chapter 1083</h1><p>The dust-soaring wilderness. No trees or even grass covered the area, and the dry, reddish-skinned ground continued to grow. This rugged land that lay between the Kranzel Kingdom and the Shallus Kingdom was not worth using, and because it was not worth using, both countries forced their ownership to separate the center as their border. The unassailable army moved through the wilderness with silence. The only sounds echoed were the strangely hard sounds created by the march and the unpleasant sounds emitted from the rubbing of their armor. I couldn’t hear the sound of their breathing, let alone the words of waste. I couldn’t hear the sound of their breathing, let alone the sound of their useless mouths.  But that was only natural. The most common ones were probably the undead.  They were zombie soldiers who wore armor and continued to walk at the same speed with their spears on their backs.  The undead’s body and equipment were of poor quality, and it was hard to believe that they were a force to be reckoned with.  However, since there were so many of them, they might be able to be used for occupier or diversion. The number of them was probably well over 5,000. Leading the undead army were golems that sparkled like precious stones.  It was not a gem, but a golem made of magic stones. The sight of more than a hundred strangely shaped golems lined up in a row was even spectacular.  armies of what appeared to be the Shallus Kingdom’s army were following, much later than the undead. Was it afraid of the undead or was it going to use them as a means of eliminating them?  Wasn’t it about a kilometer away?  </p>
<p>(Magic stone soldier)</p>
<p>『Yeah. They’re definitely an army of Raydoss』</p>
<p>  I didn’t know if he was Zelyse or his disciple, Ansel, but there was no doubt that he was involved in this invasion. </p>
<p>「Maybe, somewhere...」</p>
<p>「Zelyse’s magic stone soldier」</p>
<p>「I see!  At that time!」</p>
<p>  Gamud clapped his hand and shouted.  He must have remembered the magic stone soldiers that Zelyse was controlling during the commotion in Barbra. Moreover, the magic stone soldiers this time were probably stronger than ever. They moved more smoothly than the ones we fought before.  So, they were the latest type? Anyway, they must be the strongest magic stone soldiers in their history.  </p>
<p>『Well, it doesn’t matter to me whether I’m stronger or not』</p>
<p>(Nn!  All of it is Master’s food!)</p>
<p>『Hahaha!  Yes! I’m sure I’ll get something good for you!』</p>
<p>  But I won’t know what kind of attack will come after all.  </p>
<p>「Gum!  I’ll take care of the magic stone soldier after all」</p>
<p>「Now that you mention it, Miss Hilt had a skill to defeat that thing in one fell swoop」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>「All right! Then leave the undead and the humans behind to us」</p>
<p>「Nn. Please take care of it with Gumped and Urushi」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p> Urushi nodded but Gwad shook his head.  </p>
<p>「Don’t tell me」</p>
<p>「Did you feel something?」</p>
<p>「Hey?」</p>
<p>「?  Aah, something’s coming...」</p>
<p>  Fran and I noticed it at the same time.  There was a flying object approaching at high speed. As we waited for a while, it seemed like a brown wyvern approached us.  Some of it had rotted off, exposing its internal bones and internal organs.  It was definitely an undead. But it was not a Raidos friend.  </p>
<p>「Diaz, Felmus, Eiworth」</p>
<p>『You’re going to have to step on the same level as the strongest old man!』</p>
<p> There were three old men on the back of the undead Wyvern.  </p>
<p>「You’ve come so well, guys!」</p>
<p>「Long time no see.  Gwad, it’s still hot and humid as ever」</p>
<p>「You’re the same good Eiworth, huh?」</p>
<p>  Eiworth, who has experience in fighting in the Royal Capital, is holding the Wyvern’s reins.  Her level of necromancy magic is low, but can she really use a Wyvern like that? Well, it would not be surprising if Eiworth could do anything. </p>
<p>「This man is unwell, you know?」</p>
<p>「You’re Diaz, who still has a bad mouth as usual」</p>
<p>  Diaz was the guildmaster of Ulmutt and an active Rank A adventurer.  He had fought several fierce battles with this old man in a martial arts tournament. He was one of the few people who knew who I was.  </p>
<p>「Stop fighting on the battlefield.」</p>
<p>「Hahaha!  Both of you, don’t cause any trouble to Felmus!」</p>
<p>「Tch!」</p>
<p>  and </p>
<p>「Hmph.」</p>
<p>  He was the owner of the dragon food-loving restaurant, Dragon Restaurant.  He was a string user, Felmus, and he’s still a handsome guy. He’s still a handsome young man.  I don’t think he’s the same age as the others, so he was making youngsters. They were all members of a legendary dragon party made up of Rank A adventurers.  </p>
<p>「I called you to defend Barbra!」</p>
<p>「I called them here to defend Barbra!」</p>
<p>「I thought the town’s defenses were boring, but something was getting kinda amusing!」</p>
<p>「The Kingdom of Shallus caused trouble in the martial arts tournament. So, why don’t you cool yourself down a little?」</p>
<p>「Don’t be too excited」</p>
<p>  The old men were motivated.  Anyways, it was a unique party. I can remember the hard work of Fermus, who seemed to be the leader.  </p>
<p>「We’ll leave the magic stone golems to Fran, and we’ll strike the undead and the Shallus army behind them. Okay」</p>
<p>「Leave it to me!」</p>
<p>「Understood」</p>
<p>「Understood」</p>
<p>  Neither Diaz nor Fermus raised any concerns about Fran. It was probably because they fully understood her power. But there was one question.  </p>
<p>『Is it okay to just call Diaz over here? Are you going to Alessa or the Royal Capital to call her here?』</p>
<p>「Hahaha.  The Royal Capital can be managed by the knights alone.  Alessa will be......  safe...」</p>
<p>『...By the way, weren’t you afraid of Klimut, right?』</p>
<p> L-but that’s not it!  I wasn’t here because I was afraid to fight alongside Klimut-dono! I just couldn’t leave my old friends behind!」</p>
<p>  This old guy is still a freedom.</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Yeah!」</p>
<p>」</p>
