</div><h1>Chapter 1020</h1><p>The giant antidemons that had become spheres rolled down at a tremendous speed. It seemed to be in a form that made it possible to move at a higher speed while eliminating the brittle limbs. On the way to the castle, we fought a similar enemy. It may not be an unusual form for antidemons. </p>
<p>「Ruuoooourgh!」</p>
<p>「Haaah! Burn!」</p>
<p> The giant antidemons charge at us, and Mea ignited the flames. However, the surface of the flames easily repelled him, and he couldn’t stop his huge body. His defenses were higher than I had imagined. It had a higher defense than I had imagined.  When it attacked a pervert in order to interfere, the Great Magic Beast was normally damaged. Well, they were regenerated instantly, so the effect was only to delay them a little.  But now it was almost no damage. After realizing that it was useless to attack recklessly, Mea launched a slightly different kind of attack. She activated her magic not directly on the main body, but between the ground and the antidemons.  A huge explosion then occurred. The focus of the attack was to knock her off balance by using shockwaves and other such means rather than offensive power.  However, despite the huge explosion that occurred directly under her body, there was no change in the giant antidemons. Because of the tremendous force of the rush and the weight of the blows, they were unlikely to be frightened by a slight impact.  </p>
<p>「Then, you’re going to fight from the side!」</p>
<p>  Realizing that it was difficult to fight head-on, Hilt attacked from the side. She struck from the side, with little force of movement. Hilt was being deflected as if she was deflected, but the antidemons only seemed to have a slight delay.  As we were looking for a way to deal with this, the giant antidemons caught up with Fran and Hilt and overtaken them. At this rate, Jayne’s military stealth ability would be caught up with them and destroyed before they could even be activated.  Fran chased by the giant antidemons with all her might and unleashed her Heaven Judgement.  </p>
<p>「Raaaah!」</p>
<p>「Uuuooh!」</p>
<p>『That’s a hell of a shock!』</p>
<p>  While the high-pitched sound echoed through the air, my blade deeply wounded the surface of the huge ball. The giant antidemons moved slightly slower, but at the price of it, my blade cracked, and my durability value was greatly reduced.  While the sword blade was being regenerated, the antidemons rolled over again.While regenerating her blade, the antidemons rolled over again.  However, while Sophie’s harp was slow, Mea and Lind approached and rushed from the sky.  I could feel an intense magical power emanating from Sophie’s harp, and Mea’s Lind began to shine brightly.  It seemed to be a magical song that used the user’s magic power to increase the weapon’s attack power.  With an uptempo dance as background music, Mea struck a slash from above. With an explosion that was even louder than before, the movement of the giant antidemons had completely stopped.  It was a blow from the divine sword.  It was frustrating, but I was also defeated by its simple attack power.  However, the antidemons were not going to let go of it either.  They simply blasted Mea away with something like a shockwave from their entire body. No, seeing her moving again with the recoil, did she just give her some energy to move her heavy body?  However, that alone had knocked Mea away and taken a lot of damage. It was just the recoil from moving that huge body, and it seemed to have tremendous power.  Quina was on her way to rescue us, so we could leave it to her.  More importantly, if we had to deal with the giant antidemons, the damage would be enormous.  Hilt, Urushi, and Fran attacked with them, but they couldn’t stop the giant antidemons. The spells of the demonkin were released, but they were completely ignored.  If things continue like this, it really was――  </p>
<p>「Murder them」</p>
<p>「Uuuuurghh!」</p>
<p>  Suddenly, the body of the giant antidemon twisted and twisted. It was as if it had been crushed by an invisible hand.  </p>
<p>『That’s the land magic we know......!』</p>
<p>「That’s it!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  At where Fran pointed, there was an army of about a thousand people and a large man at the front of it. He held a large sword in his hand and observed the antidemons with sharp eyes.  </p>
<p>「It’s tough.」</p>
<p>「Ashwrath!」</p>
<p>「That’s right! Fran, I’m going to have you join too!」</p>
<p>  The demonkin man, wearing an intimidating aura that made anyone tremble, was one of the strongest corners of this continent. He was Ashwrath, an S-ranked adventurer.  </p>
<p>「I’ve never seen such an antidemon before.」</p>
<p>  Ashwrath, who had slipped on the ground without a sound, landed next to Fran.  He then observed the antidemons with a stern expression. Instead of being unable to defeat them, he was surprised that they began to regenerate themselves immediately. As expected of an S-ranked adventurer, he was so strong an enemy that he could not help but wonder.  </p>
<p>「Why are you with the hydrangeas?」</p>
<p>「Well, it’s just a matter of time」</p>
<p> It was the army of General Hagane who seemed to be tangled up. They had been trapped because of the purple barrier, and had come with Ashwrath to find out the culprit of it.  </p>
<p>「It’s gonna be quite hard to defeat it, isn’t it? What happened to Isario and Adar?」</p>
<p>「I don’t know Isario.  He’s under that castle...」</p>
<p>「Seriously?」</p>
<p>「Adar is over there.」</p>
<p>「Is the Divine Sword Knight so weak that I can hardly sense any sign of him?」</p>
<p>  Ashwrath had a bitter look on his face.  His face was probably because he had misjudged his abilities.  </p>
<p>「I can defeat it on my own...」</p>
<p>「Don’t worry, we’re here too」</p>
<p>「You’re right.  We’re counting on you, are you?」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  If Adoru had worked with us earlier, we would have defeated the giant antidemons.  Then, with the help of Ashwrath, someone on par with him, we should be able to defeat them this time. Now that Mea and Sophie are in cahoots, we can see why.  </p>
<p>「First, we need to bring the whole army together.」</p>
<p>「Okay.」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
