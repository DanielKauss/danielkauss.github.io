</div><h1>Chapter 1066</h1><p>We left the town the day after we delivered the refugees from the port town of Dards to lockers.</p>
<p>Our destination was the village of Methelmam, where no one could hear us.</p>
<p>『It seems to be at the end of the mountain road we had climbed. Urushi’s leg should take us about an hour』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Yesterday, the guild master had suggested a reconnaissance request, and Fran had decided to accept it after a little deliberation.</p>
<p>Metermam was a village between our neighboring country of Philias. If they were to be held back, they would be cut off from communicating with Philias. That must be one of the reasons why they decided to let Filurias go.</p>
<p>However, the main reason was for Charlotte’s safety. Charlotte was on the verge of being sacrificed for some kind of ritual. If she was about to be transported to Metelm for that ritual, we might be able to find out more about the details there.</p>
<p>That was the most important reason for the request.</p>
<p>Urushi, who was flying high in the sky, did not even see a shadow on the earth, and he spotted something in front of him.</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>『What is it? Something is flying around...?』</p>
<p>It wasn’t as high as we were, but something black seemed to be bobbing in place. It looked like a magic beast with bat-like wings, similar to a daemon...</p>
<p>We could faintly see Methelmam below that flying object.</p>
<p>They hadn’t noticed us yet because we had fooled them with illusion magic and light magic just like when we scouted out Dards.</p>
<p>But what should we do now? It would be a bad idea to attack him out of the blue. There’s a good chance that he’s related to Raydoss, but if that wasn’t the case, it would be troublesome for us.</p>
<p>But in the case of an enemy, it would be too dumb to show up.</p>
<p>Should she launch a surprise attack or show up to look for a reaction?</p>
<p>But we didn’t have to think anymore. As we got closer, the other side clearly noticed us.</p>
<p>She glanced around, her face turned to us. Then, as if she was staring at us, she came up to the same altitude as Urushi. It seemed that she was an opponent with higher detection abilities than we had expected.</p>
<p>(Did they know?)</p>
<p>『Probably.』</p>
<p>(Do you want to attack it?)</p>
<p>『No, wait a minute. When it comes to this, you’d better find out who they are.』</p>
<p>(Got it.)</p>
<p>(Woof.)</p>
<p>「I know you’re there from the flow of air! Reveal yourself!」</p>
<p>Aah―, I see. So it was her ability to use wind and air for detection. If the air current was strange in the sky, where there was no shield, that’s how she’d notice it.</p>
<p>I had no choice but to let Fran and Urushi break the concealment.</p>
<p>「A lot of kids? Who are they?」</p>
<p>「...She’s an adventurer from the Kranzel Kingdom」</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>The moment Fran said that her face contorted violently. Well, with her dark skin, I couldn’t quite understand her expression though.</p>
<p>His voice sounded like that of an elderly man, but his appearance was far from that of a man. Or rather, he was completely that of a demon.</p>
<p>He had jet-black skin, bat feathers, and a slender macho body. His equipment was also jet-black metal armor. With a very refined design, it was obvious that he was equipped with knights and something similar.</p>
<p>A demon in black armor. That only looked like it, but its race was human. Perhaps it had something to do with its demon possession skill. Knights were in a state where they were combined with demons.</p>
<p>「......Leave. We have no way to go in from here.」</p>
<p>「I came to check up on Metelmum. I’ll leave when it’s done.」</p>
<p>「......!」</p>
<p>The moment Fran mentioned Metermam’s name, the man radiated killing intent. Then, he suddenly slashed at her.</p>
<p>「Shii!」</p>
<p>「Muh!」</p>
<p>Fran took that slash and jumped back without any difficulty, but now it was clearly an attack to kill her.</p>
<p>「You want to dodge that thing?」</p>
<p>「Are you from the Kingdom of Raidos?」</p>
<p>「......Needless to say, you’re Raydoss, huh? That!」</p>
<p>「The coward who suddenly slashes at you without even saying his name is surely the Kingdom of Raidos」</p>
<p>「Th-that’s not it!」</p>
<p>「Then tell me your name and department.」</p>
<p>「...Die!」</p>
<p>I didn’t want to provoke him, huh? Apparently, he was not from the Raidos Kingdom, but it would be a problem for him to go to the Metermum.</p>
<p>When I think of demons, I think of the Kingdom of Philias, but I wonder what they’re doing here.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, he would have come to capture Metelm in order to reap the benefits of a war hunter. But Philias was not interested in expanding his territories, right?</p>
<p>Worst case scenario, Philias was also under Raidos’s control, just like Seedrun, so they could imagine an invasion of the Kingdom of Kranzel.</p>
<p>(Master, let’s capture him.)</p>
<p>『Okay』</p>
<p>The fierce aerial battle began.</p>
<p>Her opponent had wings, so she seemed to be used to fighting in the air, but there was too much difference in ground strength. Fran parried all the attacks from the demon knights and slashed her limbs with a counterattack.</p>
<p>If I hadn’t had regeneration, I would have been in a deadlock a few minutes after the start.</p>
<p>「Sh-she’s kid like me...! I have the highest level sword skills in my squad...!」</p>
<p>He had a high level of Sword Saint Skill of 3, so I guess he was very confident. Moreover, he was in aerial combat, which should have been his advantage. He was astonished to be easily defeated in a battle where he could not lose.</p>
<p>As long as we just won, there would be no problem. After all, Urushi hasn’t done anything to help us yet. However, it would be a bit hard to catch an opponent with such high regenerative power.</p>
<p>However, it seemed that our enemies were also not serious.</p>
<p>「It can’t be helped...... Reveal my magic power and my body as my sacrifice! Wind magic!」</p>
<p>Immediately afterward, an enormous amount of magic power enveloped the entire body of the knight.</p>
