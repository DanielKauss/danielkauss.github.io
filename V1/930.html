</div><h1>Chapter 930</h1><p>It had already been ten days since Fran and the others fought off the antidemon horde.</p>
<p>With the antidemons completely defeated, the town was out of danger.</p>
<p>The east gate, which Fran and the others had protected, as well as the other gates, were firmly defending it. It seems that the outlaws had done their best.</p>
<p>We already knew most of the situation since we had heard Sophie explain to Quina horizontally.</p>
<p>At first, they were all wary of Quina’s sudden appearance, but they soon accepted Sophie’s request because some of them had seen her exchange with Zefmate.</p>
<p>It must have been great that Mea’s escort was able to defeat the fire thief and the antidemons within her. In no time at all, she had become a little celebrity as “a fierce maid-san”.</p>
<p>In addition to Quina, Frederick, who was working with Sophie to support them, was also there, so there was no problem escorting Fran and Charon.</p>
<p>Those Fran and Charon had now been transferred to the tower, with Sophie trusted to take care of them.</p>
<p>Nelsh, who had been guarding Sophie, had chosen one of them, so they had no idea who was actually working behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Nelsh, along with Frederick, was leading a group of soldiers into battle. However, he lost consciousness after being caught in the barrage and woke up after the battle ended.</p>
<p>He seemed to be very frustrated about this, and was taking the lead in handling the aftermath.</p>
<p>They even took the initiative to capture the Chief Soldier and other civilians trying to privatize the tower, and to gather information on the slavers and the Dragon King.</p>
<p>The Adventurer’s Guild had discovered that the submaster had tried to escape on his own. Because of this, the other adventurers had been pushed up, and their work was still not going well.</p>
<p>The submaster’s pitiful behavior had lowered public trust in the town, so the chaos was bound to continue.</p>
<p>I’ve heard that many underworld organizations have lost a lot of influence due to this incident. Rumors have spread that they were reluctant to send out their forces even though they usually looked like important.</p>
<p>Based on what we had heard, they had decided in advance to send their forces to the various gates... But from the citizens who stood on the battlefield, they were probably not convinced.</p>
<p>They couldn’t forgive their commanders emotionally, not mentally. I wouldn’t call it a scout, but it would be difficult for the conventional threats against the background of force to work.</p>
<p>After all, it reminded me that citizens must work together to take their weapons. If we didn’t do something wrong, we might end up being defeated.</p>
<p>In the first place, they were allowed to work as an army in case of emergency. But if they found it useless, there was no use in bothering them to leave the outlaws unchecked.</p>
<p>By the time many citizens realized this, the illegal city might change its shape.</p>
<p>However, some of the groups made a great achievement in the midst of that. It was the only Beastmen Union that we had full cooperation with this time. Mea, who had taken control of the Union by defeating all the executives, had instructed them, but they had not forgotten that many citizens had fought together.</p>
<p>Mea had just happened yesterday, but Quina had firmly held the bridle of the Union. She had also made great efforts for the reconstruction, and now she is in a state where one person wins.</p>
<p>The Dragon King Syndicate also fought to fight, but in fact, it was the most powerful organization that had lost power. The Dragon King’s plot was exposed, and the people resented him.</p>
<p>The Dragon King tried to sacrifice Sendia for an evil ritual. Then, a large number of antidemons were led by his subordinates who cooperated with him.</p>
<p>It is no exaggeration to say that the current crisis in Sendia was the result of the Dragon King and his attendants.</p>
<p>Frederick must have been spreading rumors among the citizens to try to make the right statement. His goal was to gather a lot of grudges at the Dragon King and prevent the honest dragonkin from being blamed for participating in the battle.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, it was probably for Velmeria’s sake. She had sacrificed the Dragon King as an absolute evil so as not to be subjected to unreasonable slander.</p>
<p>Velmeria had been awake the day before, and was apparently working to create a new moderate organization under the Dragon King’s control.</p>
<p>The demi-humanized Velmeria seemed to be treated like a superior to the dragonkin, and most of the dragonkin had sworn that they would follow her. Well, Velmeria was viewed favorably by the people, so I guess by becoming her servants, they wanted to prove that they had nothing to do with the Dragon King.</p>
<p>Gazzol and the other three claws who had been selling their names in this battle have been appointed as the top brass of the Dragonmen Guild. This meant that the citizens were friendly with the Dragonmen Guild.</p>
<p>And in the most chaotic Sanatorium, Seliadot and Sophie were on the lookout for reconstruction. They must have bound Filuria and her men, calmed down the healers, and regained the trust of the people.</p>
<p>That may sound like a challenge, but Sophie’s fame was solidified by this incident. The saintess possessed a divine sword and fought at the front of the people, so there was no way Sophie would not become popular.</p>
<p>With the cooperation and trust of the citizens, the tower was rapidly being reborn as a new organization. Sophie said it was going to be an open organization with citizen representatives participating in the management of it.</p>
<p>I don’t know how well this will go, but it looks like it’ll continue to run sound as long as Sophie’s reputation is high.</p>
<p>Filuria was said to be missing, apparently because Quina and Seliadot had worked together. Well, the chaos is great, but if left alive, it will only cause even more chaos. It’s better to pretend that you don’t know.</p>
<p>『Now all that’s left is for Fran to wake up...』</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>The contents of the potion were still nutritious, but they had gotten a little skinnier. Could they be okay if they stayed asleep?</p>
<p>Everyone except Fran was already awake, and I think it was almost time.</p>
<p>Together with Urushi, who had already woken up four days ago, we peeked into Fran’s sleeping face.</p>
<p>「......!」</p>
<p>『Oh? Fran?』</p>
<p>「Woof?」</p>
<p>Did our wish come true? Fran’s long eyelashes trembled slightly. Then, her eyelids slowly moved upwards.</p>
<p>『Fran! What happened? Fran?』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「W-Right...? Urushi...? Where here?」</p>
<p>『That must be the Sanatorium.』</p>
<p>Before I could even ask her how she was feeling, a loud sound echoed through the wards.</p>
<p>Growl―!</p>
<p>Fran was rubbing her stomach with a pitiful look on her face.</p>
<p>「I’m hungry」</p>
<p>『I-I see.』</p>
<p>「I want to try curry.」</p>
<p>Is curry okay right after she’s fasted for ten days? Hard stuff like that is bad, right?</p>
<p>But I’m glad Fran woke up after all.</p>
