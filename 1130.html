</div><h1>Chapter 1130</h1><p>「I see! I’m surrounded!」</p>
<p>『Yeah, the one from Avenger is right』</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p> Based on the information we obtained, we headed for a fort in the Raidos Kingdom, but the end of the battle was already open. Moreover, the Kranzel army was surrounded by enemies on three sides, and it was in a very dangerous situation. As the information showed, there were also red knights. Forrund was face to face with him, but was he an opponent that even that man cannot defeat? How can we save the Kranzel army? It’s not like we just have to rush in without thinking. It wouldn’t be enough to just rush in without a hitch.  As I was running to the battlefield, I was wondering what had happened.  A white light enveloped the adventurers.  Some of the knights, too, seemed to be glowing?  I could feel healing magic, so it didn’t seem to be an attack from my enemies. But the center of that magic was the area where the adventurers were gathered.  A huge amount of magic power gushed out from a single demonkin, a thick, long horn with a body as big as Ashwrath’s. He looked at us from a distance with his teleportation skills, but it was still intimidating and powerful.  But that conspicuous demonkin, Alessa, wasn’t he? Was he a valiant warrior from another guild?  No, wait a minute.  That face......  Could it be Donadrond?  He has changed so much in a such a short time! Her body swelled up, her horns were outstretched, and the quality of the magic power she released had changed considerably.  However, now that the entire battlefield was puzzled, this was our chance.  </p>
<p>『Fran, let’s go help Forrund first』</p>
<p>(Okay.)</p>
<p>  The young magician facing Forrund was probably the vermilion flame knight in the information. I’ve heard that he’s strong, but if we and Forrund work together at the same time, we won’t be able to defeat him.  After hearing his abilities, I guess he’s a subordinate of Isario.  Besides our mobile striker, we also had forces. If we could destroy these undead enemies, we could save the adventurers. In other words, we could still make it in time.  </p>
<p>「Hey, don’t die!」</p>
<p>「Huh!  What the hell, my priestess!」</p>
<p>  It was the undead behind who responded to Fran’s words with great force.  A vicious ghoul that emitted evil energy.  Yes, this was the commander of the Genoside Ghoul, who had attacked us after all. The Genocide Ghouls under his command were also following closely. The ghoul, who called himself an Avenger of the Black Skeleton Army, began to follow Fran for a certain reason.The ghouls, who called themselves Avengers of the Black Skeleton Army, began to obey Fran for a certain reason.  A few hours ago, the Evil Spirit Conquest skill I had used had succeeded in making the Genocide Ghouls suffer.  Don’t move.  Follow me.  Stop the fight.  As I chanted so, I manipulated the evil energy inside the ghouls, and it certainly slowed down. </p>
<p>『But take advantage of this opportunity, and attack it with your attacks!  Slash, slash, and exterminate the evil energy!』</p>
<p>「Nn!  Haaa!」</p>
<p>「Shiiiit!」</p>
<p>  Fran slashed at the ghoul in an attempt to defeat it. However, the blade did not cut through the ghoul.  </p>
<p>「Must have been the priestess!  My priestess!  I did it wrong! Forgive me!」</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>『Huh?』</p>
<p> The ghoul suddenly dissipated his hostility and sat down on the ground. The piercing killing intent he had been aiming for so far was also hiding.  </p>
<p>「Miku?」</p>
<p>「Hah! There was a revelation from the Goddess in her divine vessel that she should obey you!」</p>
<p>  The other ghouls were also gathered around Fran and knelt, as if to match their commander. All but a few of them were already defeated.  Did they mistake the Evil Conquest for the will of the Evil God Fragment? It wasn’t that it radiated tremendous power. However, a small amount of dense pieces of evil energy overflowed and blessed the ghouls.  </p>
<p>「Ooorgh!  My God!  I understand!」</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Ooorghh!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>  The ghouls let out a roar of joy.  If their tear glands had been alive, their tear glands would have definitely broken. As they rubbed their knees and foreheads against the earth, the ghouls let out a voice of reverence for Fran.  </p>
<p>「Must have been the priestess!」</p>
<p>「Must have been the priestess!」</p>
<p>「Guide us!」</p>
<p>  Was it my imagination or did the Evil God Fragment give off a somewhat proud atmosphere?  Anyways, the Evil God Fragment I used against her was nothing. The sudden crazedness of the ghouls―― and their surrender made the warriors and maleficents confused. Even Persona felt a sense of confusion.  Well, you’re right.  Fran was suddenly starting to be revered. Moreover, it seemed that Mareficent could sense the evil spirit due to the pieces of the Evil God doing their own work.  </p>
<p>「Black Lightning Princess-dono?  What in the world is this...?」</p>
<p>「... Something happened.」</p>
<p>「Haah.  Is that sword okay? I could clearly feel a strong evil spirit in it.」</p>
<p>「Don’t worry. With the power to control evil energy, these guys are no longer enemies.」</p>
<p>「Well, Black Lightning Princess-dono is quite calm here.  So, we’ll have to accept it for now.」</p>
<p>  She must have remembered the unwritten rule of not forcing adventurers to listen to each other. Mareficent didn’t rush any further than that. The warriors stared at Fran with reverent eyes as if she had simply dominated the top-ranking undead.  </p>
<p>「H-Holy shit!  Commander! Curry!」</p>
<p>「Must have been the priestess!  I’m the cat ear priestess!」</p>
<p>「Even the cat ear priestess! Curry!」</p>
<p>「Must have been the one hearing the word of God with those black cat ears!」</p>
<p> Somehow, everyone except Mareficent and Persona was worshipping Fran.  </p>
<p>『Let’s talk to the ghouls for now』</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>I hope we can get some info on the Kingdom of Raydoss though.</p>
