</div><h1>Chapter 1006</h1><p>「In order to destroy the dragonkin, we must make some sacrifices first!」</p>
<p>Maybe he was agitated, but he still exhaled violently with his shoulders up and down. His beautiful face contorted in a Prajna-like appearance.</p>
<p>Right now, her sanity seemed to have been eroded into madness.</p>
<p>「......I know how much you want to take revenge.」</p>
<p>Fran’s words were filled with strong feelings. She must be remembering that she had always hated the entire Blue Cat kin.</p>
<p>「Don’t hesitate! You’re saying I’ll let you off the hook then?」</p>
<p>「There’s no way. I can’t blame you for the small sacrifices. Besides, there are many people on this continent that I want to protect. So, I’ll take you down.」</p>
<p>Fran readied me with a pitiful look on her face. She didn’t seem to have any intention of trying to convince Merritte. She probably knew that she couldn’t just replace her with a rational one.</p>
<p>Even Fran had no idea what would happen if the black cats had the same eyes.</p>
<p>「First I’ll kill you! And then I’ll punish all the sinners who live on this continent! Until then, I won’t stop you!」</p>
<p>「I won’t let you do it」</p>
<p>「He’s dead!」</p>
<p>That shout signaled the start of the battle.</p>
<p>Meritte and Fran then began to move at the same time, slamming each other’s weapons at each other.</p>
<p>「That sword... It’s not just any magic sword, is it!? How can it be cut and broken with this sword!」</p>
<p>「The best sword!」</p>
<p>However, I didn’t really get the feel of a high-level antidemon. Rather, I felt like a high-level antidemon.</p>
<p>The thin arm that was slammed onto my blade had an extraordinary amount of power hidden in it. Despite its slender appearance, its status must have been tremendously high.</p>
<p>My kinetic vision seemed to be far from human, and I handled Fran’s sword well. However, Fran clearly had the upper hand in sword skills. Gradually, my defenses ran out, and finally my magic caught me.</p>
<p>「Kuh! You’re going to use magic too, huh!?」</p>
<p>Its body didn’t seem to have taken much damage, but it was still burned by lightning and flame magic, and its half-broken robe was completely burned away.</p>
<p>And as a result, I succeeded in appraising Meritte completely.</p>
<p>『They’re not just any lorelei? They’re antidemons? Just like Nadia!?』</p>
<p>Just like a high-ranking antidemon, it had a body half transformed into an antidemon. On closer inspection, I saw that the body under its clothes had become more tough.</p>
<p>Although there were no features on her face, hands, or other parts of her body, her torso had already mutated into that of an antidemon.</p>
<p>Fran’s eyes widened as she saw that. Nadia and Dubbed must have been unable to hold back all the upset.</p>
<p>He then grinned as he lightly repelled Fran’s exposed chest armor.</p>
<p>「This? It’s amazing, isn’t it?」</p>
<p>「...The body of an antidemon...?」</p>
<p>「Yes. That’s right. Do you know that it’s the failed divine sword?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Hee? The explanation is quick. Both of these swords are failed divine swords. I used that amazing power to get this body」</p>
<p>I never thought there was another failed divine sword left behind besides Overgrowth!? Moreover, it was a fusion of two of them.</p>
<p>Was it a Falldown or an Evil Eater? Either of them must have had some kind of ability similar to Overgrowth.</p>
<p>「Did you do it yourself?」</p>
<p>「That’s right. I’d do whatever it takes to get the strength to fight!」</p>
<p>With the release of antidemons, he no longer had to suppress his power. Meritte began to move even faster than before, fully utilizing the characteristic mana of an antidemon.</p>
<p>However, this time’s attack did not hit Fran.</p>
<p>「...Why are you apologizing?」</p>
<p>「He’s fast, but that’s all. I don’t know how to attack him, but it’s better」</p>
<p>「Then try this! Haaa!」</p>
<p>「I can’t get it.」</p>
<p>「Damn! We’re not gonna do it!」</p>
<p>It had the physical stats and the trickyness of a cruciform magic sword, which was a failed divine sword. That gave it a beating at first, but it soon got used to it and was no match for Fran.</p>
<p>That’s because the level of his swordsmanship was so different. Meritte was certainly strong, but rather, she was strong as a rearguard.</p>
<p>Now it’s his turn to defend. He was able to catch Fran’s attack with a reflex that transcended human beings.</p>
<p>However, she was unable to defend against everything perfectly, and shallow wounds were carved into her skin.</p>
<p>It seems that antidemons are becoming more numerous inside than they looked. There was no blood flowing from the wounds, and they could regenerate instantly. The appearance of the wounds was similar to that of high-ranking antidemons.</p>
<p>This would be meaningless against a puny attack. With a big move, we had to finish him off instantly. The reason why Meritte still had some leeway was probably because she was confident in her immortality.</p>
<p>Sensing this, Fran calmly focused her strength while attacking. She was aware of the magic power that was dormant inside her, while making some moves to block Meritte’s attack.</p>
<p>I never thought that Fran, who had been headacheed by just activating magic twice, would be able to use this much Parallel Thinking. In addition to the magic power she was using in battle, magic power from the Divine Attribute was being built up inside Fran.</p>
<p>Meritte seemed to have noticed as well. Her relaxed smile twitched slightly. But she didn’t have time to run away anymore.</p>
<p>(Master)</p>
<p>『Yeah!』</p>
<p>As Fran stepped forward, I slammed my all-out telekinesis into the cross-shaped magic sword in Meritte’s hand.</p>
<p>It may look like he realized the invisible power of his keen senses, but he can’t dodge it at this close range.</p>
<p>Although she did not let go of the sword, her sword and hand were teleported up above her head. Fran was already in front of her when Meritte was about to pull back the cross-shaped magic sword.</p>
<p>「...!」</p>
<p>Meritte’s face contorted in frustration as she realized that she was not able to make it in time. She probably didn’t expect a girl as a bonus S-Ranked adventurer to be able to do this much.</p>
<p>(I can use it now.)</p>
<p>Fran cloaked her body in Divine Attribute magic power. Black lightning mixed with pale blue light radiated a radiant shine.</p>
<p>「Sword God Transformation!」</p>
<p>As soon as Fran muttered this, a slash at a ridiculous speed was fired at him, and he cleaves mercenary torso.</p>
