</div><h1>Chapter 989</h1><p>「Balfon-sama! I have brought you the Southern Duke, Sibyld-sama!」</p>
<p>「In.」</p>
<p>「Buhohohoh. It’s been a long time since I’ve been under the Eastern Duke.」</p>
<p>「Yeah, I’ve come a lot from the south.」</p>
<p>「What do you wanna do here? About the Western Duke’s movements?」</p>
<p>「What’s wrong with the west side?」</p>
<p>「Now that we have almost Seedrun in our hands, we must have the water dragonkin as well. Now our control over the sea is almost at ours. We need to finalize that plan, don’t we?」</p>
<p>「Kyushi. Well, that’s another time. Neither I nor the Southern Duke can say that they’re ready. Right?」</p>
<p>「You mean those flies then?」</p>
<p>「Flies? Who are they? Those red knights?」</p>
<p>「No. They were a strangely strong old man and a half-insect mercenary group. They would try to free their friends, and sometimes even refuse to use force.」</p>
<p>「Looks like there’s a lot of them in the southern territory, you know?」</p>
<p>「Bufun. Divine Attitudes. There are always collaborators in our territory. We’ll have to uncover them first.」</p>
<p>「Why don’t we help them?」</p>
<p>「Bufou. No need. We’re gonna do with that creepy, man-made superhuman being, okay? I’ll create an force that we can’t control too」</p>
<p>「I’ve gotten some good data in Gordicia, alongside Kranzel, Seedrun, and Belioth. The true completion of my research is approaching! Besides, there’s probably a hint of dread in your undead!」</p>
<p>「No army is as useful as the undead, right? Without any words, no complaints, and no complaints, they would keep moving forever as long as their magic power remains. Besides, the cost of burying the dead will also skyrocket. Bufopho! That’s just a gain!」</p>
<p>「You’re saying it’s like the west, aren’t you?」</p>
<p>「Bufun! I’m better than the guardian!」</p>
<p>「Besides, I’m not complaining about that. You’re different, right?」</p>
<p>「They’re all just like other immortals after all. I have a contract with them!」</p>
<p>「You said Nameless? But I don’t think you’d bind that thing with a contract?」</p>
<p>「Bahhaha! This is a new kind of magic! Let’s not waste the documents from the floating island!」</p>
<p>「Hou? That sounds interesting」</p>
<p>「Besides, the saintess they adore is in their plan. They won’t do anything without a contract.」</p>
<p>「Are they a special kind of undead that would allow the mother of rational undead?」</p>
<p>「Indeed. The only undead in the world who will give birth. Oh, Sibylla of the Red Sword, you could also call her mother」</p>
<p>「Sibylla, huh! Shishi! That’s good! That one is really superhuman! I didn’t know it hurt that the laboratory was destroyed. Well, I’ve pulled up the data, so I’m glad to hear that」</p>
<p>「Bufhun...... Because of your presence in my territory, it is still believed that this research was led by me, right?」</p>
<p>「I’m sorry for that. But it was just a joint research, so can’t I blame you?」</p>
<p>「I’ve tried to get resented by the red knights. Besides, the Red Sword Order has many survivors of the laboratory, so I don’t know what they’ll do next, you know?」</p>
<p>「One of the guys behind that mercenary group must be the Knights of the Red Sword. That would prolong the fight」</p>
<p>「Bufh. The Prime Minister’s Dogs! Even though they were all aiming to invade Alessa... they’ll have to settle the war in their territory first!」</p>
<p>「Kishi. I’ll be helping you at any time, you know?」</p>
<p>「I’ll have to destroy it as soon as possible for that plan. So? Tell me why you called me here, okay? I don’t have any free time, do I?」</p>
<p>「My reason for calling her was the story of the failed divine sword from Gordicia that you had asked me to use.」</p>
<p>「We made a lot of progress, huh!? No undead on that continent. I couldn’t manage it well, but at least I can!」</p>
<p>「I’m not」</p>
<p>「Buf? But the story is about a failed divine sword, right?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. It’s a failed divine sword, but there has been no progress. No, maybe we made progress if things progressed」</p>
<p>「...What happened?」</p>
<p>「First, the Golden Devourer Sword, Overgrowth, was destroyed.」</p>
<p>「W-What the! Not even a Divine Sword, just a failed Divine Sword! Moreover, it has accumulated so much power over the years! Was it destroyed? Such stupidity...!」</p>
<p>「Jeez. It seems the current wielder of the adventurer’s woman was destroyed in the middle of a battle against high-ranking antidemons.」</p>
<p>「Are you sure this adventurer is lying?」</p>
<p>「The body, which had been half antidemonized, has returned to its original state, and there is no sign of a divine sword at all. I’m sure it’s not dead.」</p>
<p>「Just like the Ebiru Eater, it even reached Overgrowth...... So, the only remaining failed divine sword is to fall down?」</p>
<p>「That’s right. But there was a problem with that too」</p>
<p>「What is it?」</p>
<p>「Anyone in the alley who had infiltrated it lost their sanity.」</p>
<p>「Wha! You shouldn’t be able to follow the falldown then!」</p>
<p>「Yeah, this is just my fault. I’ll apologize. Sorry.」</p>
<p>「I’m sorry! I have the ambition of my strongest army!」</p>
<p>「I’d love to have the discarded Divine Sword data. It’s the same feeling of frustration. Now that Ebiru Eater was out of control, the falldown was the only clue to manipulating evil energy, you know?」</p>
<p>「Weren’t you building a collaborative relationship with the wielder?」</p>
<p>「Indeed. Maybe that little girl has noticed my intentions, or maybe she originally intended to throw it away......」</p>
<p>「Fufun. That’s not gonna work」</p>
<p>「Yeah. Anyway, let’s move the people in Gordicia to find out what’s going on. I’ll be waiting for that information」</p>
<p>「......It can’t be helped. I need you to hurry as fast as you can.」</p>
<p>「I know. Besides, I’ve gathered some information about the Divine Sword, so I’ll give you the documents later」</p>
<p>「Hou? I’m looking forward to it. Well then, let me tell you the report of our investigation. First, can we start with the appearance of the King?」</p>
<p>「What the hell? You’re doing your job, huh?」</p>
<p>「Of course. Well, the King is still the same. He’s learning every day, leaving his political affairs to the Prime Minister. Hmm, well, he’s a good person」</p>
<p>「Because she’s king.」</p>
<p>「I know. I have no intention of disobeying the king, but I do not want that Chancellor. We’ll have to get rid of her eventually. She’s still moving like before.」</p>
<p>『Fran, are you sure?』</p>
<p>「Bufun. That’s right. And the Northern Duke could be the biggest obstacle... I still don’t know anything about him」</p>
<p>「I can’t predict what the north will do.」</p>
<p>「Indeed. But they cannot be enemies.」</p>
<p>「The Northern Knight Order, for example! How can I get such a powerful knight......? I’d like to hear your secret.」</p>
<p>「Buffu. You’ve heard of that, haven’t you? If you keep reaping the magic beasts from morning till night for the rest of your life, anyone will become stronger. That’s right」</p>
<p>「Yeah, he’s even madder than me!」</p>
<p>「Of course. The treasured sword in his hand is terrifyingly strong. No one can beat him in the north, so it’s foolish to even try it.」</p>
<p>「Indeed. But even so, in the north, Sibylla of the Red Sword, Shuzenka of the Scarlet Eye, Weena Rhyn of the High Elf, Jean of the Undead, and the demon knights directly under Diaz. They’re all troublesome both inside and outside.」</p>
<p>「Eventually, the day will come when my strongest army will swallow everything」</p>
<p>「You’re pretty confident, just south of here. Are you up to something?」</p>
<p>「Bufopho! I’ll find it eventually.」</p>
<p>「Yeah, I’m looking forward to it then」</p>
