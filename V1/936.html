</div><h1>Chapter 936</h1><p>The next day after the great party ended with a great success.</p>
<p>As we descended from the guild’s lodgings to the training area, we found several adventurers lying on the ground.</p>
<p>「Jeez.」</p>
<p>Fran frowned, while holding her nose.</p>
<p>『The smell of the wine is amazing』</p>
<p>She must have continued to enjoy her drinks even after Fran left for her room. Like that guy, how could he sleep on three floors?</p>
<p>Moreover, there were still people who were enjoying their drinks. At the center of it was Isario, an adventurer with a divine sword.</p>
<p>「Drink and drink!」</p>
<p>「Uhahahaha!」</p>
<p>「She won’t let me!」</p>
<p>「I don’t know what you’re saying!」</p>
<p>「Gyahahahaha!」</p>
<p>That was amazing. I saw nearly 30 booze bottles lying around at our feet, but Isario didn’t seem to be drunk. Even though the other adventurers were on the verge of crushing it, he was probably just gonna get drunk.</p>
<p>So, this was the power of a Rank S adventurer? I heard that people get booze no matter how strong they got, but does alcohol resolution increase as her stats increase?</p>
<p>The way she moaned and laughed stupidly at the booze looked like a middle-aged guy wielding a tube at a tavern. It reminded me of my boss from the department before my reincarnation.</p>
<p>The adventurers around them didn’t seem to be aware of Isario. It must be the effect of his cloak. Well, maybe it was just because they were too drunk to detect people.</p>
<p>Or rather, didn’t he say, “I’ll challenge you to a request in perfect condition”? No matter how I look at it, it doesn’t look like perfect.</p>
<p>Fran thought so too, and approached Isario and Zelos Reed.</p>
<p>「Hey.」</p>
<p>「Oh! You’re the meat girl huh!?」</p>
<p>Even Isario had been recognized by 『Lady in the flesh』! But Fran didn’t seem to care. Rather, she had a look on her face? She may think that this was an honorable meaning for those who rule over the wonderful being of the meat.</p>
<p>「She said I was going to take her request in perfect condition, so I shouldn’t have a mock battle with her」</p>
<p>「Yeah! That’s what she said!」</p>
<p>「Are they all perfect?」</p>
<p>Rather than getting angry, she’s genuinely questioning the situation. Fran, who didn’t drink, didn’t really understand how sick she was.</p>
<p>「That’s right, I’m more empowered to be a little drunk! That’s why I’m in perfect condition right now!」</p>
<p>「I see」</p>
<p>Don’t believe me! Isario...... was completely useless! Who among the S-Ranked adventurers is this honorable!?</p>
<p>「How about a drink with you too?」</p>
<p>「Hmm」</p>
<p>Fran! Hmmm!</p>
<p>「Is the wine good?」</p>
<p>「Totally delicious! Have you ever tasted it? If that were the case, the uncle would think that it was at least ninety per cent of his life!」</p>
<p>Don’t you usually say half of your life? After all, only about 70% of them were undead!</p>
<p>『I won’t let you!』</p>
<p>「......Just a little.」</p>
<p>『No good! No good!』</p>
<p>「Uhahaha! Have a drink and drink! I even learned the taste of the wine when I was five!」</p>
<p>『Damn! Have this!』</p>
<p>Fran’s gaze shook between the cup and me that Isario had offered to her. Fran, the glutton, was probably interested in alcohol. Besides, drinking was what an adventurer should do.</p>
<p>I’m sure she wanted to be able to have a drink in order to become the ideal adventurer. But this was no good!</p>
<p>Anyway, we couldn’t let the current Fran taste the wine. What should we do if she liked it and started drinking now?</p>
<p>Shouldn’t we just use telekinesis to keep up the pressure? It was just as I was starting to worry about it.</p>
<p>「You son of a bitch!」</p>
<p>「Woof? Who is it?」</p>
<p>「I’m the Rank C adventurer, Zefmate!」</p>
<p>「Morley!」</p>
<p>「I won’t let you!」</p>
<p>「Defeating your enemies and making a name for yourself! You gotta be prepared!」</p>
<p>It was a fight at waist height, so I thought she might apply for a mock battle, but she pulled out her weapon without needing a question and answer. It seemed that she was aiming for credit.</p>
<p>If we could beat a Rank S adventurer, we would certainly become well known, but how much would we be reckless?</p>
<p>Two of our friends were clearly in Rank D, so I don’t think they would be able to beat the Divine Swordsman. However, it seemed these guys had a good chance of winning.</p>
<p>「No matter how Rank S you are, you can beat me in drunk! I got you this!」</p>
<p>Isario certainly had a red face and was clearly intoxicated. But would that make it win?</p>
<p>The battle suddenly began, and cheers erupted in the training area. Instead of helping Isario, she began to enjoy the battle as a snack.</p>
<p>No one thought that Isario would lose, rather than being pathetic.</p>
<p>「Isario’s husband, when was he here?」</p>
<p>「Congratulations, you were drinking together, huh?」</p>
<p>「Umm, was that your husband?」</p>
<p>「I didn’t notice it because I was drunk!」</p>
<p>「Even bare-faced, can you see through her husband’s disguise!?」</p>
<p>「Tsk!」</p>
<p>Fran also lowered herself to the wall to see what she was capable of.</p>
<p>『That axe user is pretty strong.』</p>
<p>(Nn. His movements were not bad.)</p>
<p>He didn’t have any magic or scouting skills, but his weapon-based fighting skills were mediocre. I thought he had brain muscles, but he also had intuition and detection skills. He must have used this skill to detect the concealment effect of Isario’s cloak.</p>
<p>Isario dodged Zelos Reed’s axe, which was slashing at him with a shout. He shrugged his shoulders and shook his head.</p>
<p>「Nn. This is from the Kingdom of Belios」</p>
<p>「Keh. The loincloth that was smiling limply even when it was slashed is Rank S, huh!? Even if it’s called the continent of death, it’s still a frontier in the end!」</p>
<p>「Haah. You went pretty well... It can’t be helped. I can’t just do it on my own, but I can’t just make fun of the other adventurers and run away. Let’s give them a shot」</p>
<p>Isario stayed on his slender smile and moved his fingers toward the Zvalve.</p>
<p>「Yes」</p>
<p>「I’m sorry, I was just thinking about something」</p>
<p>I was about to see a match between an S-Ranked adventurer.</p>
