</div><h1>Chapter 977</h1><p>The second unit, which had defeated the super giant-type, tried to enter the town of Shallus without any change, but in the end, they had no choice but to give up.</p>
<p>A large number of antidemons were wandering around the town. There was no sign of any living people, and they had completely fallen down. In addition, we were now carrying Satte’s refugees and the best forces, Isario and Mastuyuku, were worn out and worn out.</p>
<p>We couldn’t push ourselves too hard. They probably had a magic circle that the Dragon King had set up too, but it was too spacious for a short search. We’ll have to leave it alone this time.</p>
<p>「What are you gonna do?」</p>
<p>「I had originally planned to go further west of here and head for the town of Bahar......」</p>
<p>「That giant from earlier came from the west.」</p>
<p>「That’s right. It’s possible that that giant-type came from Berhar...」</p>
<p>That said, I can’t say for sure that he was killed by mere guesses.</p>
<p>We decided to start by heading to Barhar. If we were safe, we would leave the residents of Saate with us. If they were destroyed, we would go to the nearest town from there.</p>
<p>That would be the most reasonable option.</p>
<p>The only problem was, the giant-type was not one that came from Barhar, but Barhar was still attacked by the giant-type. Isario and Zelos Reed had to go into battle not in peak condition.</p>
<p>I was told that Berserk would be released if I tried, but that didn’t mean I would――</p>
<p>Fran was staring at the wagon running alongside her. She must have been thinking the same thing as me, and her eyes were filled with deep melancholy.</p>
<p>(...Master. If we ever find a giant figure, we’ll definitely defeat it with our own hands. I’m sure of it)</p>
<p>『......Absolutely?』</p>
<p>(Nn. Absolutely.)</p>
<p>Fran seemed really determined.</p>
<p>It would be dangerous to let Isario use the Divine Sword any more, and I know that if we use the Divine Sword Release, we will surely lose our lives.</p>
<p>Fran seemed to think that as long as she could defeat the giant-type, no one would be in danger.</p>
<p>As for me, I wanted to say that Fran was in danger, but my resolve would not cover up anymore.</p>
<p>『...First up, let’s see if there’s a giant-type in the town of Barhar.』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p>They were the second unit on their way to Barhar, filled with worry and impatience, but they moved very slowly due to the presence of Saate’s refugees.</p>
<p>She was not physically fit to be an ordinary person, and she had been exhausted along the way. In addition, she was frequently attacked by antidemons. Even if she wanted to increase her speed, it was impossible for the exhausted refugees to walk fast.</p>
<p>It would take us more than twice as long to complete the whole day on our own.</p>
<p>And from our point of view, the people of the Sanatorium were quite patient.</p>
<p>There were no bedding, no clothes, and few breaks. Even on such a road, they didn’t complain at all. But I didn’t know if it was the same for the future. They were a little worried about their food.</p>
<p>We managed to get some water thanks to the presence of this magician, but we couldn’t produce any food. The residents did bring some, but I didn’t think we could cover for everyone.</p>
<p>On the first day, we split the food for each unit, but we were near the limit. In the first place, we didn’t have enough food for our troops.</p>
<p>However, we should not overeat the fighters this time. If those who can fight are hungry, they will not be able to protect the refugees.</p>
<p>However, they would be annoyed if only the combatants were eating beside their hunger. If this continued, the atmosphere of the troops would certainly deteriorate.</p>
<p>It would be pretty bad if we couldn’t get replenished with Barhar. Well, that would happen if we didn’t have my and Fran’s dimensional storage.</p>
<p>Meat alone could cover several days’ worth of food for a thousand people. But if we wanted to feed these people, where should we pay for it later?</p>
<p>Will the council give them a hand? I’m worried since Saate is an illegal city, they won’t officially treat you as a resident after all.</p>
<p>Well, they had no intention of starving us to death, and Fran would be fine if things were to get worse.</p>
<p>But if they ever got a good reputation for serving food for free, some of them would try to gather around for themselves, especially on this continent. That would be troublesome for us.</p>
<p>『It would be best if they could get some food in Barhar』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>I would have really preferred being able to get food in Shouldz, but it was too spacious to find where the food storage was. In the first place, there were too many antidemons, so we could hardly find anything.</p>
<p>While saving a little bit of food, we took another two days to reach Barhar.</p>
<p>Since the plains were unobstructed, the devastation from Barhar was clearly visible. Just like Saatte and Shultz, some of the city walls were destroyed, clearly caused by the giant-types.</p>
<p>There was no sign of any giants anymore, but we could feel the presence of countless antidemons from behind the walls. No matter how I looked at it, they were not safe.</p>
<p>「What are you gonna do?」</p>
<p>「I’m glad there are no giant-types... I don’t think they could take a break in that town, but securing food is an urgent task.」</p>
<p>「Nn. Then, you’ll see me again with us?」</p>
<p>「Could you please? If we fail to find her, we would have to rely on Black Lightning Princess-dono, but in that case, the country will pay the price」</p>
<p>Actually, I had discussed this with you last night. I told her that I was in a hurry to get food, and that I could give her some meat from high-ranking magic beasts.</p>
<p>Then she didn’t ask him to pay for anything, and promised to pay for it. She laughed that it would be quite expensive for the meat of a high-ranking magic beast, but it would be cheaper if she wanted to buy a reputation.</p>
<p>Half of them were probably true. But our reputation had been sufficiently boosted by the fact that we had protected the people of Sende. Half of them were probably concerned for Fran, so they were able to provide them with food without hesitation.</p>
<p>This Militant Nation of Hagane is quite decent, not to mention Silard. They will also consider our convenience as well.</p>
<p>(Master, let’s go)</p>
<p>『Yeah, let’s look for food around these big facilities. I’ll be lucky if they’ve stockpiled it somewhere』</p>
