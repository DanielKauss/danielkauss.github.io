</div><h1>Chapter 1029</h1><p>「Leave the rest to me」</p>
<p>「Nn...」</p>
<p>「It’s your fault because I got the good ones」</p>
<p>「Isario, are you okay?」</p>
<p>「What the hell, the girls weakened you guys are doing. The uncle has to do his best too」</p>
<p> The reason why Fran’s expression was clouding over was because she was worried about Isario. His presence was clearly weak. His level was probably down due to his continued use of the Divine Sword, and the backlash and exhaustion from the repeated fierce battles was probably tremendous. His level must have been down due to the continued release of the Divine Sword, and he must have been through a series of fierce battles and backlashes.  Isario must have realized his limit, but he laughed away with a confident expression on his face. He was begging Fran not to worry about him.  </p>
<p>「Miss Hilt...  can you move? Get as far away from us as possible.」</p>
<p>「Nn......」</p>
<p>『Don’t worry.  I’ll take Fran and Sophie with me.』</p>
<p>「Yeah, I’ll leave the rest to you.」</p>
<p>『......I’ll leave too.』</p>
<p>「Ou.」</p>
<p>  Isario waved his hand and ran toward the giant antidemons. The fact that he wasn’t very fast probably gave us more time to leave.  </p>
<p>『Let’s get out of here!』</p>
<p>「Nn......」</p>
<p> I held Fran and Sophie, who could not move, in my telekinesis and moved to get as far away from them as possible.  I needed to reduce Isario’s burden as much as possible.  The rest of our army also began to move. It would be too early if Urushi helped, but they still couldn’t come out of the shadows.  They must have put all their magic power into that one blow. Thanks to their cannibalism, I was able to recover a lot of magic, but it might have been dangerous if it didn’t work. As I was desperately moving away, I could see a large amount of Divine Power moving behind me.  It was already more than 100 meters away, but I could feel the tremendous heat that Ignis was emitting.  The heat rising from Ignis created a sunlight, which then looked distorted. Moreover, Isario’s body was burned and smoke was rising. The flames swirling around Ignis must be a Divine Flame with such high density that even Isario could not control it.  When Isario swung Ignis, the flames then danced around him.  It was a beautiful sight, but I could see the ground melted and froze due to the flames that had touched the ground. It was as if it was in a hellish pot.  Did Isario, who was clad in divine flames, stimulate my sense of urgency?  The huge antidemons wriggled wildly. What was radiating was a strong evil spirit.  Rather than an antidemon, it was so dense that it looked like a piece of the Evil God. And its body was transformed into a burst.  Dozens of tentacles were created and stretched toward Isario.  Did they still have the power to move like that? Isario calmly activated his technique against the evil-looking antidemons.  </p>
<p>「Divine Sword Art, ‘Fire Jail’.」</p>
<p>  Ignis swung down a small ball of fire. It was like an failed Fire Ball.  But that didn’t happen. Immediately after the red ball flew in a straight line and collided with the giant antidemon――― Gwooooooooh!  A thick pillar of flame rose from the place where the giant antidemons were. The bright red flames ascended in a straight line as if they were trying to pierce the sky. As the tentacles of the giant antidemons wriggled through the pillar of flames, they quickly burned down and disappeared.  Thanks to Isario’s control, the place where we were was was managed to stay was only at a Sacrament level.  However, the amount of heat contained within the pillar of flame was far greater than we had imagined. As the name of the technique implied, it was a hell of fire. Only the excess energy leaking out into the surrounding area was enough to blew away a tropical wind.  Immediately after that continued for a few seconds, the roar and shockwaves suddenly disappeared. And at the same time, the pillar of flames disappeared as well.  And the giant antidemons had completely disappeared.  They had been completely exterminated by Isario’s prison of flames.  Even if I tried to detect any magic power, there was no sign of them. In addition, the purple dome that had covered this area also disappeared.  We won.  </p>
<p>「Shisho, it’s over...?」</p>
<p>『Yeah! I’ve defeated that giant antidemon!』</p>
<p>  Thanks to her continued use of healing magic, Fran’s condition had improved. She may not be able to fight for a while, but she is no longer in a state where she would die of exhaustion.  There was the backlash of the divine attribute, but the burden on Fran due to the significant increase in my magic power has also increased. We need to be careful in the future. </p>
<p>「Isa, Lio...」</p>
<p>『What?  Aah! Isario!』</p>
<p>  I could see the rapidly losing my life force from the collapsed Isario. This was a dangerous momentum.  It seemed that as a result of the price of falling too low, she couldn’t catch the backlash of the Divine Sword. </p>
<p>(Master, save Isario. He’ll be fine all by himself)</p>
<p>『... Okay. Urushi, I’ll leave the two of you to you if it comes to it.』</p>
<p>(Woof.)</p>
<p>  I gently laid Fran and Sophie on the ground and flew toward Isario.  This was bad! I’m in a hurry!  </p>
<p>『Isario!  I’ll definitely help you!』</p>
<p>「...... Ugh!」</p>
<p>  I fired a series of Greater Heals, which I had infused with Divine Power, but they didn’t work at all.  Do I need a higher-level recovery spell?  My current healing magic was Lv. 5. I’ve learned a few techniques to recover from status abnormalities and wide area recovery, but I haven’t yet got a technique that specialized in pure healing more than Greater Heal.  But if I raise my level one or two more, I’m sure I’ll be able to remember it...  No, Isario took good care of me a lot. I’d be willing to use my self-evolution points for this man’s sake.  I used my self-evolution points while continuing to use healing magic, life magic, and support magic. With just one level up, I aimed for a healing spell.  </p>
<p>『Maximum Heal!』</p>
<p>  I recovered a little!  But that wasn’t good enough! It’s better than Greater Heal, but it’s faster to lose my life force!  </p>
<p>『Shit!』</p>
<p>「It’s just a sword!」</p>
<p>『!』</p>
<p>  What the hell?  A presence suddenly appeared!</p>
<p>『Trismegistus!』</p>
