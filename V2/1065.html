</div><h1>Chapter 1065</h1><p>After escaping the town with the liberated Dars people, we continued to walk northeast. There was a town of about a decent size a few days in the inland. We checked the situation there first. Oh, and on the way, we were able to reunite with the adventurers who had escaped. Thanks to this, we had more guards and easier to move around, and Fran was in a good mood. She didn’t seem to have time to chase us on Raydoss’s side, and she wouldn’t show up. In fact, the magic beast was more troublesome. In fact, the magic beast was more troublesome. Based on the information we obtained from the commander, the magic beast user, and the two captives, it seemed that although a small number of scout troops and operation troops left Dars after the Dars occupation, they could not reach a total of 30 people.  This was consistent with the information on Valusa.Based on the information we obtained from the commander, the magic beast user, and the two captives, it seems that although a small number of scouting and operation troops have left Dars after the Dars occupation, the total number of people was no more than 30.  That’s more like what we know about Valusa.  I’m a little worried that he’s planning to occupier some village, but we can just get some info when we arrive at the place of refuge.  Four days after we escaped Dars, we managed to reach the town without leaving any missing persons. The group that arrived was greeted with a welcome of 60 per cent, a subtle face of 30 per cent, and a troubled look of 10 per cent.  The welcome was the refugees from Dars who had lived in tents outside the town. They seemed to be happy that their friends were still alive.  Their subtle faces were probably those of the security guards or some of the residents of this town. They couldn’t honestly happy that there were more people left to cause a ruckus.  A troubled look also seemed to be the residents of this town.  They must be worried about the food problem.  During the war, the number of people suddenly increased by 300. There was no way they could feel a gloomy mood because of the rations.  Let’s just play a part in this. First, I would pile up a few cargo I had stolen from the Raidos Kingdom and show them that this was my bread for the soldiers.  </p>
<p>「Here’s the rice I took from Raidos.  It has a lot of bean and other stuff」</p>
<p>「Ooh!  I-could it be that you’re gonna serve it? I beg of you, I’d love to sell it!」</p>
<p>  This Chief Soldier was a good person, wasn’t he?  Rather than asking him to be nice, he asked me to sell it. I’m sure he’s in the middle of a war, so I’d have to force him to pay for it.  Or was he not very good at it, anticipating the possibility that he still had a lot of it in his dimensional storage?  Then that’s why he was an excellent, visionary man. He could be trusted.  Fran piled up even more crates and opened her mouth. </p>
<p>「I’m the one I took from Raydoss, so I don’t need the money」</p>
<p>「R-really?」</p>
<p>「I don’t have a problem with the money.  Rather than that, I want you to accept the people I’ve brought with me」</p>
<p>「Th-that’s of course true」</p>
<p>「There are also many Dards soldiers, so you can help protect this town」</p>
<p>「Ooh!  That’s a great help!」</p>
<p> The Chief Soldier-san answered loudly as if he had realized our intentions along the way.  Well, my thought was simple, I can provide you with food and troops! Don’t be too reckless since it will help you!」</p>
<p>  All he said was that he was shouting “Let’s not make things too reckless! ” The expressions on the faces of the residents of the lockers who had heard this also eased considerably. After all, they were piled up with a large amount of food in front of them.  However, the current lockers, where thousands of people were gathered together, could only cover for a day. They were called the Magic of Vision.  Well, we can add more when we run out.  </p>
<p>「Where should we bring this?」</p>
<p>「No, we’ll do it for you」</p>
<p>「But it’s gonna be easier if I do it」</p>
<p>「That’s right, but I want to show the residents that so many supplies have been brought in, and I won’t let those who have free time to do anything work. We’re gonna do unnecessary things」</p>
<p>「Done what?」</p>
<p>「We’re in trouble because of theft and theft.  The town’s security situation right now is bad. The sailors in Dars are especially rough, and they don’t like the thugs who were originally here in our town」</p>
<p>  Aah, there must already be a lot of conflicts between the refugees and the residents. Especially among the ruffians, there seemed to be a war of territory. They wanted to tire the idiots who had excess power with their heavy lifting by force, and also to show people a large amount of supplies by transporting them around the town to give them a sense of security.  </p>
<p>「You’re honest with me?」</p>
<p>「If you don’t listen, I won’t let you go. You’ve brought a lot of forces with you after all.  Besides, if you obey them here, they’ll be counted as a force in case of emergency.」</p>
<p>  So, he wanted to make sure that thugs, who were more used to fighting than ordinary people, could be used as forces. As expected of a capable man.  We said goodbye to the smiling captain and headed for the Adventurers Guild.  They wanted to report on what happened in Dars. Even though we were listening to the side, there was not much more information we had heard along the way from Dards.  However, there was one new story to hear. Charlotte had been told that she would be taken to a village called Metermam the entire day.  Then, the guild master who was listening to the report raised his voice in surprise.  </p>
<p>「Is that Metermam? Is it true?」</p>
<p>「Y-yes.  A very important person said so」</p>
<p>「Right now, there are many refugees coming from the surrounding towns and villages in rockers. However, there is not a single refugees coming from Metelmam alone」</p>
<p>  I wondered if they were just getting the information, but it seemed that they were sending adventurers. But if that’s not the case...」</p>
<p>「And the Raidos army also went to the Metermum?」</p>
<p>「Yes.  That’s a possibility」</p>
<p>  The Guild Master’s eyes turned to Fran as he muttered that.</p>
<p>「I’d like to make a request to you.  For example, scouting and rescuing Metermam.</p>
<p>「I’d like to make a request to you. For example, scouting and rescuing Metermam. What do you think?」</p>
