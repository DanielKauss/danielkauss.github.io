</div><h1>Chapter 1012</h1><p>So the young miss went.</p>
<p>It was a condition for a good adventurer to be able to act properly at a time like this. Master must be leading the way. A good duo.</p>
<p>I never thought that we would have two Intelligence Weapons in a place like this... No, maybe it’s because it’s such a place?</p>
<p>The continent of Gordicia is said to be the place where the divine swords antidemons lurk. It would be no wonder if their legends all gathered here.</p>
<p>『Wait, girl!』</p>
<p>I knew that Trismegistus sword, Juanaverta, was an Intelligence Weapon, but this was the first time I had heard that voice.</p>
<p>A guy who’s crazy for jealousy is just as troublesome as a revenge guy for men and women. There’s even a legend that says she’s a calm ice woman...</p>
<p>I didn’t expect him to be this irritated. The cause was the original sin of jealousy. Possessing that skill must have caused him to be dominated by strong jealousy.</p>
<p>The skill that was originally called a “Sin” was a rare skill that only demons could possess. Moreover, the original sin could only be possessed by the highest-level demons.</p>
<p>A furious demon from a battle we had fought during our adventure in a class A dungeon said something like that. He had been angry for a long time, and it had been hard for me to hear him though.</p>
<p>But why does Juanaverta have such an innocent skill?</p>
<p>I’ve heard that he didn’t originally have such a skill. Well, I’ve heard that he was an Elf before his death, so it was no surprise.</p>
<p>They had fought against demons decades ago that possessed the source of jealousy. Then, the source of jealousy robbed them of a certain skill.</p>
<p>But then something unexpected happened.</p>
<p>The skill he tried to steal was so high that the demon could not fully pay for it.</p>
<p>It seemed that the original sin of jealousy was a skill that forced the exchange of skills, etc. between you and the other party. However, the risk was high, and if the price you presented was not worth the value of what you were robbing, the skill would decide the price without your permission.</p>
<p>In some cases, the wielder may even lose their lives, which is quite a risk.</p>
<p>As a result, the price offered by the jealous demon was the original skill of jealousy. In exchange for losing some powerful skill, Juanaverta gained the original crime of jealousy.</p>
<p>This was what Trismegistus was saying, and I don’t think he was lying. I don’t think he still has enough self-consciousness to tell a lie to that man.</p>
<p>I didn’t even know that because of that, Juanaverta was on the verge of going crazy.</p>
<p>I don’t like women like that, but I do need her to buy some time to escape.</p>
<p>「Yo. Let’s have a little fun with me!」</p>
<p>『Kuh! Hey, retreat!』</p>
<p>「You’re not going to call me a kid, are you? That’s the Elves for you」</p>
<p>『Get back in shape!』</p>
<p>It seems like she was dominated by madness, but her thoughts weren’t completely crazed.</p>
<p>「Isario. Say goodbye.」</p>
<p>Juanaverta seemed to have instructed him to ignore the annoying me. Trismegistus tried to bypass me too.</p>
<p>But I won’t let her go!</p>
<p>「...Divine Sword Release! It must be boring to ignore me!」</p>
<p>『Kuh! Don’t interrupt me!』</p>
<p>「Don’t lose when your enemy tells you to stop! Flame dance!」</p>
<p>From the very beginning, I fired up a fire with all my might. The bright red flames scattered around us as if they were waves.</p>
<p>This may not be bad for Fran, but it’s a sure thing that one person can fight like this. After all, we can use all our power for destructive power without holding back.</p>
<p>「Uryaah! Flameblade!」</p>
<p>「As expected of Isario」</p>
<p>「You’re even praised for being expressionless!」</p>
<p>『Okay, Lord! You did a great job!』</p>
<p>He seemed to have succeeded in attracting hostility towards me. Trismegistus suffered only a mild burn, and Juanaverta was half-crazed.</p>
<p>『Cocute suu!』</p>
<p>「Tsk! Flame wall!」</p>
<p>There was an alias of Juanaverta, “Ice Lady”, was she really a wielder of ice and snow magic? And at the top of it all.</p>
<p>The flames I released collided with the ice storm that occurred as if to freeze the whole area, causing a tremendous explosion.</p>
<p>Although it was a defensive technique, it was not evenly matched with the power of a Divine Sword. As one would expect from an Intelligence Weapon. Trismegistus sneaked into it without a sound. It was covered in a large amount of steam and suddenly appeared behind us.</p>
<p>「Kuh! You suddenly turn to be an assassin huh!?」</p>
<p>Trismegistus continued to slash silently, so I couldn’t feel any presence at all. He was able to hide all of that presence.</p>
<p>If I hadn’t been for Ignis’ enhanced heat source detection, my swordsmanship and stealth skills would have been this troublesome.</p>
<p>After all, she’s been fighting with swords for so many years, and I’ve seen how skilled she is at her feet. Now I can understand that Miss Fran, who was able to keep this sword, is once again out of the norm.</p>
<p>But I’m still an S-Ranked adventurer for now! I can’t afford to lose to my junior!</p>
<p>「As expected of Divine Flame. How can I easily burn and melt my defenses? Besides, I’m better than you in defense alone」</p>
<p>「You can’t lose so easily if you use a Divine Sword!」</p>
<p>As she handled his sword, the flames emitted from Ignis burned Trismegistus. The other side was also putting up a barrier, but it was meaningless in front of the divine flames.</p>
<p>My mana and my divine flames collided, causing a swirling of shock and flame heat. The whole area around me was just like hell.</p>
<p>If Fran and Trismegistus got caught up in this, their lives would be on the line. Although Trismegistus’ whole body is beginning to glow, he doesn’t lose his composure.</p>
<p>She was as immortal as I thought. I can’t stay still in this state! I have to get serious!</p>
<p>「Don’t worry, just die once! Flame!」</p>
<p>「This is my first time here.」</p>
<p>「Yeah! Even your proud eyes couldn’t see through this technique?」</p>
<p>「Yes. That’s certainly a Divine Sword. It seems he wasn’t able to see everything in its entirety」</p>
<p>What I used was one of my trump cards, the Divine Sword Art, “Flaming Body”. Well, the key was to transform my body into Divine Flame. I’m now like a Divine Flame taking the shape of a human being.</p>
<p>The enemy’s attacks were fine, and on the contrary, the divine flames flared up at the slightest touch. Any normal human being would not be able to erase them and become ashes.</p>
<p>「Hmm」</p>
<p>「You can easily erase it too!」</p>
<p>「It’s not. It has consumed a lot of divine power」</p>
<p>Trismegistus had Divine Dragon Form. If we could handle the same kind of divine attribute, we would be able to deal with it. But this technique is not just about defense and counterattack, is it?</p>
<p>「Orra!」</p>
<p>「Since when? I didn’t feel any mana in there.」</p>
<p>The essence of the flame body was its ability to assimilate against the flames that spread around it. It was not only capable of absorbing and healing flames, but it could also appear from anywhere with flames.</p>
<p>Rather than teleporting, it was more like flames were me and I was everywhere. To them, it would look like instantaneous teleportation without any preliminary movement or preparation.</p>
<p>A large number of flames had already scattered around him, making it look like he was fighting in flames. In this situation, it was next to impossible to catch a glimpse of my movement.</p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>『My Lord! S-Stop that little bitch! This!』</p>
<p>That’s more than enough to stop her.</p>
<p>Appearing from everywhere, each blow was a blade of divine flames. No matter how legendary their opponent was, they had no intention of falling behind. The ice and snow magic that Juanaverta unleashed was also blocked by the flames and disappeared.</p>
<p>「Keep going back to the throne――Uoh?! What the hell is this!」</p>
<p>The antidemons we had just fought were emitting extraordinary magic power. They had been delaying this because they couldn’t move, but they hadn’t been able to defeat it in the aftermath of our battle. In fact, they had been strengthened.</p>
<p>Where’s this girl, Merit? I can’t sense her because of the sudden swelling of the antidemons’ presence!</p>
<p>「It looks like she’s ready」</p>
<p>「What are you trying to do?」</p>
<p>「This is the creation of an antidemon with power that has never been seen before. We should have defeated the antidemons that serve as the vessel first.」</p>
<p>What are you saying? The creation of the strongest antidemons? That would be against the goal of Trismegistus, right? And yet, why don’t you stop?</p>
<p>「What are you even trying to do!?」</p>
<p>「I always have one goal in mind」</p>
<p>I didn’t get it, but it was bad! The antidemons began to swell!</p>
<p>「You shouldn’t be taking advantage of that, huh?」</p>
<p>「Gugah!」</p>
<p>It managed to dodge my damage even while I was in flames! I’m making perfect use of my Divine Attributes! Shit, focus...!</p>
<p>『I’ll make effective use of the Divine Sword!』</p>
