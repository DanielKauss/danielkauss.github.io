</div><h1>Chapter 1052</h1><p>Fran, who had turned her back to Marl, ran over the enemy fleet and was able to guide him in an interesting way. He was following Fran and rushing in a straight line. Perhaps it was thanks to his increased magic power, Marl was able to fly through the air with only his wind magic. Fran and the others then went towards the water dragonkin without paying attention to the other ships. When they tried to jump into the water dragonkin with an aerial jump, a layer of light stopped Fran’s rush. </p>
<p>「Heheh!」</p>
<p>『A barrier huh!? It always hasn’t been able to identify its enemies!』</p>
<p>  Fran struck her in the face and looked strange.  It seemed to block her teleportation, so she couldn’t get through.  However, she didn’t seem to have the ability to counterattack, and she was standing on top of the barrier. Sometimes attacks came from each ship, but they were only able to be repelled by my barrier.  </p>
<p>『Well, how about Marl?』</p>
<p>「Gugyaaaah!」</p>
<p>「Got it!」</p>
<p>  Fran evaded Marl’s attack and landed a large hole on the deck of the water dragonkin. The barrier and the damage transfer were not working. Although it was just as we had intended, we could no longer ignore him and take over the water dragonkin when this happened.  </p>
<p>『Alright, let’s just sink it from the surrounding ships!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p> In contrast to our joy, the enemy crew members were here.  </p>
<p>「Stop that! What are you alchemists doing!?」</p>
<p>「That’s why we shouldn’t have relied on the power of the Eastern Madmen!」</p>
<p>「Aah, Princess Marl... What a pain you see!」</p>
<p>「This little princess, take care of those guys from Raydoss!」</p>
<p>  I can hear all kinds of cries. The ones who are angry with him are probably those from the Kingdom of Raydoss. Fran used the barrier as a foothold to run around, and Marl’s attacks guided them toward the large ships in and around Raydoss.  Some ships were hit by ice bullets on their side and had large holes pierced in their hulls.  Some were frozen and began to crack in their hulls. Some ships were frozen by the wide range of cold air, and the number of casualties was increasing at a tremendous pace as time goes by.Some ships were hit by ice projectiles on their sides and had large holes pierced in their hulls.  Some were frozen and began to crack in their hulls.  Some were even frozen by the cold air over a wide area.  The damage was increasing at a tremendous pace as time goes by.  As I thought, Marl’s attacks seemed to pass through the enemy barrier and were never blocked by the water dragonkin or the surrounding ships.  Some of Seedran’s ships even began to attack the Raidos Kingdom taking advantage of this opportunity. They didn’t seem to be carrying a bow or an arrow, and it was a suicide attack that struck the hull.  As the chaos continued to spread, something strange began to happen to Marl.  </p>
<p>「Guga, Ga, and Aaaaaaaaah!」</p>
<p>「Does it seem to have gotten bigger?」</p>
<p>『Yeah, it’s not wrong.  It’s sucking the sea and increasing its body volume』</p>
<p>  Marl was starting to grow huge.  Originally, a small girl was about five meters high. It looked strange as if a girl’s face was on the body of a giant demon.  The body seemed to be muscular at first glance, but it didn’t have any muscles inside it. Its body, which was made of ice, seemed to be more like a being whose magic power was compressed and formed by ice. At the same time, the magic power it wore was also showing an unusually high.  It seemed that the magic power that could not be held back in its body was leaking out into its vicinity as strong cold air.  At the very least, Marl had turned into a being that could freeze its surroundings just by being there without doing anything. It was as if he was constantly firing ice and snow magic, diamond dust.  </p>
<p>「Gyaaaaah!  My arm is...!」</p>
<p>「Y-Yeah――」</p>
<p>「Hime-sama, you’re coming first」</p>
<p>「Grandfather of the Sea of Seedran!」</p>
<p> The damage was far beyond our expectations, spreading not only to the ships of the Raidos Kingdom but also to the ships of the Seedran Sea Kingdom.  About ten minutes later, the combined fleet of the Raidos Kingdom and the Seedran Sea Kingdom was worthless.  About 30% of the ships had sunk, and almost no ship was still safe. Half of the remaining ships were large holes in the frozen surface of the sea, making it difficult for them to move. Even if we could just go back home, more than half of them would have sunk.  The water dragonkin was still alive and kicking.  Before I knew it, the damage to the hull had been repaired. It wasn’t first aid, but the wounds had disappeared cleanly.  Come to think of it, it was a world where swords and armor were instantly repaired by magic and skills. It wouldn’t be surprising if they had skills as a ship carpenter or a skill to fix ships. They should need a lot of magic power, but we could split that up from the water dragons.  </p>
<p>『That’s a more troublesome ship than I had imagined!』</p>
<p>(What do we do?)</p>
<p>『... Fran.  You already know about it, don’t you?』</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p> The remaining major threats were two.  One of them, the Water Dragon ship, was still guarded by the barrier. Moreover, as long as it had the repair ability, it would be necessary to attack it in an instant.  It would be difficult to unleash such an attack in a situation where Marl was going out of control and was persistently attacking it. Well, not that I couldn’t do anything impossible, but......  If we were able to neutralize our enemy fleet so much, we would have to get into the water dragonkin and take them over. </p>
<p>『Let’s defeat Marl first』</p>
<p>「... Nn」</p>
<p>  Fran understood this.  She must have purposely avoided thinking about it. The trauma has bound Fran’s mind even more than she had imagined.  She even used the detour method of using Marl to defeat each other, forcing her to prolong her time. This was the first time that Fran, who was always serious about battle, had fought in front of a strong enemy and was even said to be licking it. However, it was already difficult for her to keep ignoring Marl.  Marl immediately chased Fran as she jumped up into the sky.  The tag game was about to end.  </p>
<p>「... I’ll do it」</p>
<p> Fran stared at Marl with her straight eyes, but her feelings still seemed to be shaky. Was she really okay? However, as if to put a damper on Fran’s resolve, another incident was occurring on Marl. </p>
<p>「Grrrrooof!」</p>
<p>  Suddenly, his body was twitching and he began to suffer. The wind magic that was floating in his body disturbed, and his body tilted. Then, words other than a roar leaked out of his mouth.  </p>
<p>「Aah...  Everyone is dead――」</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>『Your reason has...  returned?』</p>
<p> When I looked into his eyes, which were dominated by madness and wildness just a moment ago, I was sure that the color of reason had returned.  It was the eyes that could sense human emotions.  However, what leaked out of his mouth were words that were not rational. It was a mutter of lament, filled with crazed despair. Apparently, she had some memory of being out of control.  From her face, the signs of complete outbursts had disappeared, and she looked like a sad girl. Tears poured out of her eyes, frozen from the edge and crumbled away. At the same time, she seemed to remember how she had killed a person from the Sea of Seedran with her own hands.  At the same time, the vicious cold air that was pouring out of Marl had been surprisingly weakened. It was probably not because her power had been weakened, but because it was properly controlled.</p>
<p>「......</p>
<p>「......This is hell......?」</p>
