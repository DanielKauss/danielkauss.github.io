</div><h1>Chapter 1061</h1><p>After making up her mind to destroy the Raydoss fleet in Dards, Fran dived and jumped out.</p>
<p>『I don’t see a small ship for a sacrifice in this fleet』</p>
<p>It was made up entirely of large and medium-sized ships. If that’s the case, wouldn’t it be possible to transfer damage from one fleet to the other? That was possible because of the water dragon’s magic power and Marl’s abilities. I wonder if it was impossible to do so with this ordinary fleet that didn’t have either of them.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we decided to first visit the flagship.</p>
<p>『Fran! It’s the biggest ship over there! Let’s do it!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>This was a Kanna Kamui, the same type that we fired at Barbra against the water dragonkin.</p>
<p>Lightning rained from the sky down on the ship, which seemed to be our flagship.</p>
<p>However, a transparent wall suddenly appeared between Kanna Kamui and the ship. It seemed that there was a barrier after all.</p>
<p>The transparent wall that unfolded caught my thunder――but it didn’t.</p>
<p>『Huh?』</p>
<p>「Muh?」</p>
<p>The Kanna Kamui easily punched through the barrier and landed a direct hit on the ship. With the huge explosion, the fragments of the ship’s body splattered in all directions.</p>
<p>The three masts that the large ship was proud of were erased by lightning, and the hull of the ship was shattered from the middle. The remaining remains were also gradually sinking into the sea.</p>
<p>The surviving crew members were also affected by the electric shock of Kanna Kamui and were paralyzed, making them unable to swim properly. I could see them struggling and sinking along with the rubble.</p>
<p>『I knew it, that powerful barrier was probably thanks to the water dragonkin.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Even if they were to be mounted on a normal ship, it would not be very effective due to the lack of magic power.</p>
<p>「...I’ll do it.」</p>
<p>『Yeah!』</p>
<p>Fran’s short words were filled with a wary intent that made me laugh. Like I thought, her anger at the Raidos Kingdom had not disappeared yet.</p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>『Let’s go!』</p>
<p>Fran, who was carrying the giant me, jumped on a nearby ship. She readied me, in my anti-ship mode, upwards, and swung me down to the ship below.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, there was almost no sound of cracking. I could hear the sound of wood scraping against each other lightly, and a large trench was drilled into the sea.</p>
<p>For the opponent, the ship was split in front of them before they could even understand. A split second later, a fire hand rose from the cut at the cut surface, and the hull ignited.</p>
<p>In addition to her anti-ship mode, she also used Elemental Sword, Fire. Amid the screams of the crew members, the battleship sank into the sea surprisingly easily.</p>
<p>From then on, it was time for them to be destroyed.</p>
<p>Fran ran around in the air, gradually splitting the ship in half. Some ships had their torso cut in half, others were split in half from the front to the left and right.</p>
<p>The Raydoss fleet was igniting and sinking one after another.</p>
<p>The ships of the Raydoss Navy were not weak by the standards of this world. They looked like wooden sailing ships, but they were strengthened by magic tools in terms of strength, speed, handling, and everything else.</p>
<p>Even if not a modern battle ship, it was supposed to be as powerful as an old cruiser. It was also loaded with several cannons with high precision hitting. If there were thirty of them, it could be said that they were one of the strongest class fleets aside from the water dragonkin.</p>
<p>Fran, on the other hand, was much better at this. She was smaller, faster, and had better evasive abilities. Yet, she could fire consecutive shots with a single powerful strike that could destroy a ship.</p>
<p>From their point of view, it would be like using a modern, reasonably capable ship against the human-type mobile weapons in science fiction. There was no way we could win against them.</p>
<p>We were wary of any secret measures against strong opponents like Marl, but there was no sign of them coming out.</p>
<p>After about ten ships had sunk down, they realized that Fran couldn’t be helped. Some ships began to run away, but there was no way they could escape.</p>
<p>「Master, please do over there!」</p>
<p>『Got it!』</p>
<p>Fran got ahead of herself and destroyed it from the ship she was running to first.</p>
<p>「Gyaaaaah! I came here!」</p>
<p>「No no!」</p>
<p>「Black demonkin!」</p>
<p>The ship’s crew members, who had been cut in half as the mast passed each other, fell into the sea with a scream.</p>
<p>I didn’t care about those men at all, Fran ran toward the next ship. If Fran approached the ship, the ship would be cut in two, and the hull would flare up.</p>
<p>It was nothing short of a nightmare for her enemy. Besides, this was probably a sign of Fran’s high level of killing intent.</p>
<p>The barrage then began to focus on Fran. However, there was no way it could hit, and in just ten minutes, more than ten ships had been sunk down.</p>
<p>That’s one ship each at a high pace.</p>
<p>However, it seemed that her bloodlust was starting to cool down, and she was less insistent on slashing directly with her own hands.</p>
<p>「Let’s clear it up with magic. Master, take care of that over there」</p>
<p>『I’m on it』</p>
<p>We unleashed a series of magic attacks to clear up the remaining ships at once.</p>
<p>About twenty minutes have passed since the battle began.</p>
<p>All the enemy ships vanished with the sea moss. To win, we won, but one question remained. Like we did in Barbra, the Raidos ship did not try to raise the flag at all.</p>
<p>Brunen of Belioth had told me that there was a white flag tradition in this world. I guess he had the pride and the will to not just surrender at all?</p>
<p>「Phew... I won.」</p>
<p>『Yeah.』</p>
<p>「This time I’m going to go help those in captivity!」</p>
<p>『Are we going to Gordicia right away? I think we should take a break.』</p>
<p>We won the tournament unscathed, but both our magic and physical strength were considerably exhausted. As one would expect from a giant ship, we had to attack it seriously to sink it, and we were so excited that we split up our paces...</p>
<p>It had completely stopped, and we were moving at a high pace.</p>
<p>However, Fran wiped the sweat from her forehead and turned her eyes to the town of Dahz.</p>
<p>「Let’s help Charlotte faster」</p>
<p>『Well, that’s what she says』</p>
