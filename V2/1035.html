</div><h1>Chapter 1035</h1><p>「Divine Punishment......? Why am I wrong! I didn’t commit any crimes! It’s the dragonkin who’s at fault! And don’t just try to exterminate the pests! In the first place, the Gods who made those lizards were at fault! It’s not wrong for me to be guilty for killing those lizards! I’m not wrong!」</p>
<p> They’re even beginning to pass the blame on to the Gods. I wonder if once they’ve died, they’re starting to recover? In the midst of an unbearable scream, the God of Wind and Tree told me one word.She’s even beginning to transfer her responsibilities to the Gods.  Is someone’s death even more re-opening?  In the midst of the unbearable screams, the God of Wind and Trees told me one thing.  </p>
<p>「Human sin can be judged by men.  Your sin is the use of the Abyss Eater.」</p>
<p>「Then, what about Georg?!  Bring him back to life and give him a proper punishment!」</p>
<p>「Georg was given the role of his son by the pieces of the Evil God. Therefore, this thing is not a crime.」</p>
<p>「Hah?  The ties?  Does that mean he has some kind of connection?  The Evil God? With Trismegistus attacking him?」</p>
<p>「That’s right.  The pieces of the Evil Gods that have taken in the Abyss Eater are trying to liberate him. Therefore, it can empower something like Trismegistus and Georg to think about destroying the Abyss Eater」</p>
<p>  I see. They were somewhat equating the Abyss Eater with the pieces of the Evil Gods contained in it, but that was not the case.  Well, if the pieces of the Evil Gods gave them power, they would usually go out of control. Maybe that was the reason why Georg was so strange.  Trismegistus was one of the strongest people in this world, so he must be able to resist his control. Unconvinced by what he says, Merritte shouted even more towards the Gods.  </p>
<p>「In the first place, you’re an Evil God, aren’t you?  Isn’t that a Evil God!?  What’s wrong with using it!? You are also the ones who destroyed it yourself long ago, aren’t you!?」</p>
<p>「Gods are Gods.  It is a crime for a person to unreasonably invade a God’s principles. Sinners, take your punishment」</p>
<p>「Why!  Why are you so foolish!?  Why am I――」</p>
<p>  And so, the God suddenly left.  So, by ascending to the sky at high speed, was the place where the Gods are? Maybe that’s not a lie, since the legends say they live on the moon.  Amidst everyone’s astonishment, Merritte also disappeared at the same time.  They must have been sent by teleportation somewhere. Could it be the castle of Trismegistus?  If so, they don’t want to go closer and closer to that castle. Well, it was shattered now though.  The fact that Trismegistus had disappeared may mean that the area around the throne room where he was heading was safe.  No one uttered a voice for a while, but Isario was the first to make a move.  Then Jayne and Mea began to raise their voices. Perhaps Divine Sword Magic-Users had a strong resistance to Divine Power. </p>
<p>「I can’t stay in here forever, so I have to decide what to do.」</p>
<p>「It’s necessary to check the castle, you know?」</p>
<p>「We’ll have to transport the injured too.」</p>
<p> After that, we split up into two groups.  One was to check the area around the castle, the other was to Isario, Seliadot, Jayne, the demonkin, and a small number of dragonkin elites.  The rest were returnee troops that rescued, cared for, and transported the injured.  The other was dwarves with high transport abilities. Mea and the other Beast Kingdom members, and Hilt’s Dimitris style disciples were also in the return group as escorts. We were the ones going to the castle.  We really wanted to join the return troops, but I was still wondering about Trismegistus’ condition. I also wanted to check to see if Franaverta would be resurrected.  I asked her if she had any spares, and she replied that she didn’t.  But what if she was going to resurrect it with Trismegistus without any spares?  The clothes she wore would be resurrected together with her. Maybe even Juanaverta was back.  I wanted to make sure that.  We walked to the wasteland together.  The reason why they were not so enthusiastic despite having won was probably because there were many sacrifices. There were also many shocking events, such as Trismegistus’ madness and the Divine Punishment against Meritte.  Everyone was walking silently without any words.  No wait, Jayne was talking to her subordinates happily.  To my surprise, she didn’t give us so many eyes. I made a huge move, but I guess it was as if I had such tools and skills as a Divine Sword or a giant antidemon.  </p>
<p>(Master, are you okay?  I’ve absorbed Juanaverta too.)</p>
<p>『Yeah, for now, I’m fine.』</p>
<p>  I was worried that I might take in the original sin of jealousy, but I was fine. But in cannibalism, unlike magic stone absorption, it’s not like taking all the skills of the other party as they are.  However, she didn’t do anything at all.  She had acquired a skill called the Fragment of jealousy.  This was a passive skill that stimulated jealousy and bonus money was put into the eyes and appraisal. Does it mean she was jealous of people?  Juanaverta’s emotions flowed that strong.  I was prepared for it, but as I thought, the effect was minimal, so I don’t think it would work at all. At the very least, I didn’t feel like I was jealous so far.  </p>
<p>『Also, there are some things that have changed from eating the cross-shaped magic sword, so it’s hard to tell which one is the result of which cannibalize it is.』</p>
<p>  My attack power increased by 110 to 1612 after absorbing Overgrowth. It wasn’t much for me to gain the power of the cross-shaped magic sword and the bearer of hope, Juanaverta.  Overgrowth had gone up by 150 with just one swing. No, Overgrowth had been buffed considerably, and maybe that was what made it so special?  My mana increased by +5,000, and my durability increased by about +700.  That alone was a lot.  I’m really grateful to have that much.  In terms of numbers, I’d already been at the level where a divine sword before it was released would be an opponent. Well, it was because I had devoured the Discarded Divine Sword. Unfortunately, its conductivity hasn’t increased.  It’s still an SS though. And it was the most important skill I could use... </p>
<p>『Usually, except for a few pieces of jealousy, there’s more and more ways for me to process and devote myself to work』</p>
<p>  Processing was a skill that allowed you to think of multiple things at the same time, and it seemed to be a sub-comparison of simultaneous operations. Maybe it was from Juanaverta, huh?  I’ve heard that she was a calm person before I got the original sin of jealousy.  Aah, but it might also contain the power of a bearer of hope. I’ve heard that she’s a person similar to Announcer-san.  Devourer is a little strange.  As long as I’m thinking about someone, I can get the energy to work for them.  That’s what it’s like.  So, in my case, I’m going to get a bonus when I fight for Fran’s sake? Well, it doesn’t seem to be a bad skill.  Also, the level of my ice and snow skill has increased from 1 to 3.  It was probably the result of my cannibalizing of Juanaverta, the wielder of ice and snow magic. </p>
<p>『So, this is probably the result of taking in Ebiruta’s abilities』</p>
<p>  The golden skill had changed to a golden skill.  It seemed that I could charge the magic power of the defeated antidemons into my blade for a while while while, while retaining the power of my antidemon’s special effect. I slashed antidemons to absorb their magic power, and then used that power to fight more antidemons.  It was just a skill to fight antidemons. To be honest, I’m about to leave this continent soon, so there aren’t many opportunities to play an active role in this though.  </p>
<p>『And then, there’s the end of it, huh...』</p>
<p>  The Evil Spirit Control and the Evil Spirit Torpedo disappeared, and a new skill called “Evil Spirit Conquest” had been added. This was probably the result of the cannibalizing of the falldown.  Skills that affected Evil Spirits had been integrated into it.  The effect was to manipulate Evil Spirits, amplify Evil Spirits, eliminate the influence from Evil Spirits, and finally communicate with the Evil God. It seemed to be a good idea to think of it as a higher level version of the Evil Spirit-type skills we’ve had so far.  Oh, all that was left was the name. The status was clearly marked as “Human Sword, Master”.  </p>
<p>『Don’t give a shit...  It’s so shitty after all!』</p>
<p> I thought about it when it changed, but there was something else to it!  </p>
<p>(Not that, it’s very cool)</p>
<p>『... Really?』</p>
<p>(Nn!  It’s perfect for Master, who is both a sword and a person!  Very cool)</p>
<p>『R-really?』</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
<p> I’m Fran’s sword at the same time as I am myself. I have to respect her will as well. </p>
<p>(It suits me as well as Master, a cool sword that transcends extreme strength)</p>
<p>『... I-is that so?』</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
<p>I thought about it when I changed my mind, but there must be something else to it! </p>
<p>(Not that, it’s very cool)</p>
<p>『...Really?』</p>
<p>(Nn! It suits Master, who is both a sword and a person! Very cool)</p>
<p>『I-is that really what you think?』</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
<p>I’m not only myself, but also Fran’s sword. I have to respect her will. </p>
<p>(It suits me as well as Master, a cool sword that transcends extreme strength)</p>
<p>『...I-is that so?』</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
<p> As long as Fran is happy with this name, that’s all I need to do.</p>
