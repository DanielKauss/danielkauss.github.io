</div><h1>Chapter 1014</h1><p>Meritte reached for the neck of the giant antidemon, in which she held a cross-shaped magic sword.</p>
<p>「Ahahaha! I’ll get rid of all the yokes that bind you!」</p>
<p>I wondered if she was planning to control the antidemons, but apparently not.</p>
<p>I could feel a magical connection between the antidemons and Meritte through the cross-shaped magic sword. They seemed to be in sync with each other, with their magic power mixed in at once.</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>『Oi oi...!』</p>
<p>Both Fran and I were surprised and stiffened. We were that surprised.</p>
<p>Much to our surprise, Merritte’s body sank into the giant antidemon. But it was not just a matter of getting inside it. It was clearly assimilating.</p>
<p>Even though his body was mixed with the blood and flesh of the antidemons, Meritte was still laughing.</p>
<p>「I’m not! If we can’t be happy! There’s no value in existence in such a world!」</p>
<p>I could feel the despair and anger that had cursed everything in the world from Meritte’s blood spitting shout. She said she was going to destroy the dragonkin, but now that the hatred seemed to have spread beyond that.</p>
<p>「I’ll break the restrictions that keep you trapped! I’ll give you everything I’ve got! My body, soul, and heart! All of it! So――So just destroy everything!」</p>
<p>Leaving those cursed words behind, Meritte and his crushered magic sword disappeared completely into the body of the giant antidemon.</p>
<p>Immediately after, the antidemons, who had originally been radiating tremendous power, began to give off an even more vicious aura.</p>
<p>Apparently, magic power was coming from somewhere. Where was this magic coming from? It looked as if magic power was coming from nothing and was pouring into the giant antidemons.</p>
<p>『I see! The Abyss Eater huh!?』</p>
<p>It seems that the Abyss Eater, which was filled with wards on this continent, was sending magic power to that giant antidemon. I guess that means it already has magic power close to infinity...</p>
<p>When he showed up, I certainly thought he was strong, but it didn’t feel like he was the strongest. However, I realized it was a mistake to see how he accumulates magic power and becomes stronger.</p>
<p>They were already clad in magic so dense that it caused a storm in the surrounding area, and the intimidation they radiated was perfect. If they were to get more magic power, they would really be unable to handle it.</p>
<p>What should we do?</p>
<p>If we were to provoke him into a fight, we wouldn’t be able to deal with him on our own. The first thing we would do would be to escape.</p>
<p>(Master, what about Isario?)</p>
<p>『To be honest, I don’t know』</p>
<p>The presence of an antidemon was too great. I would have to say the Divine Sword Released state, otherwise it would have been quite difficult to find Isario alone.</p>
<p>I don’t think Isario would easily die from this. But the fact that Meritte was completely unrestricted like this......</p>
<p>「Uuaaaaaaaaaaah!」</p>
<p>「It’s starting to move」</p>
<p>『Let’s get some distance!』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Immediately after Fran jumped back, the antidemon’s huge right fist was thrust into the place where it had been before. There were even about small houses in the fist alone.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what the giant antidemons were capable of.</p>
<p>A single impact caused the earth to collapse and a huge explosion ensued, ruffling the surroundings. Fran, who was supposed to be several meters away, was blown away by the strong wind.</p>
<p>Fran regained her stance in the air and ran further into the sky toward the outside of the barrier. There, she found her left arm extended. Her movements were ridiculously fast. This is bad!</p>
<p>『Fran! Behind her!』</p>
<p>「...!」</p>
<p>Fran kicked in the air and avoided the huge palm of her hand in the nick of time. The tip of her finger was only slightly grazed by the barrier, and Fran was flicked away with tremendous force.</p>
<p>『Fran! I’ll heal you, so don’t stop!』</p>
<p>「O-Okay!」</p>
<p>She spat lightly blood, as if the impact had damaged the inside of the barrier.</p>
<p>Still, without stopping, Fran succeeded in escaping from the giant antidemons by using the momentum she was blown away. She made her way out of the barrier that surrounded the castle, but she tilted her head in confusion.</p>
<p>『Fran, what’s wrong?』</p>
<p>「...My power, may have been sucked?」</p>
<p>『What?』</p>
<p>I don’t feel anything, do I? But when I observed Fran, it was not a mistake. I didn’t notice it since it was really little, but Fran’s magic and life force were sucking out of her.</p>
<p>For Fran, who has a high self-healing ability, this was probably only a margin of error. But for a normal person, this might be quite dangerous.</p>
<p>It was absorbed by a giant antidemon. Maybe it could steal power from others even if it was already sourced from the Abyss Eater.</p>
<p>「It getting bigger」</p>
<p>『What? No, no, certainly...!』</p>
<p>They don’t seem to have excess magic power gained, but they seemed to have grown even more. So, isn’t it really dangerous to let this continue?</p>
<p>Realizing that, Fran ran away without even looking back.</p>
<p>We went down a hill and passed through the barrier of the castle. However, an antidemon that had grown even larger was chasing after us. The distance between us was quickly reduced because of its tremendous range of steps.</p>
<p>Wait, the antidemons in this castle won’t be able to get out of the barrier......? Or did we just say that they won’t be able to get out of the basement in the first place?</p>
<p>「Aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!」</p>
<p>『This is bad!』</p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>Just as the antidemon’s chest swelled for a moment, a tremendous booming voice was emitted. In addition to the physical shockwave, the compressed magic power raged wildly, blowing us to pieces.</p>
<p>Thanks to the barrier, there was almost no damage, and Fran immediately regained her stance. However, with that slight sniffing, the giant antidemon was rapidly approaching.</p>
<p>I noticed that the antidemon’s huge arm was already closing in on me. This would be very difficult to evade.</p>
<p>I tried to put up a barrier again to reduce the damage even a little. It’s not perfect because it was just after it was destroyed, but it’s better than nothing.</p>
<p>『Damn!』</p>
<p>「Recoil?!」</p>
<p>However, just before the direct hit, a pale blue wall suddenly appeared between Fran and her huge arms.</p>
<p>Moreover, they held back the giant antidemon’s arm slightly. For a brief moment, it was enough for Fran to escape.</p>
<p>「That was...」</p>
<p>「Looks like we made it just in time」</p>
<p>「Seliadot, silence.」</p>
<p>As we turned around, we saw a blonde girl standing a little further away.</p>
