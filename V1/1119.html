</div><h1>Chapter 1119</h1><p>After the self-introduction, Mareficent called out to the brave soldiers in the square.</p>
<p>「Yes yes! Everyone! Please gather here! I’d like to introduce you to the captain of this unit.」</p>
<p>Perhaps knowing that she was a Rank A adventurer, the warriors in the square gradually started gathering. However, they looked very slow, just like a blunder.</p>
<p>And yet, Mareficent and the others just stared at them smiling.</p>
<p>「Yeah, I’m only hired to guide you on a basic level. So, in the future, Black Lightning Princess-dono will be the one to give you instructions as the commander, right? The same goes for Persona?」</p>
<p>「Guide only?」</p>
<p>「You have a Rank A adventurer, but Fran is treated as superior?」</p>
<p>「I really like heroes. I want to collect stories about heroes, talk to them, and see what they do with my own eyes. And the most exciting new hero on this continent is the Black Cat Kin’s savior and adventurer, Black Lightning Princess-dono! Well, if you can work for her, I’ve also received a dumb request to show her how to be a brave soldier!」</p>
<p>「...So what do you mean?」</p>
<p>「We’re a fan of yours, so I’d like to see it up close! But we’re so busy observing that we don’t have to fight! Well, you can do some chores if you’re okay with it, okay?」</p>
<p>In other words, she wanted to get closer to Fran and accepted the role of guide. Come on, it’s just the mentality of the fanbase? Don’t you feel any impure feelings like “Fran-chan, so cute!” or something like that?</p>
<p>But if I show the slightest strange presence, it’ll get my tip stuck in his butt!</p>
<p>(Master?)</p>
<p>『......For now, Fran is saying that she should be the commander.』</p>
<p>「Okay, I’m the captain」</p>
<p>「Of course! Captain Fran!」</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>A frivolous maleficent and a persona clapping silently. Are they really okay?</p>
<p>Mareficent then explained to the adventurers who had finally gathered.</p>
<p>「Sigh. This is Fran-dono, the captain of the unit. Applause.」</p>
<p>I heard a lot of applause from the people around us, but most of them stared at Fran as if to try to put a value on her. This was not hostile, but it seemed that they didn’t recognize her.</p>
<p>「Well then, please take good care of the rest, okay?」</p>
<p>「Nn. I’m Fran, a B-ranked adventurer. The captain of this fleet」</p>
<p>「Oi oi, Rank B? That little girl is...?」</p>
<p>「You’ve heard some rumors, haven’t you?」</p>
<p>「Isn’t this kid the captain?」</p>
<p>There was hardly anything in particular about the whispers of the adventurers who started making a scene. They were filled with surprise, jealousy, and contempt. I never thought that this would happen in the future, but...</p>
<p>However, no one suddenly went on a rampage. They were probably fighting B-ranked adventurers, after all. Besides, it was not a good idea to make a scene here to join as a valiant soldier. They seemed to truly understand that.</p>
<p>As a result, his rebelliousness and patience clashed, and he became just like a normal person for the time being. There was also the influence of Urushi, who could use his glaring at her behind Fran.</p>
<p>They looked down at the adventurers with fear, as if the first one was the most important. The size of the room was a little bigger, so it was very impressive.</p>
<p>『Well then, let’s see what happens from here』</p>
<p>We already had supplies for six carriages. We had suggested that we should stow them in storage and carry them, but Klimt had told us that he wanted to train our valiant soldiers in guarding and transporting them.</p>
<p>It seems that although these warriors were capable, they were judged unable to be part of a normal unit due to various reasons, such as poor behavior and the fear of being completely committed due to resentment.</p>
<p>Aside from those who had a desire for revenge against Raidos, why would bad behavior adventurers volunteer for war? It was because of their bad behavior.</p>
<p>The Adventurer’s Guild doesn’t force anyone to participate in wars, but it mediates requests from the government to participate. As a result, some people are willing to participate in wars and gain rewards or the guild’s contribution.</p>
<p>It seemed that even those with a bad reputation, who usually couldn’t accept legitimate requests, could become volunteer soldiers. The government could not afford to choose what to do.</p>
<p>Some of them were also plotting to plunder the enemy’s country. It was a breach of military orders, but some of their commanders would let them off the hook.</p>
<p>It was certain that they would lose their footing even if they were to join a normal unit, but it would be a shame to let them have fun because they already had a good fighting ability.</p>
<p>As a result, they were planned to be given a small number of missions to transport supplies. However, would it be possible for children with problems specializing in combat ability to perform plain transportation missions seriously?</p>
<p>When I said bad behavior, it reminded me of Krad and the others who had once gone into the dungeon with us, but they were just bad attitudes and the mission was quite serious. I guess the ones in this unit were even worse. To put it more bluntly, they were simply scum.</p>
<p>It was quite far from Persona, so I tried appraising it as a trial, but it was possible. Then, I didn’t see any criminal skills or titles coming out, such as threats, theft, fraud, etc.</p>
<p>Naturally, the guild and the country must have been concerned about their behavior. They decided to let them carry out the transportation mission in advance.</p>
<p>That was their mission this time. I’m sure Mareficent was the one who was in charge of appraising the adventurers.</p>
<p>She should look at their attitude during the mission and how serious they were. The main goal was to find out if they were reliable enough to assign their mission in the future.</p>
<p>They also allowed Fran to destroy any enemies if they attacked them. In a sense, this was meant to expose the underworld soldiers to the enemy too.</p>
<p>Now that they’ve told us their internal situation, Fran must be on the watch side, right? They shouldn’t be treated as bad behavior.</p>
<p>We left the carriage to someone with experience as a coachman, and the others divided into eight or nine people and ordered them to escort each carriage.</p>
<p>Several of them were a little behind in their departure because they told us to let the driver go, but they ignored us and walked away dissatisfiedly. As I thought, they would have a problem with abandoning us on the way to the mission.</p>
<p>The march was also very slow. Every time a magic beast showed up, the adventurers went to defeat it. Even when they were told to leave the small fry magic beast behind, they did not listen to Fran’s rumors that it was to protect the supplies. It was clearly to make money.</p>
<p>After all, if there were less than a hundred people, the effect of the March of the Valkyrie wouldn’t work.</p>
<p>In the end, only about 60 per cent of the planned time could go on the first day, and we ended up entering the camp. I could understand the hardships Cruz had on the way to the Spider’s Web dungeon.</p>
<p>Moreover, the camp could not be quiet either. They were stealing their food, they didn’t like the way the guards looked after them, they didn’t want the girls to tell them to leave early, and they were causing a commotion here.</p>
<p>The one who attacked Fran forced her to go to bed with his fists, but Fran was frustrated all day long.</p>
<p>『Fran, are you okay?』</p>
<p>(Why are they so annoying?)</p>
<p>『Well, he’s not the type to always follow people after all』</p>
<p>Mareficent just sat quietly without saying anything to herself, but at this rate, she would be disqualified from more than half of them, I guess?</p>
<p>I mean, I’m worried that Fran might be a little disappointed and the number of troops might decrease a little. I have to be more careful now.</p>
