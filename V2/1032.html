</div><h1>Chapter 1032</h1><p>Trismegistus held up Franaverta while saying that he was going to give him a reward. Fran was taken aback, but she didn’t suddenly slash at him. </p>
<p>「Fran, </p>
<p>『Get ready』</p>
<p>「!!Another spirit?!」</p>
<p> Fran, who was originally wary of Trismegistus, took a clear defensive stance with that spirit. Perhaps the effect would be weak when the current Fran was hit by a “Let’s lie down” kind of words. It was the same as when the “Don’t move” order against me only worked for a moment.” kind of words, but the effect would be rather weak.  It was the same as the “Don’t move” order against me that did not work for just a moment.  But what if the order was for her to do what she was trying to do more?But what if they ordered us to do something better than what we were trying to do?  Even someone as strong as Fran might be able to follow the orders of the spirits.  Both Fran and I were puzzled by what Trismegistus was trying to do.  But the same went for the Juanaverta that Trismegistus was setting up.  </p>
<p>『O Lord, what are you gonna do?』</p>
<p>「I’m gonna have Fran and Urushi reward you.」</p>
<p>『What do you mean......?』</p>
<p> It seems that even Juanaverta could not grasp the meaning of Trismegistus’ actions.  Trismegistus raised his head while avoiding any further talk. I couldn’t sense any killing intent, but it was only natural in this case.  </p>
<p>「Juanaverta, you.  The transformation of your mind due to the original sin of jealousy has progressed too. The harm of your presence is already outweighing the benefit of your presence.」</p>
<p>『W-What is it...?  I-I will sacrifice myself for you――』</p>
<p>「Indeed. I call you my true loyal servant, but I don’t need you anymore」</p>
<p>『Trismegistus-sama!  Wait!』</p>
<p>  What suddenly began? Arguments, or rather, lament......  Trismegistus did not stop moving and slash at Fran with his quick blade.  </p>
<p>『H-Hey, unnecessary? Lord!?』</p>
<p>「Fran, </p>
<p>『Just take it』</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p> Another one. Seeing Fran like that, it was Juanaverta who shouted in panic.  </p>
<p>『Trismegistus-sama!  Magic power on the blade!  Please! At this rate――』</p>
<p>「Juanaverta. It has been loyal and well-behaved up until now.」</p>
<p>  Trismegistus, who had Swordking Mastery, knew how to wield his sword, was less taxing and more efficient. Snap. I heard a light sound and Juanaverta’s blade cut in half from the middle. </p>
<p>『Gyaaaaaaaaaaahhh!』</p>
<p>『Uoooooooh!?』</p>
<p> The Cannibalism skill was activated and Juanaverta’s power flowed into the air.  </p>
<p>《Instability of the Cannibalism skill activated.  Urgent activation.》</p>
<p>『A-Announcer-san......』</p>
<p>《Aberrations are detected to exceed expectations.  Most of the output is cut off.  The internal work is temporarily suspended and the power is concentrated on control. The days until the restart is unknown.》</p>
<p>  So, you’re saying that Announcer-san is going to be the one to take care of the power obtained from this cannibalism? In the meantime, she won’t be able to talk to us again, and she won’t know when the resurrection will be.  </p>
<p>『I’m sorry again.』</p>
<p>《Sorry, Master.  I’m fine. May you all have the blessings of the God of Wisdom...》</p>
<p>  She fell asleep, huh?  I was so reliable every time I slept... But thanks to Announcer-san, the torrent of power that I couldn’t control had weakened, and I managed to suppress it even by myself.  However, even when the overflowing magic power subsided, something else that was bothering me had not changed at all. Not only my power, but also Franaverta’s emotions flowed in with me.  Announcer-san also said that it was difficult to interfere with my emotions. A variety of negative emotions that Franaverta had pushed inside me are swirling intensely. The sadness of not being able to work for the Lord, the anger and jealousy I felt as a cut, and the Lord’s uneasiness for the future.  However, there was no dissatisfaction or anger at Trismegistus, who had destroyed me. I had gone crazy because of the original sin of jealousy, but my loyalty to the Lord was real.  That was why I felt so sorry for him.  I looked at Trismegistus, panting under the enormous burden of attacking me because of my cannibalism. I was glad if I could feel the sadness in even a small part of him. This swirling emotion that I couldn’t understand myself would be over.  However, Trismegistus’ face was still showing no signs of emotion. It seemed that he no longer had a humanity that made him feel sad.  When I thought about it, both Trismegistus and Juanaverta looked pitiful. I thought it was a hateful enemy, but why?  No, I know.  I’m sure they were unconsciously comparing me and Fran.  What if they become the same too? Will Fran not abandon me?  I’m sure she won’t abandon me.  But if it was a burden for Fran, I want her to abandon it.  Rather, should she let herself die? Yes, I am――  A tremendous amount of negative thoughts run through my mind.  I was being led by Juanaverta’s emotions.An indescribable negative thought ran through my head, driven by Juanaverta’s emotions.  I knew this, but I couldn’t switch my mood.  </p>
<p>「Master?  Are you okay?  I’m fine.  I’m following you」</p>
<p>『Yeah...』</p>
<p>  It was strange.  The moment I heard Fran’s voice, all my negative emotions disappeared――― I felt like they weren’t gone.  But it didn’t bother me.  </p>
<p>『Don’t worry, I’m the one』</p>
<p>「?  Naturally.  Master is Master. He’s my Master and my partner」</p>
<p>『Haha, you’re right』</p>
<p>  Fran was the best partner I could be.  So, she would never make Fran sad, wouldn’t she?</p>
<p>「Master? You okay? I’m fine, I’m still following you」</p>
<p>『Aah...』</p>
<p> It was strange. The moment I heard Fran’s voice, all my negative emotions disappeared――I felt them. They hadn’t disappeared. But I didn’t bother with it. </p>
<p>『Don’t worry, I’m still with you』</p>
<p>「? Naturally. Master is Master. He’s my Master and my partner」</p>
<p>『Haha, you’re right』</p>
<p> Fran was the best partner I could be. So, she would never make Fran sad, wouldn’t she? I’m not going crazy at all.</p>
