</div><h1>Chapter 1138</h1><p>After a few seconds of blocking the super fireballs released from the fort, the surrounding situation had been completely transformed. Smoke and sunlight still rose from all over the burned plains, and countless black objects that were human were scattered around. The heat was probably not enough to make ashes, but it was even more miserable to leave a human form behind. I guess hell was just such a scene. The adventurers were stunned, silent in the face of this miserable sight. The adventurers were stunned, silent in the face of this miserable sight.  The army of the nobles who had escaped was annihilated. They were burned evenly from top to bottom.  Almost 5,000 people were killed in just one attack.  On the other hand, about half of the nobles and knights who had started to retreat with the adventurers were still alive.  Well, many of them were half-dead from the heatwave burns. Even if the flames didn’t reach them directly, the entire body was burned from the heat, and their throats were swollen and blocked by the burns.  </p>
<p>「Muh...」</p>
<p>「Donad?」</p>
<p>「I’m trying to expand the range of my skills, but it’s not going to end well!」</p>
<p>  It seemed that they were trying to use the brilliance of the guardians on the soldiers and knights who had survived, but they failed. The light was still shining brightly, but it was very weak to the strong light that surrounded the adventurers.  It seemed that the recovery effect was not very strong.  That would only prolong their lives for a little while. It seems that it wasn’t just that they purposely protected the adventurers, but that their skills only work on adventurers.  Why? There’s no skill that only those registered to the Adventurers Guild can use, right?  Besides, some knights and soldiers from the nobles were enveloped in that white light.  Come to think of it, when we first arrived at the battlefield, they weren’t enveloped in that white light, right? Later, when we started fighting together with the adventurers, before we knew it, we had been able to reap the benefit of the guardian’s radiance.  There must be some sort of disconnection between them.  </p>
<p>『Hmm...?』</p>
<p>(Master?)</p>
<p>『Donad’s white light. What do you think is the difference between a person who doesn’t have that effect and someone who doesn’t?』</p>
<p>(That’s simple)</p>
<p>『Eh? Fran, do you know?』</p>
<p>(Nn.  Whether you think of Donad as a boss or not.)</p>
<p>『Aah―!  I see!』</p>
<p>  Now that you mention it, that may be true.  It must be similar to Fran’s “March of the Valkyrie”. Maybe the key was that she felt that Donadrond was under her command and accepted it. The reason why it only works on a part of the knights and soldiers is probably because she has a different opinion inside her.  However, a slight prolongation of life would be enough for Mareficent. The super-wide recovery magic was activated by the adventurers in the mask who had perfected the technique in that time.  </p>
<p>「Wide-Range Maximum Heal!」</p>
<p>  A gentle light enveloped the battlefield. The dying ones were breathing back with the use of a wide-area Maximum Heal.  To think that healing was even possible!  Mareficent can really do anything. Does he have any special skills like mine that allow him to gather skills?  He had so many skills that I wouldn’t be surprised if he didn’t.  As I was observing Mareficent while healing the soldiers, Avengers and the others suddenly came running toward him. And then, they deployed a barrier in the direction of the fort. </p>
<p>「Nuoooh!」</p>
<p>「I’m going to protect the priestess!」</p>
<p>  For a moment, we didn’t understand what she was doing, but soon Fran and I took similar actions.  A flash of red light.  Immediately after we saw the light, two ghouls had vaporized their entire barriers. The side of Avenger behind her was also gouged in a circle, creating a tremendous impact on our barrier.  It was a sniper shot from the fort.  It was a laser-like flame that was aimed at us. It was too fast, and if Avenger and the others hadn’t protected us, we might have been in trouble.  </p>
<p>「Attack from the fort! Everyone get farther away!」</p>
<p>「Just like Fran said! Get some more distance!」</p>
<p>  This is really a nuisance!  Red Knights!  Snipes rained down from the fort to drive the Kranzel army away.  Although weaker than a single sniper shot at Fran, it was enough to kill nobles, knights, and soldiers. Many of them have already lost their lives. We and Donadrond tried to block their attacks, but we’re often too late.  Moreover, the undead often spring up again. The super fire spheres from the fort seemed to have annihilated the undead, but skeletons suddenly appeared and began to attack the Kranzel army.  They were soldiers who had been burned to death by the super fire spheres.  They were resurrected by necromancy and turned into skeletons. The tremendous flames had charred their flesh, but their bones were probably still alive and kicking.  And troublesomely, the undead also seemed to have attacked us from the retreat direction. There were not many of them, however, were super-powerful undead knights in red armor.  Yes, they were the undead of the red knights that had been defeated by Forrund.  I only stored Ionez’s corpses, but the red knight’s corpses were still intact. They had been resurrected as high-ranking undead, Durahan, and before I knew it, they had been on our side.  They had been completely sandwiched from the front and rear.  Moreover, the attacks from the fort were ongoing.  It might be difficult to retreat at this rate.  As the undead attacked us and the number of casualties increased, they would become our enemies as well. As time goes by, we were at a disadvantage.  Jean was scared of us on the battlefield.  </p>
<p>『It’s gonna be difficult to eliminate the undead completely......』</p>
<p>(Then we’ll eliminate the main cause!)</p>
<p>『Hmm.</p>
<p>『Hmmm.</p>
<p>『Hmmm. I guess that’s it』</p>
