</div><h1>Chapter 1123</h1><p>He then pointed to two of the paths on the map that Murphysent had come out of and explained them to us.</p>
<p>「The route we took is longer, but it’s flat and unlikely to encounter enemy scouts. On the other hand, the route is quite short, but I’m still a little worried.」</p>
<p>「Are you worried?」</p>
<p>「This road is a route over the mountains, but a part of it is still within the realm of Raidos’ influence」</p>
<p>The Kranzel Kingdom extended much of their influence within the Raidos Kingdom, but they had only slightly cut off the borderline area. It seemed to be mottled by the mixture of their dominant territory and the untouched area.</p>
<p>And that was not the only concern.</p>
<p>「There used to be a stronghold along this way where Evil God admirers gathered」</p>
<p>There was apparently a fort near the border with Kranzel in the south of the Eastern Duke’s mansion where Evil God’s admirers gathered.</p>
<p>「My name is Miranleil Fort」</p>
<p>I’ve heard of it somewhere before, right?</p>
<p>「It was the location of the largest group of Evil God admirers in the world, located in Raydoss, but it was destroyed by someone」</p>
<p>After that, I remembered when I heard Mareficent’s explanation.</p>
<p>This must have been the location of their base, which had been destroyed by Zelos Reed.</p>
<p>「I’ve heard of it.」</p>
<p>「Oh, I see. Well, it was a famous story on this continent after all」</p>
<p>Certainly, it would be a very dangerous place to go since this was a den of evil god admirers. If someone as powerful as Linford and Zelos Reed were to be there, the stepfathers might be in some serious trouble.</p>
<p>Well, that would happen if the Evil God admirers were still here.</p>
<p>「It actually hasn’t died?」</p>
<p>「No, it seems the Evil God’s admirers have disappeared, making it look like there are no people in there」</p>
<p>「......But why do you think it’s dangerous?」</p>
<p>「Now then, Miranleil fort and her guardian of the Evil Gods. Don’t you think it’s a little strange after hearing this information?」</p>
<p>「How did the Evil God’s admirer get that fort?」</p>
<p>「Of course, that’s strange too」</p>
<p>Come to think of it, that was certainly strange.</p>
<p>It seemed to be a rather large fort, but would the Raidos Kingdom be left to the Evil God’s admirers? Wouldn’t the red knights normally make a move?</p>
<p>Or maybe it was some kind of fortress built by the Evil God’s admirers on their own? No, if at all possible, it wouldn’t be a reason for the red knights to leave them there. It would be strange for them to be used as a base for evil spirits for such a long period of time that there were even rumors on the continent.</p>
<p>But that was not the only strange part about it.</p>
<p>「Well, a lot of information has been released about the Kingdom of Raidos before and after this war. But did you have any information on them before?」</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>「Did you not have any information on the Kingdom of Raidos? In fact, the inner workings of the Kingdom of Raidos were obsessed and leaked almost no information to the outside world. Why was the information on the Kingdom of Miranleil’s fortification spreading among the Raidos Kingdom, which was concerned about such security?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, sure.」</p>
<p>That’s right! Certainly! It’s strange when an ordinary adventurer says the name of Miranleil Fort!</p>
<p>At that time, I heard that Zelos Reed had destroyed her, and I could only wonder if there was such a place...</p>
<p>It would be strange if the story of the destruction of a fort where Evil God admirers gathered was sent to the Kingdom of Kranzel in the first place. The other information was completely blocked, but why would the story only spread?</p>
<p>It was as if all of that information had been intentionally scattered. There was a possibility that the rumors had spread among the Evil God’s followers who had escaped, but... It seemed that there was a possibility that the rumors had been spread intentionally.</p>
<p>Could it be that the Eastern Duke was connected to the Evil God admirer? And for some reason, he spread the word about the Evil God admirer?</p>
<p>I guess that’s what Mareficent was thinking too, so she was wondering if she should take the route through the vicinity.</p>
<p>(Master, what should we do?)</p>
<p>『If we were alone, we might have been able to scout them out, but we were in the middle of a request this time. Let’s take some safety measures』</p>
<p>「Nn. Got it. I’ll use the safe route this time」</p>
<p>「Understood, let’s use that one then. Will you train like today again tomorrow?」</p>
<p>「Of course not.」</p>
<p>「Well, if we’re gonna keep running all day, we’ll make up for the first day’s delay.」</p>
<p>Tomorrow, the start-up camp would be continued all day long.</p>
<p>After only explaining that, the two then left.</p>
<p>She said she loved heroes, and we were prepared to be asked more about them...... However, it seemed that this was not something she wasn’t interested in, and both Mareficent and Persona were glancing at us.</p>
<p>He seemed to be hesitant about doing his job. Even though he was an A-ranked adventurer, that was pretty common sense around here.</p>
<p>The next day.</p>
<p>『Today is the day we’ll go to that tower.』</p>
<p>She must have been filled with so much fear that even a day passed. Well, how could that tragedy be forgotten in just one night?</p>
<p>Fran’s voice rang out from the morning.</p>
<p>「Men below the goblins. Run faster and more happily!」</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>「Answer!」</p>
<p>「「「「Yes! Captain!」」」」</p>
<p>Yeah. Fran’s Bootcamp was going well. I rarely gave her any advice, but she was really a sergeant right?</p>
<p>While I was impressed, Fran continued to speak to the valiant soldiers.</p>
<p>「I’ll tell you the magic words.」</p>
<p>Magic Words?</p>
<p>「After you answer, I’ll put curry on!」</p>
<p>「「「?」」」</p>
<p>『?』</p>
<p>「What’s your answer?」</p>
<p>「「「「Yes, Captain! Curry!」」」」</p>
<p>「Nn. That’s fine」</p>
<p>This is bad! Something like giving a sergeant a beating? No, I really didn’t teach her anything! But does that mean the sergeant’s talent that resided inside Fran has blossomed?</p>
<p>「I’ll serve you curry today too. But if you imagine that and shout “Curry”, you’ll be fine!」</p>
<p>「「「「Yes, Captain! Curry!」」」」</p>
