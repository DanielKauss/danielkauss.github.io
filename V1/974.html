</div><h1>Chapter 974</h1><p>The giant-type stared back at us with an angry expression.</p>
<p>Until now, the only person who seemed to have emotions was the commander. But I guess the giant-type, which existed even more than that, naturally had its own emotions.</p>
<p>「Ruaaaaah!」</p>
<p>『You remember one idiot huh!?』</p>
<p>The giant-type crouched down again to pick up the rubble. But this time, it was not exactly the same as before. To my surprise, it was able to grab the rubble with its left and right hands.</p>
<p>The giant-type stood up with great force in front of our astonished eyes, waving both hands at the same time.</p>
<p>「I’ll take them down.」</p>
<p>The giant-type twisted its face as if it was grinning and began to swing only its left arm.</p>
<p>『Did you plan to throw two shots in a row because of the time difference!?』</p>
<p>(Master, what should we do?)</p>
<p>『Throw me up! All I have to do is lower Fran a little and store only those who hit everyone directly』</p>
<p>(Got it!)</p>
<p>Fran twisted her body as hard as she could and threw me at the left arm of the giant form of a side throw. She accelerated super-accelerating with skills and magic, but it still didn’t do much damage. However, our main purpose was to close the distance.</p>
<p>This is because the closer they are, the more powerful the telekinesis would be.</p>
<p>『Let’s use telekinesis first!』</p>
<p>I activated my telekinesis just like before to block the throwing of the giant dragonkin. The rock that was thrown by the giant dragonkin of Shallus fell at his feet again.</p>
<p>But this was not the end of the giant-type attack. He used the momentum of his left arm to twist his body, and then used the momentum to swing down his right arm even more forcefully.</p>
<p>『I’m not going to use high-level skills』</p>
<p>『Self-destruct!』</p>
<p>「Rooooooooooooogh!」</p>
<p>She then read the trajectory of the giant’s hand and opened a Dimension Gate in front of it. With its movements similar to that of a human, it was not difficult to predict.</p>
<p>With the full use of my Wizard Skill and the blessing of the Goddess of Wisdom, I created the largest gate I could make now. It was probably over ten meters in diameter.</p>
<p>Even so, some of them had escaped through the space-time gates, but most of them succeeded in swallowing them at the gate.</p>
<p>I was close to where that gate was created. After all, it was right behind it.</p>
<p>Countless pieces of rubble then lunged out from the gate at the back of the giant.</p>
<p>「Ruuuuuuuuu!」</p>
<p>『Crap!』</p>
<p>「Ruaaagh......!」</p>
<p>Even if they had a strong body, they would take damage if they were to take that powerful attack. A large number of rocks were thrust into their backs, and magic power was leaking out of it.</p>
<p>He may not be seriously injured, but he seemed to be confused by the incomprehensible situation. He was clearly paying attention to what was behind it.</p>
<p>With this attack and defense, I perfectly grasped the timing of opening the Dimension Gate. Next time, I’ll make a gate even closer and give it back to them all.</p>
<p>That’s what I was thinking as I watched the giant-type crouching down again. But the giant-types rarely got up.</p>
<p>『Yeah. What are you doing while you’re still sitting――?』</p>
<p>「Ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh!」</p>
<p>『Wha!?』</p>
<p>With a deafening crash, a tremendous torrent of magic power blew the surroundings away. I was safe because I had put up a barrier, but the area around the giant-type was like a crater.</p>
<p>I quickly looked up and saw that the body of a giant had jumped upwards. It wasn’t that it was picking up the rubble, but that it had bent its legs to accumulate muscle power and mana.</p>
<p>By using the power of that huge body combined with the momentum of her magic release, she was able to make a surprising jump.</p>
<p>He decided that throwing was not working and switched to direct attack. The more annoying he was, the faster he switched!</p>
<p>Over 200 meters high, it was a super huge body. A huge shadow slowly licked the ground and blocked the sunlight above the head of the second unit.</p>
<p>That position was dangerous!</p>
<p>『Uwooooh!』</p>
<p>I quickly teleported behind the giant and hit it with my wind magic. I was trying to somehow divert its trajectory.</p>
<p>However, they were not very effective against the giant types that were protected by a magic barrier. However, there was no way that those on the ground would do anything.</p>
<p>The zone of flames, reminiscent of a dragon’s exhalation, had been released into the air of the giant type. Isario’s attacks must have been unable to withstand even that giant type.</p>
<p>The giant-type, whose left arm was burned as a shield, lost its balance in the air and diverted from its original trajectory. It would surely fall off at a certain distance from us.</p>
<p>However, the giant-type antidemons still struggled when he died.</p>
<p>Immediately after it fell from its stomach, it desperately swung down its right arm toward the second unit. The earth shook from the impact of the giant-type fall, so the second unit could not escape as quickly as they could.</p>
<p>His arm, which looked like a high-rise building, was barely reaching the second unit. I could see his palms larger than those of a heavytruck, crushing part of the second unit.</p>
<p>「Guys!」</p>
<p>『Shiit!』</p>
<p>We hurriedly returned to the bottom of the second unit, and gnashed at the extent of the damage.</p>
<p>More than 50 people, including the adventurers and the old soldiers of the Kingdom of Hagane, would have lost their lives. There should be about as many injured as any of them.</p>
<p>『I’m gonna heal Fran!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Fran instructed them to hurry away while healing the soldiers. If things continued like this, the giants who were trying to get up might cause more damage.</p>
<p>Immediately after, I saw a red light rising from the side of the giant who had raised his body using his right arm.</p>
<p>Isario.</p>
<p>I thought she had released the Divine Sword, but that didn’t seem to be the case. It seemed that she released so much magic power to draw the attention of the giant dragonkin.</p>
<p>『Let everyone move within Fran’s reach!』</p>
<p>「Nn. Everyone, hurry!」</p>
<p>Even though they had been hit hard, they were still an elite army. They immediately obeyed Fran’s orders and began to move with their injured comrades on their backs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I saw the giant-type on its knees swinging its right hand toward Isario. But Isario was already gone at that time.</p>
<p>She avoided the giant-type attack by moving at high speed. She went around to the side, firing flames to attack. It looked like a feint, but the flames were from an S-ranked adventurer.</p>
<p>He penetrated through the giant-type defenses and scorched the surface of his body. Although his regeneration began immediately, there was no doubt that he had been slightly damaged.</p>
<p>I could see the giant’s attention shifted from the second unit to Isario. They must have completely recognized Isario as their prey.</p>
<p>「I’ll prepare for the ritual magic while the Red lotus Blade-dono is drawing in! The adventurers should rescue the injured!」</p>
<p>Following your instructions, the survivors formed a formation. We took a position in front of them and acted as a defense.</p>
<p>(It won’t cause any damage anymore.)</p>
<p>Fran was in a position to knead her magic power and unleash her big moves at any time. The most solid way would be to just use the ritual magic of General Hagane and finish it off with Isario and us.</p>
<p>It was so close to the town that we couldn’t consider it any further. We had no choice but to tolerate some damage now.</p>
<p>Just when we had decided how to appear and braced ourselves. Fran then turned to the side.</p>
<p>I could see some kind of shadow flying in the western sky. At first, I thought it was a pack of bird, but that didn’t turn out to be the case. There were no such big ones on this continent.</p>
<p>「Something’s flying!」</p>
<p>『It’s a rock! Storage!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>It was countless rocks. It looked more like I was crushing and throwing rocks there than rubble. More than twenty of them had attacked us.</p>
<p>Who the hell did this do? I’ve been keeping an eye on the movements of these giants for a long time, so this was not exactly what they did.</p>
<p>Then we sensed something approaching us from a distance with tremendous force. It looked human, but it was not a human. It was just too huge.</p>
<p>『That’s one giant-type now!』</p>
