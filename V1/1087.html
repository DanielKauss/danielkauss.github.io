</div><h1>Chapter 1087</h1><p>Gamudo’s Dragon Panisher swung down at the base of his mountain dragon’s neck.</p>
<p>「Dooooooooaaahhh!」</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The roar of a mountain dragon echoed through the air, and I saw Gamudo blown up like a fireworks display. The armor made of dwarves was crushed and crumbled into tatters. If they hit the ground as it was, even Gamudo would not be in good shape, right?</p>
<p>I wondered whether I should help him or not, but I saw Diaz running. This was not the first time, and I can handle it if I leave that part to Diaz.</p>
<p>Mountain dragons, on the other hand, were in bad shape too.</p>
<p>A deep crater was drilled into the base of his neck, not to mention the scales and flesh, but even the bones had been gouged out. No matter how energetic the dragon was, this was probably not damage that could be done with a laugh.</p>
<p>「I can feel its magic stone!」</p>
<p>『Yeah! Do it fast before you can regenerate it!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Fran dashed down into the sky to put a stop to the mountain dragons that were lying on the ground and moaning.</p>
<p>「Gyooooogh!」</p>
<p>However, the mountain dragons were not completely neutralized either. They gathered all their strength and turned their faces toward us, and then roared.</p>
<p>An invisible shockwave shook Fran. But I knew something was coming.</p>
<p>『Doryaaaah!』</p>
<p>She hit the wind magic to offset the shockwave and made her barrier thicker to penetrate the roar of the mountain dragon.</p>
<p>『Fran! Get him!』</p>
<p>「Nn! Thaah!」</p>
<p>Fran unleashed her all-out thrust. And at the same time, I extended my blade far into the air.</p>
<p>I pierced through the hard flesh, which contained strong magic power, and my blade certainly caught the magic stone. A large amount of magic power was flowing into me.</p>
<p>『We took them!』</p>
<p>「Gryaaaaaaaaaahhhh!」</p>
<p>Being exposed to the roar of a doom up close, Fran was greatly blown away. Although the damage was less thanks to the fact that she had put up a barrier, I’m glad we didn’t let our guard down.</p>
<p>I myself have lost a lot of my durability due to the combination of the Divine Attribute and Evil Conquest. And the recovery of my durability has been slow. If I don’t use the combination as a trump card, I might suffer one day.</p>
<p>But before we could call out to Fran, something terrible happened.</p>
<p>《The effect of self-evolution has been activated. 100 self-evolution points have been earned》</p>
<p>『Huh?』</p>
<p>You just evolved a little while ago, didn’t you? So, you’re saying that one of these mountain dragons was worth more than a thousand magic stones! I’d expect as much from a dragonkin!</p>
<p>My self-evolution level had finally reached twenty.</p>
<p>Did I! Fran! You evolved again!</p>
<p>I was going to shout that, but my voice didn’t reach Fran. But before I could, my soul was summoned to a familiar place.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it was a mental world or a sacred area, but it was a white space that appeared when Fenrir-san faced me.</p>
<p>In this infinite space of white that I couldn’t even recognize, I was slowly swaying around. I was getting used to it now, so I didn’t panic.</p>
<p>We haven’t been back over there in time anyway. It’s a pity we won’t be able to share this excitement with Fran right away.</p>
<p>「Hey, Master」</p>
<p>『That voice, Fenrir-san? Did you wake up?』</p>
<p>「It would be more correct to say that he was awakened」</p>
<p>A black creature appeared in the white space. It was a black wolf. It looked very similar to Urushi, but more vile and Divine.</p>
<p>And it was huge. I didn’t know if size was meaningful in this place, but it was big anyway. I’m now in my life, but my eyeballs alone are bigger than mine.</p>
<p>From his feet to the top of his head, it was probably about 400 to 500 meters long, right?</p>
<p>I didn’t feel the slightest hint of fear. The sudden appearance of the Great Magic Beast didn’t even surprise me. It was probably because she understood that this person was half of her friend’s body.</p>
<p>However, we could not help but be surprised by the next group that appeared.</p>
<p>The three women were unbelievably beautiful. They were the Goddess of the Silver Moon, the Goddess of Chaos, and the Goddess of the Underworld.</p>
<p>「Long time no see.」</p>
<p>『Y-yes』</p>
<p>What do you mean? Until now, a Goddess has never appeared when I evolved myself. It was indeed a level of twenty, or rather, a certainty...</p>
<p>「Congratulations, you done it.」</p>
<p>『Yes? Umm, let’s get it done?』</p>
<p>「Yes. By this growth, the separation of my kin and the Evil God’s soul has been completed. I have deep gratitude to you」</p>
<p>「In other words, you have completed the mission. You did it well!」</p>
<p>「I never thought I’d do it in such a short time. Everyone has done their best so far」</p>
<p>A mission! Yes, a mission! No, you haven’t forgotten, have you? It just took me a while to remember!</p>
<p>「Master... Well, that’s fine」</p>
<p>『Fenrir-san! It’s not like I really forgot about it! It has become so normal that I wasn’t even aware of it!』</p>
<p>「Fuhahaha! I know! I’ve been watching you all this time, after all. In fact, I can only thank you for your hard work」</p>
<p>『W-well then...』</p>
<p>Certainly, I didn’t expect to 『We’ll definitely accomplish our mission!』 However, it was true that I was hoping for Fenrir-san, who had traveled with us, to be well.</p>
<p>「In that case, I will reward you for completing the mission as promised」</p>
<p>『Reward...? Eh? What is reward...?』</p>
<p>The reward I’ll get for completing my mission is――</p>
<p>「I will return your soul to reincarnation on Earth」</p>
<p>「And give me as much power as I can」</p>
<p>「In the next life, you will live a life of talent and luck」</p>
