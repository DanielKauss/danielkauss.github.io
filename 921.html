</div><h1>Chapter 921</h1><p>There was no voice. This was not just a matter. At the same time, power wells up from within, making me wonder if I could control it or not. </p>
<p>《Evil Wolf Sword Fenrir――Rejected by Fenrir, Wisdom Sword Cherubim――Negative. I’m already not a Cherubim, but Announcer-san. Refuse. I have frozen the name change forcibly――No problem. I have temporarily acquired the skills “King Wolf”, “Fantasy Fanaticism”, “Evil Storm Rush” and “Intelligence”. The Mixed Slayer has changed to “Golden Devourer”. Change the Golden Devourer’s ability――Change the Golden Devourer’s skill to a part of the damaged――― What’s the King Wolf Sword, Fenrir?』</p>
<p>『With the power of Oratrio, I’ve got a lot of things in Master going on.  The residue of the Fanatics and the factor of Overgrowth. </p>
<p>『I-I see!  But what if I dispose of or refuse the naming? The Evil Wolf Sword may sound a little scary, but I don’t think it’s a problem if you can’t become stronger temporarily, okay? If I were here, I wouldn’t have been controlled by the Evil Gods, wouldn’t it!  </p>
<p>『In other words, you didn’t want to be controlled!?』</p>
<p>『Yeah.  Master’s soul, which was close to the current person, couldn’t withstand the fusion with my soul. If I were to move forward temporarily, Master’s soul would be crushed and disappear!』</p>
<p>『Uwaah?  Well, seriously?』</p>
<p>  I was in danger of extinction without my knowledge!  </p>
<p>『Besides. If I were to bring myself forward, I would take the initiative of the sword, wouldn’t I?  In other words, the Evil Gods would be on a rampage without me?』</p>
<p>《That’s right. If the individual named Fenrir becomes the main personality of the sword, he will lose his resistance to the pieces of the Evil Gods》</p>
<p>  No, that’s certainly a terrible thing.  It would completely harm Fran.</p>
<p>《That’s right.  If the individual named Fenrir becomes the main personality of the sword, he will lose his resistance to the pieces of the Evil Gods.  No, that’s certainly terrible.  It’s not an exaggeration to say that Fran’s resistance to evil spirits is more than mine and the Gods.  Other troubles will be left to me and the residue of the Cherubim――No, Announcer-san』</p>
<p>《It’s possible if you’re the individual named Master.》</p>
<p>  In other words, I’m getting too energized and need to control the pieces of the Evil Gods that are trying to step forward.  In fact, I’m starting to get full of evil energy. If I disappear, I’ll start rampaging at once.  </p>
<p>『Okay...  I’ll do it!』</p>
<p>  Either way, if I can’t do it, Fran’s legs will be in trouble. The current Fran would be able to fight without a weapon, but she would be disqualified as a partner for holding her back here.  Let’s live up to Announcer-san and Fenrir’s expectations! </p>
<p>『Fran </p>
<p>(Master! Are you okay?』</p>
<p>  I’m sorry.  I’ll be useless for a while.  I’ll come back soon, wait!  Okay! I’ll do my best until Master returns!)</p>
<p>『I’ll turn down Fran and focus my attention inside myself.  The key will be the skills I’ve just acquired. Evil Spirit Rush is a dangerous skill that strengthens evil spirits.</p>
<p>(Okay!The key would be the skill I just acquired.  The Evil Spirit Rush is a dangerous skill that strengthens evil energy.  But when combined with the Evil Domination, it may be possible to contact the pieces of the Evil Gods inside me and put them under my control.  I activated both skills at the same time.  The effect of the Evil Spirit Rush instantly increased the intensity of the evil within me.  </p>
<p>『Guh...!』</p>
<p>《...!  Fenrir!  Announcer-san! Are you okay!?』</p>
<p>《No problems, no problem!  Don’t worry about this one! </p>
<p>『Okay, I’ll end up as soon as possible!』</p>
<p>  I focused more on looking for the piece of the Evil God that should have had its presence enhanced by the Evil Spirit Rush.  Then I could sense a lump of evil energy, as if it had been concentrated in one place. It was the deepest part of me.  It was a place covered in black darkness, where I couldn’t see anything. </p>
<p>『Oi, piece of the Evil God』</p>
<p>『Uwooh!I focused more on looking for the pieces of the Evil Gods that had increased their presence through the flow of evil energy.  Then, I was able to sense a lump of evil energy, as if it had been concentrated in one place.  It was the deepest level within me, a place covered in black darkness.  </p>
<p>『Oi, Fragment of the Evil God!  Eat everything!』</p>
<p>『Oi, yeah, yes.  It’s so noisy.  It was a little too quiet.』</p>
<p>『Ghaaaah!』</p>
<p>  I ignored my usual “eat everything!』</p>
<p>  and activated my Evil Domination. I concentrated all my power into my skills.  Even though my skills were there, they were still pieces of the Evil God.  I couldn’t control them easily. I continued to resist even when I knew that my control couldn’t work against me.  However, the power over there was no effect on me, and my skill would definitely put all of my power under my control. My victory was unwavering. </p>
<p>『Aahoooh!』</p>
<p>『That’s so noisy!  I already know that it couldn’t work on me! Control the Evil God Fragment!』</p>
<p>『......!  All right, the Evil God Fragment was terrified.  She was quiet when she shouted before, and she was surprisingly weak to the touch.  Or rather, she looked weak to push.  And I then concentrated all my strength and succeeded in sealing the Evil God Fragment at once. I couldn’t control the pieces themselves, but I would have been able to stay close to being sealed.  Moreover, there was an unexpected byproduct.  It allowed me to control the Evil Spirits inside me at will. In other words, the amount of magic power has doubled.  </p>
<p>『Fine, I’ve done it.』</p>
<p>『Thank you.  We’ll take care of the inside.』</p>
<p>『Yeah, I’m on it!』</p>
