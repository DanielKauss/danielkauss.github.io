</div><h1>Chapter 979</h1><p>Frederick pleaded with Fran to save Velmeria, who had been taken away by the Dragon King’s hands. Fran could not shake her head when she heard his tragic words. But she couldn’t nod immediately. We were now members of the second unit, so we could not leave the unit on our own. Fran looked back at Isario and tried to open her mouth. </p>
<p>「Isario, me――」</p>
<p>「Are you sure? But there are conditions.」</p>
<p> However, there are conditions」</p>
<p>「Understood?」</p>
<p>  Isario didn’t seem to be able to do much, no matter how light-hearted he was, but he was not so good as to nod here. Rather, we should be grateful for the fact that he would allow us to leave even under certain conditions. However, what came out of Isario’s mouth were unexpected words.  </p>
<p>「We’ll accompany you too. Then, let’s allow you to do so」</p>
<p>「Nn?  Isario and Zelos Reed are with us? Why?」</p>
<p>「The Dragon King, Trismegistus, and the Dragon priestess. That’s what I’ve heard, so we can’t ignore it.」</p>
<p>「That’s right.  Considering the relationship between the giant-type and the magic circle, we can’t help but doubt the Dragon King’s participation.  We have to confirm it.」</p>
<p> It wasn’t just Isario, the scout jumped on us.  </p>
<p>「Are you sure?」</p>
<p>「We can’t let them control the antidemons if they want. The worst-case scenario is that he might even be able to manipulate the Abyss Eater, right?」</p>
<p> Well, I may be able to manipulate it, even if it’s a bit much.  I looked again and again, and it turned out to be a huge deal.  </p>
<p>「Alright. </p>
<p>「Of course.  I’m rather grateful」</p>
<p>「Then, I’ll ask for a guide, okay?」</p>
<p>「Let me lead.  Please follow me」</p>
<p>  Frederick flew his wings as he said that. As magic power was released, his body lifted.  </p>
<p>「Frederick, did you get born with it?」</p>
<p>「Yeah.  I did be a little reckless though」</p>
<p> Did the dragonkin actually have a technique to get his body closer to the dragon in the first place?  I wondered why the other dragonkin didn’t do that, but it seemed to be quite dangerous. Frederick seemed to have also transformed his own body in preparation for his death.  He continued his march toward the center of the continent with greater force than ever before. Frederick seemed to be in a great hurry, and if he didn’t let his guards down, everyone except us would be left behind.  However, the adventurers and soldiers did not complain. This was probably because they were elites, and they had a sense of duty to stop the Dragon King.  On the way there, we asked Frederick about something that had been bothering us.  </p>
<p>「Hey. How did you know where I was?」</p>
<p>「It’s a unique skill I have.  It’s a power that combined horology and intuition.」</p>
<p>「Ooh, amazing!」</p>
<p>『Looks useful!』</p>
<p>  It seems to be a skill that helps people to find what they’re looking for. However, it didn’t seem to be that useful. When it comes to items that the other party consciously tried to hide or someone intentionally tried to hide, the search accuracy will be severely reduced. Because of this, it was difficult to find the Dragon King or evil crystals, and Tilanaria and Zelos Reed’s location was unknown. In Fran’s case, she was not hiding anything, so she was able to find them. Frederick didn’t have such power when we first met him at the royal capital, so he must have acquired this skill through the increase of evil dragonkin’s power. </p>
<p>「If we make full use of this power, we might be able to find out where Velmeria and Tilanaria-sama are......」</p>
<p>  Even if they didn’t have any intention of hiding them, they seemed unable to activate their Innate Skills due to the will of someone who wanted to hide them. Indeed, it seems surprisingly difficult to use. A day after our encounter with Frederick, the second unit set foot in the central part of the continent. The weeds were already gone, and there was no sign of animals.  The antidemons must have devoured them.  </p>
<p>「There’s someone there.」</p>
<p>「I can’t sense any dragonkin. That’s bad.  They must be exposing their hostility.」</p>
<p> But before we could do so, a group of dragonkin stood in front of us.  They must have sensed our presence and were on their way.  Although they were obviously hostile, they couldn’t attack out of nowhere. While preparing their troops for battle, Isario made his move forward.  </p>
<p>「I have some business ahead! It would be a hindrance if we could stay there, wouldn’t it?」</p>
<p>「...... No one is allowed to enter the area beyond here.」</p>
<p>「Who has decided?」</p>
<p>「It is our king.」</p>
<p>「Did you guys have a king over there?  You mean Trismegistus?」</p>
<p>「No!  Our king is only Georg-sama!  That fool is our king?  Don’t be ridiculous!  I will not forgive you anymore. The dragonkin shouted, and readied their weapons at once. They looked like they had no choice but to fight anymore. Isario sighed and pointed his sword at the dragonkin.  </p>
<p>「Guess I have no choice.  I will take care of them.  Oh, don’t be afraid. We won’t ask for help from anyone behind if that’s all we need.」</p>
<p>  Isario provoked the dragonkin.  For him, it would be easier to fight the dragonkin on his own than to a disorderly brawl.  However, Fran called out to them worried. Although he was better than after the giant-type battle, he still seemed to be exhausted. </p>
<p>「Isario, are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Hahaha!  Even if they’re not in top form, it’s not a problem for these guys.」</p>
<p> I guess this was due to the effect of her provoking skills, but I could see the dragonkin’s anger peaking at once.  </p>
<p>「K-You little!  You fool us with your inferiority habit!」</p>
<p>  Anyways, the boiling point seemed to be too low. They didn’t seem to be in a decent mental state by any stretch of the imagination.  Are they being manipulated mentally? I’m also curious that the dragonkin living on this continent didn’t even know about Isario.  Even if they didn’t know about him, they might have found out about him after going through Ignis. </p>
<p>「Are you angry?  But I really don’t like bullying the weak.  I’ll fight on my own. So, don’t worry about it, okay?」</p>
<p>「I-I’ll kill you!  I’ll kill you with all my might! Red-haired Ape!」</p>
<p>「Hahahaha!I couldn’t say a word in the middle of it.I couldn’t say a word in the middle of it. As I thought, something was wrong with me.</p>
