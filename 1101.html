</div><h1>Chapter 1101</h1><p>After defeating the undead under the name of Hydeman, we returned to the royal castle for the time being. We wanted to get some information about Hydeman from Derick. There, we found a familiar face waiting for us.</p>
<p>「Fran!」</p>
<p>「Eliante!」</p>
<p>That’s Eliante, the Guild Master of the Royal Capital.</p>
<p>Was she just a little angry?</p>
<p>「Exactly! When you come to the royal capital, show your face to me first, okay?」</p>
<p>「I was going to leave.」</p>
<p>「I know it can’t be helped, but I want to tell you!」</p>
<p>Before we could go to say hello, we had accepted a request from Esmeralda at the royal castle. Eliante seemed to know that too, but she ended up complaining.</p>
<p>「In the first place, we would never be able to refuse that request from that monster old hag. I was just surprised to hear that your name was suddenly added to the participants of this request」</p>
<p>「You know about Esmeralda?」</p>
<p>「Regrettably though, since she’s a former Rank A adventurer. She was retired when I first became guild master, there are still many legends. Even after serving the royal family, there are still plenty of legends out there, you know?」</p>
<p>Since she was an underling, Esmeralda seldom comes forward herself. However, there were plenty of incidents and legends that could be understood by those who listened to her as being the work of Esmeralda.</p>
<p>「The most famous one is the blood rat, who got his alias, isn’t it?」</p>
<p>「The blood rat? Isn’t that Esmeralda’s alias for the cemetery?」</p>
<p>「When you become a famous adventurer, mercenary, or knight, you often have several aliases. Not only the Black Lightning Princess, but also the Black Cat Saintess, the Magic Sword girl, and many others. Aah, it seems that Barbra has begun to be called 『Fleet Crusher』」</p>
<p>Eh? Crunching the fleet... Seriously? No, it was certainly crushing the fleet. However, the adventurers watched Fran fight, and they also reported that she had sunk the Raidos fleet.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t be surprised if the adventurers, who knew this, called them that way. After all, they had destroyed a large fleet of water dragonkin. They were probably more wary than we thought.</p>
<p>「Esmeralda-san’s alias is particularly famous for the 『zain』 that you know. It was named after the fact that she doesn’t move at all and uses sand to rule over super areas」</p>
<p>Back when she was an adventurer, she had killed a large number of Kobolds while staying in town. After she became a stealthy scout, she used her ability to monitor the entire capital and cleared up criminals and interrogation one after another. That’s why the nickname of the group has become widely known.</p>
<p>「And another famous one is the 『blood rat』. This is also the derogatory title that those who don’t like Esmeralda-san call her though」</p>
<p>Esmeralda sometimes even killed them. I don’t know if I could call it an assassin or not, but it seemed that she sometimes remotely handled the serious criminals who were currently committing them. Even the nobles were merciless and hated her as a dangerous person.</p>
<p>The method of killing him was to hunt his head with a sand rat. The sand rat that Esmeralda unleashed as a stealthy substitute quickly turned into an assassin and bit into his neck. From the red-colored sand rats that gushed out of the blood, he had become known as a blood rat among the nobles.</p>
<p>「That person sometimes calls himself a blood rat. Because of that, blood rats are even more famous right now」</p>
<p>「Gyahahaha! You’d better have a name with Doss’s advantage, right?」</p>
<p>「!! When did you get that?」</p>
<p>「I’m the one in charge of stealth after all. I’m very good at concealing my presence.」</p>
<p>Eliante turned around in surprise and saw an esmeralda floating at the entrance to the room. In addition to her stealth techniques, she must have used a quiet sand chair to hide her presence even more.</p>
<p>Both Fran and I noticed, but Eliante didn’t notice the approach.</p>
<p>「You’d better refrain from making requests not to go through the guild, right?」</p>
<p>「Here it is, the request form」</p>
<p>「Don’t do this after everything is over! Don’t take advantage of a child as much as you can! I’ve been hated by other guildmasters!」</p>
<p>Oops, he hadn’t passed through the guild yet. It’s not like I was guilty, but I don’t want to think I’d let the guild down.</p>
<p>No, it seems like Esmeralda was telling me the truth. Is that all right?</p>
<p>「But isn’t that more convenient for you guys?」</p>
<p>「What do you mean?」</p>
<p>「The reputation of the Black Lightning Princess from our country has gone up a lot, you know? I’m sure you’ll be happy」</p>
<p>What the hell? Maybe it’s the political stuff between the guild and the country? The guild’s authority should also be strengthened by having strong adventurers after all.</p>
<p>「......How far do you see it?」</p>
<p>「Y-Y-Y-Y-Yeeees! You’re a monster blunder after all!」</p>
<p>「Did you hear that?」</p>
<p>「Any bad word you say about me in the royal capital is now over my ears.」</p>
<p>The esmeralda that he laughed at was so intimidating that it made me wonder if she was joking. Eliante thought she couldn’t win any more argument, and fell silent with a wry smile.</p>
<p>「Guh...」</p>
<p>「Hey, can I report it to you? Or do you already know?」</p>
<p>「Oh, I’m sorry. We’ve been talking about this for a long time. The little girl was annoying, and I found it annoying.」</p>
<p>「Nn, I’m fine」</p>
<p>Eliante said something, but she didn’t open her mouth in the end. She must have realized that she couldn’t win with her mouth even if she continued to argue.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Fran told Esmeralda everything she had gotten.</p>
<p>「Mm-hmm. I heard in the sand that the Black Skeleton Corps is a troublesome opponent. If you’re an undead, it might be easy to replenish it」</p>
<p>Certainly, it may be possible to increase the number of seats with the bodies of powerful people. This time, we defeated the sixth seat, but there is a possibility that a new sixth seat will soon appear.</p>
<p>「I want to ask Derick about Hydeman」</p>
<p>「I’ve already got it.」</p>
<p>It seems that before we returned, we had already interrogated him. Apparently, Hydman was one of the top secretaries under the Southern Duke’s command. He was a very skilled stealth specialist type that could be found everywhere. The loss of his delicates with him would surely weaken him considerably in information battles.</p>
<p>「Gyahahaha, that’s a good one. Black Lightning Princess.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Anyways, requests from the government will be fulfilled by this. You worked really hard」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「You can do whatever you want after this. If you’re going to work in the Royal Capital, there are other things I would like to ask you to do, and if you’re going to the north, I’ll write you a letter of introduction to the Lord of Alessa. Well, you may not need it though」</p>
