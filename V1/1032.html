</div><h1>Chapter 1032</h1><p>Trismegistus holds up Juanaverta while saying that he’ll reward him.</p>
<p>Fran was caught off guard, but she didn’t suddenly slash at us.</p>
<p>「Fran, take your leave」</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>Another spirit, huh!? Fran, who was originally wary of Trismegistus, took a clear defense with that spirit. Perhaps the effect was not as great if she had hit the current Fran with a “lying down” spirit. It was the same as the order to “do not move” against me that only had an effect for a moment.</p>
<p>But what if it was an order to do what she was trying to do more properly? Even a strong person like Fran might be able to move by word of mouth.</p>
<p>Both Fran and I were puzzled because we didn’t know what Trismegistus was trying to do. But the same went for the Juanaverta we had with Trismegistus.</p>
<p>『O Lord, what do you want me to do?』</p>
<p>「I’ll have Fran and Urushi reward us.」</p>
<p>『What do you mean......?』</p>
<p>Even Juanaverta seemed to have trouble grasping the meaning of Trismegistus’ actions.</p>
<p>Trismegistus spoke no further in vain and swung Juanaverta at us. I couldn’t sense any killing intent, but that was common sense for this guy.</p>
<p>「Juanaverta, you. The transformation of your mind due to the original sin of jealousy has progressed too. The harm of your presence is already greater than the benefit of your presence」</p>
<p>『W-What the...... W-What the......? I would sacrifice myself for you――』</p>
<p>「Indeed. I call you a true vassal, but this is no longer necessary.」</p>
<p>『Trismegistus-sama! Please wait!』</p>
<p>What suddenly began? Arguing, or rather, a feeling of melancholy...</p>
<p>Without stopping, Trismegistus slashed at Fran with a swift slash.</p>
<p>『I-it doesn’t need it? What the hell! What the hell!?』</p>
<p>「Fran, 『Let’s take it』</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>It was again. Fran, who had received the Spirit of Voice, took defensive action against Juanaverta as if she were swung down by me.</p>
<p>It was Juanaverta who shouted in panic when he saw Fran like that.</p>
<p>『Trismegistus-sama! I have magic power on my blade! Please! If things continue like this――』</p>
<p>「Juanaverta. All loyalty has been very great up until now.」</p>
<p>Trismegistus, who possessed Swordking Mastery, could tell how to swing his sword so that it was less taxing and more efficient. In other words, he also knew how to wield it and how to strike it to break his sword.</p>
<p>Kinda.</p>
<p>I heard a light sound and Juanaverta’s blade got cut in half from the middle.</p>
<p>『Gyaaaaaaahhh!』</p>
<p>『Uwooooh!?』</p>
<p>Juanaverta and I screamed and reverberated through the air.</p>
<p>My Cannibalism skill had been activated, allowing Juanaverta’s power to flow into us.</p>
<p>《Confirming the activation of the Cannibalism skill. Urgent activation.》</p>
<p>『Announcer-san...』</p>
<p>《Affirmative load that was far greater than expected is detected. Block most of the output to the outside world. Suspend internal work temporarily and concentrate on controlling power. The number of days it took for the power to be restored is unknown》</p>
<p>So, would Announcer-san be so dependable to control the power gained from this cannibalize? She wouldn’t be able to talk to us again in the meantime, and she didn’t know when the resurrection would be.</p>
<p>『I’m sorry again』</p>
<p>《The individual named Master, I’m fine. May you all have the blessing of the Goddess of Wisdom》</p>
<p>She fell asleep, huh? I’m so reliable every time...... But thanks to Announcer-san, I’ve managed to weaken the uncontrollable torrent of power and control it even by myself.</p>
<p>But even when the overflowing magic power subsided, something else had not changed at all. Not only power but also Juanaverta’s emotions flowed into me.</p>
<p>Announcer-san also said that it was difficult to interfere with emotions. A variety of negative emotions that Juanaverta had pushed were swirling intensely within me.</p>
<p>Sadness at the inability to work for the Lord, anger and jealousy at me for causing this, and worry about his future.</p>
<p>However, there was no dissatisfaction or anger toward Trismegistus for destroying him. Although I had gone crazy due to the original sin of jealousy, my loyalty to him was real.</p>
<p>That was why she felt so sorry for him.</p>
<p>I looked at Trismegistus, panting under the sheer burden of being unable to eat due to my cannibalism. I could tell that was all I needed as long as I could feel some pity for him.</p>
<p>I’m sure this swirling emotion, which even I myself couldn’t quite understand, will be over.</p>
<p>However, Trismegistus’ face was not showing any emotion as usual. It seemed that there was no humanity left to sense sadness anymore.</p>
<p>Trismegistus and Juanaverta looked pity on him. Why was he an enemy I hated so much?</p>
<p>No, I know. I guess they unconsciously overlapped with me and Fran. What if they become the same too? When I thought about it, I felt like I was going crazy.</p>
<p>It might not be possible for Fran to become like Trismegistus, but I don’t know what will happen to her.</p>
<p>Fran, holding the smaller form of Urushi, used the last of her strength to run to the sky at once. I thought she was strong, but that was not the only reason.</p>
<p>Immovable negative thoughts rushed around in my head, driven by Juanaverta’s emotions. I knew this, but I couldn’t switch between moods.</p>
<p>「Master? Don’t mind? Don’t worry, I’ll accompany you」</p>
<p>『Yeah...』</p>
<p>But strangely enough, the moment I heard Fran’s voice, all my negative emotions disappeared――I felt them. They hadn’t disappeared, but I didn’t notice them.</p>
<p>『Don’t worry. I’m just me』</p>
<p>「?? Naturally, Master is Master. He’s my Master and my partner」</p>
<p>『Haha, you’re right』</p>
<p>I knew Fran was the best partner I could be. She would definitely make Fran sad, wouldn’t she? I would never go crazy.</p>
