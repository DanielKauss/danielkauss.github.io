</div><h1>Chapter 1039</h1><p>My name is Juanaverta, and I am the one serving the great Dragon King, Trismegistus-sama. I have to say I have one stomach, one arm of the great dragonkin. Ah, a pity for my king. Trismegistus-sama always smiled in trouble and said that he was among his kin. I could not leave that stupid dragonkin behind with arrogance and pride. Trismegistus-sama, who didn’t like to fight, was looked down upon. They didn’t even try to hide his attitude. They did not try to hide his attitude.  But after they knew his alchemy talent, he approached us as if he had turned his hand.  He had a thick face and was shameless.  He was greedy and weak, and had no choice but to fight.  That was the dragonkin. He offered to abandon them and leave the country many times, but he nodded at me.  Because I’m a king.</p>
<p>「Trismegistus......  I have heard the rumors, but to think the magical sword capable of devouring antidemons actually existed.  To think the magical sword capable of devouring antidemons actually existed.The Lord had suggested many times that he would abandon them and leave the country, but he nodded his head.  He said he was king, so he had to work for the sake of the people...  That king’s status was something that had been pushed to the dragonkin.  He even claimed the throne only in order to bind Trismegistus-sama to his country and make effective use of it, which he said he wanted to do quietly.  There was no way the king could refuse when he said it was for his people. He said it was the decision of who was born into the King’s Golden Dragon. So, I Lord, who had to take care of many useless people, spread a number of groundbreaking magic tools throughout the country.  Magic tools to keep the room temperature constant.  Magic tools to clean the scales and body in an instant.  Magic tools to store food.  My life was getting richer, but the dragonkin’s appetites continued. Now they have enough food, clothes, and shelter, and the war will begin.  My Lord has approached me to make useful magic tools for the battlefield.  A magic tool from a distance.  A magic tool from a hole. A magical tool for blocking walls. It was the most fearsome and relentless time when the Lord alone sustained the endless desire of the Dragonkin.  At that time, my Lord came out on the battlefield.  The Dragonmen forced him to carry him out. I think it was about that time that I got a cold-blooded witch or a slaughter swordsman. I was called the Shadow of the Golden King, but no matter how well I played, I was still an Elves.  In Gordicia at that time, the Elves were treated like dragonkin servants. The Dragonmen’s shit refused to let me be next to the King.  They used every single hand to separate me from the Lord and had been harassing me in every way they could.At times, they even pulled me apart from the Lord on the battlefield and put me in danger.  Well, the dragonkin who gave the false report killed me in a reasonable way to show off.  After half of my body was frozen, I slowly peeled off the scales over a period of about seven days and died. That was a spectacle, wasn’t it?  But that didn’t end with the harassment.  The dragonkin leaders had no choice but to shove their daughter into the Lord’s office. I seemed to think of it as a hindrance, but there was no such thing as affection between a man and a woman between me and Trismegistus-sama.  It was not an emotion that conveniently misunderstood my survival instincts and lust, but pure loyalty that I harbor.  All I carry is loyalty, which never changes, like a Kongo-stone.  So, if the king wants to take a queen, let’s welcome it.  But those who don’t seem to understand that. I don’t like the stupidity of not being able to measure it on my own.  One day, I was attacked by multiple dragonkin and was seriously injured.Then one day, I was attacked by several dragonkin and was seriously injured on the verge of death.  There seemed to be a life dragonkin, and even recovery magic could not close the wounds.  As a result, I became the subject of one research.  It was the creation of an Intelligence Weapon.  Originally, my research was to create a sword with a soul-embedded human being that would give us advice on the battlefield. However, I couldn’t create anything satisfactory in terms of performance, so I shifted in the direction of incorporating humans directly...  And as a result of several experiments with slaves, my mind broke and I couldn’t succeed. It must be that harsh for a human soul to dwell in a sword.  But I cannot die. As a result, the experiment was successful. I had somehow acquired the skill “Devotion” and it seemed to have prevented me from going crazy by energizing my mind.  However, it was not perfect.  I can feel my heart gradually wear off. I have to solidify Trismegistus-sama’s status while I was away.  Trismegistus-sama must have also been aware of my condition.Trismegistus-sama must have realized my condition before I could properly defend myself.  I wanted to achieve the goal of shutting up the other dragonkin while I was not crazy.  As a result, I regret not doing anything about that tragedy. I regretted doing too much about it.  I had to warn them about it, but I’d incite them instead.  My Judgement must have been dulled by the sword transformation. But the true tragedy for me had come after this.  As an immortal sinner, I will continue to fight the Abyss Eater that I created. It was the punishment for the Lord, and I was given the role of watching over it.  The skill of determination evolved into the skill of eternal loyalty, allowing me to exist forever. But it was a torture to keep watching the Lord mutate over a long period of time.  </p>
<p>「Juanaverta, you saved today. I look forward to working with you tomorrow.  Please leave it to me.」</p>
<p>「Yeah, I’m glad you were here」</p>
<p>「Juanaverta, I’m going to wield all my power」</p>
<p>『Ha!  Let’s do our best!』</p>
<p>「Yeah, you’re right, Juanaverta.  Let’s go」</p>
<p>「Yeah.  My conversation continued to diminish, my fever disappeared from the words I responded to, and my face lost expression. The prison of time was more cruel and terrifying than most people had imagined.  Still, there was no cloud of my loyalty.  I will continue to support you. That incident changed me.  A battle with a Divine Sword user wielding poison and demon power.  It seemed that the man was stupidly aiming for Trismegistus-sama’s eternity. The foolishness of living forever seemed to be quite great. Considering the characteristics of the original skill of jealousy, he thought that he could be taken away, but he must have been unable to lay a finger on Divine Punishment.  As a result, he turned to my skill.  It may not be immortal, but it could be a risk. That was what I thought and took away my eternal loyalty.  It was a skill that someone forced me to pledge allegiance, but what happened to that man?  In my case, I swear allegiance to Trismegistus-sama from the former. I had no problem...  Well, it doesn’t matter what. Instead of losing my eternal loyalty, I was forced to bear the source of my jealousy on the equivalent exchange.  It started with an even worse start.  I had no control over my mind and couldn’t believe that I was screaming. Moreover, my skills and self were becoming more and more familiar and I didn’t feel anything strange.  I wanted to erase this ugly and incompetent me. Such thoughts were gradually filled with jealousy and pushed deep into the earth.  Then the time came.  </p>
<p>『Trismegistus-sama!  Magic power on the blade! At this rate―― I screamed uglyly, but it soon disappeared.  With the feeling of myself being preyed on, my mind was regained its balance. The destruction of my mind must have weakened the effects of the original sin of jealousy.  Oh, thanks, my Lord.  With this, I can disappear...  But will I be okay without me? I have no choice but to worry about whether that fake Intelligence Weapon would be able to support you.  Anyway, is this sword’s memory flowing into me as if it was a replacement for my faded consciousness from earlier?Aah, this is......Aah, this is...... jealous―.</p>
