</div><h1>Chapter 1015</h1><p>It was Seliadot’s ward that saved Fran.</p>
<p>「Black Lightning Princess, come!」</p>
<p>「What about Seliadot?」</p>
<p>「I will hold that thing back here.」</p>
<p>After saying that, the lorelei girl looked up at the antidemons. Her face was filled with hostility towards them and strong determination.</p>
<p>「You’re not a member of Merritte’s mercenary brigade?」</p>
<p>「No way. I’ve tried to do that through the friendship of my kin, but I never thought I’d do something like this......」</p>
<p>The ward he gave to Meritte had a call feature, which he used to listen to our conversation with Meritte.</p>
<p>That’s why he seemed to know to some extent that Meritte was trying to do something. His shoulders slumped and he looked regrettable.</p>
<p>「I don’t have time to talk now! I’m coming!」</p>
<p>「Uuurghh!」</p>
<p>「Recoil? Tch!」</p>
<p>I thought Seliadot and Meritte were friends, but apparently, they were not. They tried to block the fist swung down by the giant antidemon, but it failed.</p>
<p>「This way!」</p>
<p>『Orraa!』</p>
<p>Fran jumped back while holding Seliadot, and with my telekinesis and magic, she slowed down her fist slightly. Was this just a last-ditch effort?</p>
<p>But it was just right after I forced my magic power to be activated in an attempt to activate my telekinesis.</p>
<p>A huge black object rained down from above, covering the antidemon’s fist. The weight and impact of the object caused the fist to change its trajectory toward the ground.</p>
<p>『Urushi! Great job!』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>It was the evolved Urushi. He made use of his huge body, which looked like a small mountain, to block his movements by biting into the arms of the giant antidemons. But it wouldn’t last long.</p>
<p>Even though its huge body was over 30 meters long, it was still not as big as an antidemon. After all, its opponent was like a high-rise building. In front of it, even Urushi was now only the size of a small dog.</p>
<p>Urushi’s body was already about to be lifted.</p>
<p>However, thanks to Urushi’s time, Fran and Urushi’s escape was complete. Urushi, who had seen it, has also shrunk his body and left the antidemon front.</p>
<p>The antidemons seemed to be at a loss because of the sudden disappearance of the giant wolf. They were looking at our surroundings with a puzzled look.</p>
<p>It was so huge that he couldn’t seem to see anything close to his body. Fran and Urushi, who had taken a great distance from him, and Urushi, who had left, had finally joined up.</p>
<p>「Urushi, thanks for saving us」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>『What happened to Velmeria and Frederick?』</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>When I checked the direction Urushi showed with his nose, I could feel a large amount of magic power. He had entrusted it to the second unit.</p>
<p>The second unit was quite far from the castle. Urushi instructed them? No, they must have judged that something was wrong by watching Urushi.</p>
<p>『Let’s get out of here too.』</p>
<p>「Nn. Urushi, Seliadot. Come on.」</p>
<p>We couldn’t win on our own. Fran, who knew this, nodded her head, but Seliadot waited for her.</p>
<p>「You should run away. I’ll draw its attention.」</p>
<p>「You’re not running away?」</p>
<p>「I can’t get away... What Meritte did was a great crime. She might even be punished by the gods.」</p>
<p>Now that you mention it, I see? He manipulated the Abyss Eater, created a large number of antidemons, and took the lives of many innocent people.</p>
<p>As for me, I can’t forgive the part about killing a lot of innocent people, but I don’t think the Gods would care. Gods have the Gods of Humans, but there are also the Gods of Beasts and Insects, and the Gods of plants.</p>
<p>From someone other than those people’s point of view, it could be said that humanity as a whole was carving for forests, hunting beasts, and controlling insects. In the first place, Ashwrath and Isario were taking a lot of people’s lives in war between humans.</p>
<p>However, I have not heard stories of them being blamed by the Gods for that. Perhaps, unless they were exposed to their realm, Gods were not involved in the battle for survival or the killing of other living creatures.</p>
<p>The problem here was probably her manipulation of the Abyss Eater. Since the pieces of the Evil Gods were mixed in the Abyss Eater, it might be treated as a one-sided use of the Gods.</p>
<p>Besides, this continent was within the barrier that the Gods had set up. So, any careless action taken there might be dangerous.</p>
<p>「At the very least, we must not blame the other lorelei.」</p>
<p>The same lorelei would hold back the mistakes that the lorelei made. It seemed that they would try to avoid Divine Punishment for the entire race by doing so. I don’t know if it would be Pramai Zero or not, but it was much better than not doing it.</p>
<p>「You shouldn’t worry about me then」</p>
<p>「...I’ll stay with you too」</p>
<p>「Black Lightning Princess, what are you saying!?」</p>
<p>Seliadot looked surprised.</p>
<p>The same went for me.</p>
<p>『Fran! Don’t be stupid!』</p>
<p>(...I see!)</p>
<p>The lorelei and black cats were very similar in their circumstances and positions to begin with.</p>
<p>Fran’s continued the offensive, but Seliadot didn’t go on the offensive. Now that she saw the look of determination on Seliadot’s face, she could no longer leave her alone. Seliadot was clearly planning to die. It seems she was comparing herself to someone who was risking their lives for the sake of their race.</p>
<p>「Wolf and sword, you guys must stop the Black Lightning Princess!」</p>
<p>「W-Woof?」</p>
<p>『Eh? Sword...?』</p>
<p>「We know the sword has a will of its own. Apparently, we heard about it from someone in the underground. We had intended to take it to the cemetery, but we couldn’t help but be here」</p>
<p>She said she was eavesdropping on Meritte’s conversation, but it seems that she became more aware of us than she had imagined.</p>
<p>「Black Lightning Princess, you run away, and defeat it with the others. Either way, if someone here doesn’t act as a decoy, it will be difficult to escape. So I would be perfect for that role」</p>
<p>『...Fran. Let’s join up with the others first.』</p>
<p>「......Then Seliadot, you too――」</p>
<p>「Hurry! You got me!」</p>
<p>『Damn!』</p>
<p>Just as Seliadot said, I saw a giant antidemon taking a step towards us. But at the same time, I noticed a new presence.</p>
<p>「So many!」</p>
<p>『Adventurers?』</p>
<p>「And from the other side too!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>There was a presence of a large number of people coming towards us. They were definitely looking for the first and third troops. They seemed to be heading for the giant antidemons.</p>
<p>Well, when we saw the huge antidemons accompanying the anomaly, anyone could think of them as the culprits. There was no way the forces originally gathered to fight the giants could ignore him.</p>
<p>I could clearly feel the presence of the strong assigned to each unit.</p>
<p>「We’ll just have to endure it until everyone else comes!」</p>
<p>『Me too, I’d love for her to run away』</p>
<p>From Fran’s head, the two letters of the escape had completely disappeared.</p>
