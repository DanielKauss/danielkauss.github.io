</div><h1>Chapter 1040</h1><p>After saying goodbye to Trismegistus and Zelos Reed, we were back in Nocta. We wanted to rest up for the time being in this city. </p>
<p>「Fran! You’re safe!」</p>
<p>「Fran! You’re back, aren’t you!?」</p>
<p> Sophie and Mea, who had retreated first, greeted us in Nocta. Thank goodness, Sophie seemed to be surprisingly well. Nelsh, her escort, also seemed to be following behind Sophie. Perhaps in response to her being left behind in the battle against the giant antidemons, I could sense a strong will that she was no longer moving. I could feel a strong will not to leave anymore, perhaps in response to the fact that she had been left in the fight against the giant antidemons.  Ashwrath, who had been unconscious when we split up, also approached the gate and waved his hand. The situation did not seem to have reached its peak.  </p>
<p>「Nn!  We didn’t have any antidemons, so it’s okay.」</p>
<p>「I knew it.  We didn’t even encounter any antidemons at all. Is this proof that the Abyss Eater has been weakened?」</p>
<p>「Nn.  There will be no antidemons for a few days.  Will it be a little while before we leave?」</p>
<p>  Fran told them what Trismegistus was saying. Well, it was too difficult for them to remember Fran, but she knew the important part.  </p>
<p>「Those who can’t fight, can get out of here......? That’s not the hard part.」</p>
<p>「Hmm.  That’s a lot of trouble.」</p>
<p>  Sophie expressed her anger and Mea was confused.  Sophie herself was on the side of the continent that had come to Gordicia. She must have understood how difficult it would be for her to escape from Gordicia.  It seems Mea was thinking about what would happen after she escaped from the continent of Gordicia.  Even though she was an old woman like her, she was still a princess. She understands the difficulty of accepting refugees.  </p>
<p>「If you are an extremely large number of Beastmen, your authority alone can manage on your own. But if you have thousands of people, you will need to consult with the government.」</p>
<p>「The Beast King would be fine with Gahahaha.」</p>
<p>「Fran.  Is that like a fool’s father?  Well, I might say that, but he’s still a king. I can’t nod easily.」</p>
<p>  The Beast King looked pompous and was clearly king.  He wouldn’t make any serious decisions on his own.  Moreover, the people living in Gordicia, except for the knights, soldiers, and adventurers from various countries, were mostly serious sinners and their descendants. There was a great risk for the country to accept just because they felt sorry for them.  </p>
<p>「However, if you bring the word of God with you, it would be difficult for us to refuse it completely.</p>
<p>「However, if you bring the word of God with you, it would be difficult for me to refuse it.  I’m sure you’ll want to persuade other countries to use the Commitment for Gordisia, but in the end, you will accept those who want to leave the continent as your settlers, right?」</p>
<p>  Being a settler was quite a hard work in this world.  Well, it was not an easy job even on Earth, but the level of danger in this world was different. In places that were still untouched by humans, they were often in danger of being inhabited by magic beasts in the first place.  It was usually slaves for crimes or nobles who were punished for being hard-fought.  In other words, it was the same as when they were in Gordicia. On the contrary, they were in a hellish state from heaven to the normal people in each city of Gordicia. </p>
<p>「No way......!」</p>
<p>「I’m sorry」</p>
<p>「No, it’s not because of Mea.  But is there another way?」</p>
<p>「Hmm...  I’m sorry, but I didn’t come out immediately. But if you think about it, there might be another good way」</p>
<p>「Nn!  I think too」</p>
<p>「...Thank you」</p>
<p>  They were talking about something important, but I somehow felt relieved.  It was the beautiful friendship between the girls.  I’m glad that Fran and Mea have more friends. Then, a new figure came up to us.  </p>
<p>「Fran!」</p>
<p>「Velmeria!」</p>
<p>  It was Velmeria, the water-haired dragonkin girl. It was the last time I had seen her tattered, but she seemed to have healed quite a bit.  I had never seen her untying a ponytail before, but she looked like a young lady in combination with a white dress. No, she was just a young lady because she was a child between nobles and priestesses.  </p>
<p>「I heard that Fran and Urushi saved my life. Thank you」</p>
<p>「I’m glad you’re safe」</p>
<p>「...It wasn’t useful in the fight though.」</p>
<p>  Velmeria, who recognized herself as a warrior, must have had no patience in this battle. She clenched her fists and lowered her head.  </p>
<p>「But you’re still alive.」</p>
<p>「...... You’re right. Besides, it’s all thanks to you that I’ve been able to see my mother again.」</p>
<p>  Frederick and Tilanaria were standing a little further away. Tilanaria had a strong image of a half-crazed manipulating her, but now she had a gentle expression on her face.  Although their hair color was different, their faces were probably very similar to Velmeria’s.  </p>
<p>「What about Velmeria?」</p>
<p>  Suddenly, Fran asked such a question. Come to think of it, Velmeria was the head of the group that couldn’t leave this continent, right?  She was a wanted person and a half-dragonkin in the Kranzel Kingdom and surrounding areas. She was in a position to take the aftermath of Trismegistus’ request to leave the continent. She had already heard from someone else about this, but her face seemed to have completely disappeared.  </p>
<p>「I’m a warrior.  My mother originally worked as a priestess, so I can handle it.  Frederick, too... Well, not that I can handle it.」</p>
<p>  Frederick’s position was the opposite of Velmeria’s. According to the dragonkin’s laws, he must not be on this continent. Still, Velmeria showed no signs of pessimism, so maybe he can really handle it. One hour after we reunited with Fran’s friends, Fran threw a hard report to Isario and Frederick.  Then, she went to Mulsani’s Ladirua Trading Company.</p>
<p>「Auntie!」</p>
