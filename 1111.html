</div><h1>Chapter 1111</h1><p>『It’s not magic, it’s a direct attack. And if it doesn’t cause damage to the town――』</p>
<p>(Push)</p>
<p>『You’re right. That’s good to hear then』</p>
<p> Fran continued to work on her magic while walking while discussing with me. She hasn’t run out yet. She must have been discerning how to get out of it. She seemed to be planning to calm down and accumulate power until it was attacked. Her opponent was a large spirit. In terms of threat level, she was definitely an A or higher opponent. In terms of threat level, she was unquestionably an A or higher opponent.  So, a bad attack would not work.  She would need to find the nuke and hit it with the biggest blow possible. That’s the best way to go.  </p>
<p>「It’s coming!」</p>
<p>『Ou!』</p>
<p> I couldn’t feel any spirit movement.  However, Fran seemed to be able to sense the spirit’s breathing. She sensed their attack and moved.  A sharper blow than ever pierced the place where Fran was. A deep hole, which could even be called a small crater, opened in the ground.  Apparently, even the Great Spirit was serious. No, it seemed that it had become a clear enemy from the one that was eliminated.  Fran ran through the noble town in its ruined state, evading the spears that were released one after another.  There were no signs of people around.  Did she run away? Or... If she didn’t get out of town quickly, the damage would only increase.  The attacks of the Great Spirit changed, as if she had judged that a single attack was not enough to hit Fran. Small wind bullets began to rain down on a wide area like a shot gun.  Moreover, each shot was quite powerful. So, I’m sure one of them would be enough to kill an orc.  If a single attack was fired in rapid succession, Fran would have no escape. However, Fran stepped forward without stopping.  She knew that I would do something about it.  I created a series of wind walls in the direction of Fran’s movement to create a path for her to follow. Fran plunged in before she could achieve any results, and ran through the small space.  If she was still unable to respond, she slipped through with Dimension Shift. She didn’t use teleportation because it might detect the teleportation destination and attack it in advance when it comes to high-ranking opponents.  She’s experienced it many times in the past.  So, if it’s a high-spirit class, the danger would be high.  When she first moved to Klimut’s party, she didn’t use teleportation that way. Well, in the current Fran, the time it took for her to reach that short distance was not that different.  As a result, Fran had traveled almost the closest distance and was approaching the Great Spirit in no time.  However, the problem came from here.  </p>
<p>『I’m afraid its attack will never stop!』</p>
<p>(Nn)</p>
<p>  It was no longer at the barrage level.  She used wind bullets, wind spears, and wind slashes. The attacks of the Great Spirit that filled the space would have been a surefire fixture in a shooting game.  If it hadn’t been for using Dimension Shift, we wouldn’t have been able to stay unscathed. A spirit has a nucleus and they’re asked to attack it...  </p>
<p>『Where it is? I feel like I’m sensing something...』</p>
<p>  So, this is the presence of a nucleus or a spirit?  I feel a strange sensation, like a chilled spine.  If I try to remember a similar feeling, it’s like when I saw Ignis in Gordicia...? But in the face of a strong opponent, was my danger detection only appealing to something? </p>
<p>『Fran.  What do you think?』</p>
<p>(Nn......  I don’t know.  I don’t feel any sign of him right now. Perhaps because of his magic)</p>
<p>  It was a Dimension Shift, but it seemed that the presence of the other party could also slip through. It’s not that I couldn’t feel it, but it seems that it was not suitable for a situation where I delicately searched for a presence.  </p>
<p>『...We’ll have no choice but to break the Dimension Shift』</p>
<p>(Nn)</p>
<p>  Fran nodded with a motivated expression, but it was not that easy. If we break the Dimension Shift now, we would be hit by a wind attack that still didn’t stop.  </p>
<p>(Klimut said he didn’t have much time)</p>
<p>『Kuh...  That’s right』</p>
<p>  It seemed that we had to find the nucleus while running away. I checked Klimut’s condition for a moment, and I could see that his life force was starting to decrease again. </p>
<p>『Let’s go, are you sure?』</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>『Alright―― Unleash!』</p>
<p>  As soon as he regained his physical form, the explosions and shockwaves rushed toward him at once. Wind attacks of all sizes attacked him from all directions.  We immediately put up barriers, and when we found a slight gap in the wind, we forcibly escaped as if to force him to open. No matter how much she escaped, the wind would follow her wherever she went.  Fran jumped around at high speed, using magic to block out the wind.  However, it was still difficult to avoid them completely.  The vicious attacks that pierced through barriers, which were sometimes mixed in with weak attacks, were troublesome. It was very difficult to detect invisible attacks that were mixed in with hundreds of attacks.  However, Fran did not lose her concentration.However, Fran did not lose her concentration.  She continued to look for the spirit’s nucleus, even though there were countless wounds on her skin and sometimes even bones.  Even so, she couldn’t find it.  And yet, it was approaching its limit.  It was as if we were now running as fast as we could.  Fran had already awakened and used Brilliant Lightning Rush, and I had activated my magic multiple times until the limit. At this rate, we will surely collapse in the not-too-distant future.  But then, a change had appeared in Fran.  From within Fran, a magic power that did not belong to Fran was emanating.</p>
<p>(Nn.</p>
<p>(Nn. Marl is telling me the rest.)</p>
