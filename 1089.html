</div><h1>Chapter 1089</h1><p>『Phew......』</p>
<p>(Master!)</p>
<p>『Whoa! W-What’s wrong, Fran?』</p>
<p>As soon as she came back from the white space, Fran suddenly hugged me. There were tears build up in the corners of Fran’s eyes as she crouched down.</p>
<p>What suddenly happened?</p>
<p>(Me too, I’d like to stay with Master forever. Because I’m my partner)</p>
<p>『Do you know that it was indeed a white space?』</p>
<p>(Nn. The Goddess of Chaos said she’ll let you see it)</p>
<p>『Seriously!?』</p>
<p>So this is the reason for that mischievous expression!</p>
<p>(Master, thanks.)</p>
<p>『Fran, we’ve been together forever』</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
<p>Aah, the old men were looking at us with strange looks. I thought they had defeated a dragon, but they suddenly began to hug it to the sword on that corpse, so I don’t blame them.</p>
<p>『Master』</p>
<p>『Fenrir-san! What should I say......?』</p>
<p>『You don’t have to worry about it. More importantly, neither Announcer-san nor I have fully recovered yet. There’s also an update to the system. It depends on the Goddess, but we’ll be asleep for a while again. Meanwhile, Fran and Urushi, please take care of us』</p>
<p>『Yeah. Of course』</p>
<p>『Okay, let’s meet again next time』</p>
<p>Fenrir-san’s presence then sank deep into me. She must have fallen asleep again.</p>
<p>In exchange for me to achieve my selfishness of staying here, I deprived Fenrir-san of the opportunity to wake up and Fran of her divine sword.</p>
<p>Both of them would have told us not to worry about it, but we couldn’t just accept it. We had to do our best for the sake of the two of them.</p>
<p>『Fran, let’s get together with the old men for now』</p>
<p>(Nn! Okay!)</p>
<p>Fran jumped off the corpse of the mountain dragon and spoke to Gamudo. He had already been healed, and aside from his armor, he didn’t seem to have any wounds on himself.</p>
<p>「What are you going to do now?」</p>
<p>「Oh? Oh, in the future? That’s right」</p>
<p>Gamudo’s eyes were wide open as Fran acted as usual, doing something that didn’t even happen to her hugging the sword.</p>
<p>However, she must have remembered that post-war treatment was important now.</p>
<p>What we were going to do with the corpse of a mountain dragon was going to be the main topic. After all, no one else was working anymore.</p>
<p>We searched for any scout or watchman, but there was no sign of anyone within our range of detection.</p>
<p>「I don’t need any other ingredients as long as I have more tongue, meat, and bones. Oh, and I’d love to have some motsu too」</p>
<p>「I wish I had a brain and a heart! I can’t throw away the horns too!」</p>
<p>「Okay, I’ll just use the scales!」</p>
<p>「Wait, Fran’s here too!」</p>
<p>I’d like to insist on a lot of things, but I think it’s better to give up this time.</p>
<p>「I can have a bite of meat with me」</p>
<p>「No no no no, I’ve put a stop to it, so I’d even say that I worked the hardest, right?」</p>
<p>That’s what Diaz said to me, but I had eaten some magic stones after all.</p>
<p>「Yup, I destroyed that magic stone after all」</p>
<p>「Hou? You mean the ability to erase all the magic stone soldiers?」</p>
<p>「I knew it would happen!」</p>
<p>Eiworth is looking very interested in us! Gamudo seemed to have expected half of it. Still, he must have entrusted the last one to Fran to make sure that he would kill the mountain dragons.</p>
<p>Thanks to that, I was able to reach self-evolution, and I also got some skills. Well, I still can’t use the Earth Dragon Magic, Dragonshout, Dragonscale Steel Form, and Dragonblood Flow skills I’ve gotten though.</p>
<p>Oh, Fran also had the title of 『Dragon Killer』. It seems that Announcer-san couldn’t do her job due to the Gods’ intervening. It had been posted on our site before I knew it.</p>
<p>「We don’t need materials now that we’ve run out of magic stones」</p>
<p>I wonder if that cute Fran was muttering these words soundly? If she were a good adult, I wonder if she could tell me to split the materials without worrying about it.</p>
<p>I was born several decades ago, it seems. Not that it means much to me considering how I don’t remember living that long myself.</p>
<p>But the old men were the same old men.</p>
<p>「Then, I’d like to try some of the best things about filet.」</p>
<p>「If I don’t need a little girl, then my brain and heart are mys!」</p>
<p>「I’ll get more scales from you! I’ll even have fangs if I can!」</p>
<p>「I want those fangs too!」</p>
<p>They started talking about how to split up into four groups. Well, that’s fine. Thanks to that, I was able to evolve myself.</p>
<p>Eiworth seemed to have come up with some kind of idea after the four of them were struggling to figure out what to do.</p>
<p>「That’s right! I shouldn’t need a decent magic tool to summon so many of them! If you want to bring it to me, I can give you the materials!」</p>
<p>「Wait, the country must definitely show interest in this. I can’t give in to anything, you know?」</p>
<p>「In the first place, does a magic tool exist to perform such a summoning?」</p>
<p>「It’s more of a credibility than an individual act, I guess?」</p>
<p>Certainly, a sacrifice would be necessary, but wouldn’t a magic tool be able to summon a monster of a mountain dragon’s caliber?</p>
<p>But we had an idea of who would make that possible.</p>
<p>「Under the command of the Western Duke, there is an alchemist named Ansel.」</p>
<p>「Hou? I’ve heard of him! I remember that he’s an alchemist who came to hear the names of the small nations of the south about ten years ago. I’m told that he’s going to do some research on the curses」</p>
<p>「Cursed?」</p>
<p>「Well, I was also interested in it and had done some research on it before. But it was terrifyingly inefficient. So, I gave up. The source of the curse was the power of curses caused by the negative emotions of living beings. By pointing at a curse that was not very strong by contract or spell, I can curse it. The curse power that a person who died while resenting the world is quite strong, but it is still not efficient because it requires a sacrifice」</p>
<p>「I heard that Ansel is researching a Divine Sword」</p>
<p>「Hou? Did you change your direction quite a bit? Well, that wouldn’t be strange though, since there were times when you would do research exactly as the Patron wanted」</p>
<p>「But if there is such an alchemist, do you mean that such an impossible summoning might continue in the future?」</p>
<p>「That’s terrible then!」</p>
<p>「The alchemist Ansel, huh? He seems to be a troublesome opponent」</p>
<p>This time, a soldier from the Kingdom of Shallus was sacrificed, but the Kingdom of Raidos could use slaves and people to call a magic beast as a sacrifice.</p>
<p>「Hmmm. Then we should leave it with me! Shouldn’t we find out how to repatriate it?」</p>
<p>「It doesn’t have to be you, right?」</p>
<p>「That’s right, Eiworth. We can give it to the researchers in the country」</p>
<p>「Guh...! Then I won’t be able to do any research on it!」</p>
<p>For now, can I just store the mountain dragons in my storage?</p>
