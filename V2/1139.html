</div><h1>Chapter 1139</h1><p>「Ave――He’s not gonna die! Who are you manipulating the undead? Scavenger?」</p>
<p>「No, no, no! That’s not it! I’ve defeated most of them! And woof throats should be a necromancy of evil energy. In that case, let’s consider ourselves as the substitute wickerman, third seat of the Black Skeleton Army!」</p>
<p>「The substitute wickerman.」</p>
<p>「As the name suggests, he’s a rather resilient man with the ability to transform the undead under his control into a survivor.」</p>
<p>「As the name suggests, he’s a rather resilient man with the ability to transform the undead under his control into a survivor.」</p>
<p>  As we had been told before we arrived at the battlefield, he was a type that used shield techniques to transfer damage. Moreover, it would be really troublesome if he could create long-term subordinates himself.  Fran had him explain it to the other adventurers once again, probably to make them aware of it.  The hole in Avenger’s stomach was already filled and he was moving around energetically. So, it wouldn’t be a problem. </p>
<p>「Aah, and the alias of Wickerman’s substitute is not just about his abilities!」</p>
<p>「What do you mean?」</p>
<p>  We’ve never heard of that either.  </p>
<p>「He’s also the Shadow Warrior of Nameless, the first seat of the group!  He also has an Appraisal Disguising skill!  I’m done!  Their appearances are very similar, so I thought it would be difficult to see through them.  Well, I guess it was obvious where it was! Fuhahahaha!」</p>
<p>  Avenger smiles happily while blocking the flame magic flying from the fort.  But isn’t this quite important information? Not only the abilities of his enemies, but also the shadow warriors of his enemy boss had been exposed.  </p>
<p>「The total number of the Zhu Flame Knights was supposed to be about 300, so there must be very little left in the fort.」</p>
<p>  In other words, the only things we needed to be careful of at that fort were the Zhu Flame Knights chief and Wickerman. After all, we should leave this place to someone else to attack the fort.  </p>
<p>「Maleficent!」</p>
<p>「We’re going with them!」</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>  Before Fran could say anything, Mareficent spoke with a serious look on his face. Persona nodded her head in agreement.  But could she support this battlefield where Durahan is springing up in large numbers without Mareficent?  Donadrond was too worn out to even use his defensive radiance anymore. The adventurers were trying their best, but their opponent was too tough. However, Mareficent wasn’t just trying to offend them, he seemed to have a decent idea of what they wanted.  </p>
<p>「The main idea is to have enough strength to save this place, right?  So, please wait just a moment. Oh, Persona, please heal Forrund-san」</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>「Forrund-san’s power is necessary.  Besides, that fort seems...  Please」</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p> Persona looked up at her partner as if she was asking something.  But for some reason, Mareficent bowed her head to her. She didn’t seem to be using telepathy, but they seemed to be communicating with each other.  Then Persona approached Forrund.  Forrund was too drained of his trump cards to make any flashy attacks with his sword. He managed to fight against Durahan, but it seemed unlikely that he would achieve anything more.  When he stood behind Forrund, he put his hands in front of his chest as if he was praying.  Naturally, the undead attacked him, but their barriers prevented everything. As I thought, Persona probably had a high level of warding skill.  As I watched over her with that in mind, a surprising scene unfolded.  </p>
<p>「Aah―...」</p>
<p>「!!  Persona spoke!」</p>
<p>『A-aah, yes.  And there’s a lot of magic power coming from it!』</p>
<p>  Persona, who had thought she couldn’t speak, uttered a thin, but cute voice from her mouth. Immediately after, an enormous amount of magic power covered her area.  It was swelling and raging magic that matches the word “swirling”. I see why I’m worried that I can’t control it.  Is it a “Raaaaah” song? For a few seconds, her voice echoed through the battlefield, and magic power danced in response to the song. Then, Forrund was enveloped in light.  </p>
<p>「This is...」</p>
<p> I could feel the magic power filling Forrund’s body.  It reminded me of Sophie’s magic song.  Unlike recovery magic, this was a power that could heal the opponent’s fundamental fatigue and exhaustion. It seemed that Persona also had the same kind of power. However, there seemed to be a reason why she didn’t use it casually.  </p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>「Persona, are you okay?」</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>  Persona hesitated for a moment, and Mareficent caught her and hugged her.  Apparently, she was so exhausted that she couldn’t stand. The waterfall-like sweat on her neck showed how exhausted she was.  It only took a few seconds to realize that... I guess there was a reason why she didn’t usually talk. </p>
<p>「Persona had done his best too, so I’ll have to do his best too」</p>
<p> With Persona in her arms, Mareficent stepped forward this time.  </p>
<p>「Well then...」</p>
<p>「...!」</p>
<p>  Everyone around them, who had been watching over them as they fought, gasped in surprise.  To their surprise, Mareficent slowly bit into his wrist and devoured them violently.  Of course, a large amount of blood flowed and soaked their feet in red. But that was exactly what Mareficent was aiming for.  His blood did not penetrate the earth, it flowed unnaturally to create something like a pattern. It was a magical circle about three meters in diameter.  </p>
<p>「I will give you my blood.  Answer the call, great demon!  summon!」</p>

<p> Apparently, Mareficent could use a demon. From within the blood magic circle, I could see a being wearing a strong magical power was about to appear.</p>
