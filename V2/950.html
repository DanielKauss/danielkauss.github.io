</div><h1>Chapter 950</h1><p>After we got the information about Alpha, we asked her for more details about the other Divine Swords. Next to Alpha, we’ll also be interested in Berserk. </p>
<p>「The Mad God’s Sword, Berserk, is possessed and managed by an organization called the Monthly Beauty under the command of the Militant Nation of Hagane」</p>
<p>「Monthly Beauty?」</p>
<p>『It’s the name of the flower that scatters all night long』</p>
<p> It was a beautiful, but also sinister name. </p>
<p>「There was a girl named Hydrangea and Songyu. Are they the beauty below the moon?」</p>
<p> They were the beauty below the moon?」</p>
<p>「Could it be that they were Berserk’s wielders created by the Militant Nation of Hagane」</p>
<p>「Was it made?」</p>
<p>「Yes.  Homunculus, created by a mixture of the first bloodline and the blood of the best people. It is the divine swordsman of the younger beautiful women.」</p>
<p>  Rather than raising her as a wielder of the divine sword, she has created a homunculus for that!  But why is that so?  Wasn’t it better to train people of aptitude like Addel? After understanding our doubts, the Silver Lady explained further. </p>
<p>「Have you ever heard of Berserk’s wielder dying?」</p>
<p>「Nn.  There is.」</p>
<p>「But it seems that the first wielder never died out of control, no matter how bad they are」</p>
<p>「Is that so?」</p>
<p>「Yes.」</p>
<p>It seems that the Berserk’s restriction was deeply related to this story.  Originally, Berserk had the restriction that only the first wielder and their bloodline could use. If anything that didn’t leak blood for a long time was in contact with it, that alone would kill it. However, that was when a big problem came up.  The first bloodline had been cut off for various reasons. War, an epidemic, an assassination, and those who decided not to leave any blood behind.  The country that possessed Berserk at that time fell into a great chaos.  It was only natural that they suddenly became unable to use their best forces. In the end, the country was destroyed by internal war and foreign melancholy. Later, along with researchers and royalty, the Militant Nation of Hagane took in the personnel of that country.  At that time, Hagane, who was still the only country belonging to Silard and was on the exploitative side, secretly advanced Berserk’s research and developed a way to manage it. Then, he used his power to break out of Silard’s control. As a result, the Berserk Operation and research organization, which was made up of people from the exile country, had gained a special status within the Militant Nation of Hagane. However, perhaps because he is not a complete child, he is always able to use Berserk, but he will always die after that」</p>
<p>  So, the restriction worked halfway through.  He could touch it and use the Divine Sword Release, but it was impossible to survive like the first generation. I don’t know why they’re all old people.  But they don’t talk so much in vain」</p>
<p>  Disgusting imagination even made me think of things that would throw them aside... And I was impressed by the motivation of the old soldiers.  </p>
<p>「The restrictions of Berserk are outbursts and blood binding.  Their abilities are enhanced with stronger stats than Alpha. He can also draw out the talent and potential of the person」</p>
<p>「You mean that the talent he has has has has different power to be strengthened?」</p>
<p>「Yes. Therefore, it is unknown what kind of abilities will be drawn by each wielder」</p>
<p>  Even if they are drawing the same blood, their talents and abilities will not be exactly the same. If that was the case, did she mean that a beautiful female Divine Sword user below the moon would not know what kind of abilities she would have until she released her sword?  Moreover, if she uses it, she will die every time she uses it.  In other words, the abilities that she will unleash are different. I guess that meant that they couldn’t handle it as an enemy?  I now understand why Silard, who had Alpha, avoided an all-out war with the Hagane Militant Nation. If he wasn’t careful, there was a good chance that there would be monsters that couldn’t be easily defeated even by Alpha.  Moreover, Alpha was weakened during the battle and would die at worst. So, there was no benefit to it.  </p>
<p>「Please be careful not to get caught up in it when using it」</p>
<p>「... Nn」</p>
<p> Fran’s excitement visibly decreased after thinking about the hydrangea.  </p>
<p>「I don’t know the cost of using Berserk.  The homunculus and the others that you used will die after all」</p>
<p>「I see...  Hey, what’s the cost of using Gaia and Ignis? Are you okay?」</p>
<p>  After hearing that much, she was worried about the cost of using other Divine Swords.  In particular, she was worried whether the life of the Divine Sword users she knew would be okay. She mentioned Gaia and Ignis’ names that the Silver Lady had information about. However, the Silver Lady did not change her expression, but she shook her head apologetically.  </p>
<p>「I’m sorry. Both Gaia and Ignis have not had enough information about the price.」</p>
<p>  Both Ashwrath and Isario seemed to have minimized their wear and tear by using the Divine Sword as much as possible. Therefore, it was not clear what kind of price they were paying. Many of the information about Alpha and Berserk was gathered from the conversations with their companions and subordinates. It must be surprisingly difficult to gather information about Ashwrath and the others, who were basically soloists.  </p>
<p>「However, there is a high possibility that the Divine Sword of the first Divine-level blacksmith, Ulmer, would be a similar price. In fact, Klisterus and Tempest were the same price as Alpha」</p>
<p> I get the impression that the Divine Swords made by Ulmer had many versatile and easy-to-use Divine Swords. This was in direct contrast to Dionys, their younger brother, who was constantly making evil and powerful divine swords.  </p>
<p>「So, the level of Ignis and Gaia will be the price to pay for them?」</p>
<p>「I think so.  It’s just a prediction though」</p>
<p>  And she also taught me the abilities of Ignis and Gaia. Well, it was just as expected though, since we had shown her Gaia before and Gallus had taught us Ignis’s ability before it was released.  Gaia was the land, Ignis was the fire, Klitterus was the water, and tempest was the wind. It was a Divine Sword that specialized in these attributes and gave the user the power to manipulate them.  In addition, by imbuing Divine Attributes, even if it was resistant, it could pass damage. It could be said that it had all-around abilities that could be used in melee, long-range, physical, and magic.  Incidentally, it was almost a thousand years ago that Klistalos was last observed on the continent of Gordicia. The tempest seemed to be happening even earlier, and the current owner did not know about it.  Klistaros’ shape was a blue and white serber.  He might use a color similar to mine.  I felt a little familiar with him.  But when I released it, it was said to be an amorphous like water or fog. I guess it was Ignis’ water version.  The tempest was a green-based stock, and it seemed to be a little more luxurious after it was released.The tempest was a green-based stock, and it seemed to be a little more luxurious after it was released.  However, by separating the blades into countless pieces like a locket pen, and by connecting the invisible sword bodies between them, they could be used like a whip.  A wind whip that shattered the earth and defeated a large army with a single blow.  It was usually terrifying for Amanda’s whip, but I guess it would be far more powerful than that if it was a Divine Sword.The tempest was a green-based stock, and it seemed to be a little more luxurious after it was released.

I had just seen the tremendous power of Ignis, so both Klisterus and Tempest must be terrifying without losing.</p>
