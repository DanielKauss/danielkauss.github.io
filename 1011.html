</div><h1>Chapter 1011</h1><p>The woman’s voice echoed in my head, without any attempt to hide her hostility or malice towards us. It was clearly telepathy. </p>
<p>「...Juanaverta?」</p>
<p>『Don’t call me a rude little girl! You can give me that sword! Trismegistus-sama is here to order me to do it, right?』</p>
<p>「I’ll refuse.」</p>
<p>『...Then I’ll kill you and take you away! You can take away the power from the remnants!』</p>
<p> The effect of the original sin of jealousy seemed to be fine even if I was destroyed. She seemed to have a wider range of beings that could be used as skills than skill takers. She seemed to have a wider range of beings that could be used as skills than skill takers.  </p>
<p>『What should we do?  Master and what do you want to do? She said it was good at information analysis, but it seemed that they had seen through our information more than I had imagined.  </p>
<p>『Aah, how jealous...!  How much fearsome power does that poor sword have!?  That’s how much evil power it has! And that possibility of growth even though it was a sword!』</p>
<p>『Looks like you can see a lot of things inside of me.』</p>
<p>『Of course!  I’m one with Trismegistus-sama! I can see everything my king sees!』</p>
<p>「The man has a skill called Dragon Eye.  It seems to be a rather powerful skill that allows him to see into the true nature of things.  Moreover, Trismegistus is unable to leave the castle, but all the abilities inside have increased. All of my Divine Swords must have been completely stripped off!」</p>
<p>  Hearing Isario’s words, I was convinced.  The feeling I felt when he was staring at me was like seeing through someone else. That must be the feeling of using the dragonkin.  To be able to see through the abilities of a Divine Sword was at least higher than my Heavenly Eye.  And it seemed that she was able to share her eyes with Fanaverta.  </p>
<p>「Are the pieces of the Evil Gods the Divine Beast and its labyrinth?  It doesn’t seem to be a Divine Sword, but I can’t believe it」</p>
<p>『You mean you’re seeing everything!』</p>
<p>「Oi oi, young miss, Master.  Are you sure?」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>「Outta of nowhere...」</p>
<p>  Isario, the wielder of the Divine Sword, was drawing her attention.  Well, to put it bluntly, it was definitely something inside of me. Even Merritte, who was closing in behind me, looked at me with a terrifying look.  </p>
<p>『Then, don’t you understand? If you destroy me, the Evil God might resurrect you, right?』</p>
<p>  This should be our greatest threat because he saw right through me. If we resurrect the pieces of the Evil Gods here, even Juanaverta and Trismegistus would not be safe.  They may not die because they were immortal, but if they knew that they would resurrect the Evil Gods, they might be punished by heaven. However, Juanaverta laughed loudly.  </p>
<p>『Ahahahaha!  Well, that’s not for you!』</p>
<p> The beautiful voice made me feel the hidden malice in each part of her body.  </p>
<p>『You don’t know anything about yourself, do you?  Kufufu.  When the sword is destroyed, the pieces of the Divine Beast and the Evil God are set up to disappear against each other.  I guess it’s a safety device. It’s a very powerful technique, so I knew right away』</p>
<p>  I didn’t know how Trismegistus’ eyes looked at me, but he seemed to know the systemic part.I didn’t know how Trismegistus’ eyes looked at me, but it seemed that he knew the systemic part.  Even Alistair, a Divine-level blacksmith, didn’t really understand that much.  Even if I was to break, I would never be able to be destroyed for Fenrir-san’s sake.  The only problem was that I couldn’t use my biggest threat anymore.  Besides, is my equipment’s restrictions exposed now that I’ve been recognized so well? Can I somehow convince her to use the method of making her equipment? Juanaverta laughed even more as he told her that he could see through my thought.  </p>
<p>『Kyahahaha!  It seems that if anyone other than that little girl equips them, the lower-ranking Divine Punishment will be triggered, but I’m not sure about that! Understood!』</p>
<p>  She didn’t like what she said.  Besides, madness was emanating from every corner of her tone.  We were able to talk just in time, but if they asked me if I was crazy, I could only assume that I was crazy.  Isn’t this treated as something that doesn’t go crazy? Well, it’s better than Fanatics though...  </p>
<p>『It’s a sword, but there’s a possibility I can grow on my own!  Amazing!  If I take away its power, I’ll be able to stay forever!  Help Trismegistus-sama forever!  It’s a shame to have a sword like that!  As the best sword in the world, the sprout of that possibility is worthy of my sword! So, bring it on!』</p>
<p>「Master is the best sword in the world!」</p>
<p>『Aaah?  What is it?』</p>
<p>「I’m not the best in the world, you know!」</p>
<p>『I’ve stopped being kind to you anymore.  I’ll kill you and destroy the sword! I’ve already decided!』</p>
<p>「That’s what they say」</p>
<p>  Trismegistus held up a Silver Falcion in response to his beloved sword.  It was completely at Franaverta’s mercy.  It was just like a doll with no subjectivity.  </p>
<p>『Fran.  I can’t beat this immortal being. Can you understand?』</p>
<p>「... Nn」</p>
<p>『I’m going to run. I know how frustrated you are, but I don’t have any chance of winning.』</p>
<p>(...... Okay.)</p>
<p>  As soon as she had made the decision to run away, Fran made a quick switch. She jumped backwards to keep her distance from Trismegistus.  However, her movements had been exposed.  </p>
<p>「Hmm?  I’m not letting you go.」</p>
<p>『Tch!』</p>
<p>  Trismegistus had closed the distance at once. As he said, he probably intended to avoid running. However, there was a lump of fire that rushed towards Trismegistus at a tremendous pace.  Trismegistus held up his hand to try to block it, but it burst forth and filled the surrounding area with flames. The only people not burned were Isario and Fran.  </p>
<p>「Isario?」</p>
<p>「Miss Hilt...  Run. I’ll buy you some time.」</p>
<p>「!」</p>
<p>  Fran was surprised, but Isario shrugged his shoulders and shouted lightly.  </p>
<p>「You’re a Rank S adventurer, aren’t you?  I can handle it by myself. So, go!」</p>
<p>「... Okay」</p>
<p>  Fran hesitated for a moment, but she nodded immediately. Looking at the resolve in Isario’s eyes, she must have been unable to waste her determination. Besides, she knew that if Isario was going to fight seriously, she would be a hindrance.  Fran narrowed her words down in frustration.</p>
<p>「I know.」</p>
