</div><h1>Chapter 1022</h1><p>Ashwrath put his strength into the hands of the Earth Sword, Gaia, as he glared at the giant antidemons that fell from the sky. The muscles he exerted are rising and expanding. His originally muscular body was now like a muscle mass.</p>
<p>Twisted body, his huge hammer-like head held up to the ground so that it wouldn’t snap. Could it be similar to a backswing from playing tennis?</p>
<p>In that state, I could see that he was concentrating his magic power on the Divine Sword. Ashwrath was apparently planning to intercept the giant antidemons.</p>
<p>The two radiated a kind of super energy that was nowhere near as powerful as our feet. I wonder what kind of demise that collision would bring.</p>
<p>『Run, run!』</p>
<p>I urged Fran to hurry. I urged her to hurry. Even though we had gotten a lot farther away, my danger detection was still ringing.</p>
<p>A few seconds into the run, Fran felt slow, even though she was supposed to be at full speed. That much frustration was making me panic.</p>
<p>We’ve already caught up with Orfalve and Jayne.</p>
<p>「Guys! Let’s get out of here!」</p>
<p>「That’s already impossible! Shield user! Get to the front!」</p>
<p>「「「Yeah!」」」</p>
<p>Fran decided to stay here with them. She paused behind the dwarves.</p>
<p>『Fran! Let’s use Resonance Magic!』</p>
<p>(Got it!)</p>
<p>We resonated with flame magic and wind magic. It wasn’t an attack, but a defensive spell.</p>
<p>Flame barrier that blocked flame heat and wind shield that blocked wind. By resonated with each other, they created a huge wall to weaken the blast.</p>
<p>Even if we can’t completely block it, we can still help the dwarven shield army if we weaken it a little.</p>
<p>「A wide area impact barrier!」</p>
<p>Furthermore, Seliadot deployed a huge barrier. It seems she was quietly building up her power so that she could respond in times of need.</p>
<p>Just right after our Resonance Magic and Seliadot’s wards formed a double wall in front of the dwarves.</p>
<p>It seems that a meteor had fallen.</p>
<p>The fact that his movements seemed to have slowed down just before he collided with the earth was probably due to Ashwrath’s intercept.</p>
<p>Still, he was unable to completely repel it.</p>
<p>A tremendous explosion then occurred, with flashes of light, shockwaves, and rubble cleaning the ground.</p>
<p>Our wall was destroyed in an instant. Seliadot’s wards held on a little, but they still couldn’t hold on for a second. The magic shields that the dwarves thrust out were also shattered off in an instant. But even so, the dwarves managed to hold on.</p>
<p>We poured all our magic power into it to somehow prevent the shield from being completely destroyed. After a few seconds of fierce competition, the storm in the area subsided.</p>
<p>The dwarven shield army was so worn out that not a single person could stand properly, that they collapsed on the spot. However, thanks to that, there was no serious damage.</p>
<p>Some of them were injured from the rubble that came down, but no one died. The demonkin moved quickly, healing all the injured.</p>
<p>Leaving the first aid to them, we immediately blew away the dust around us with wind magic in preparation for the attack of the giant antidemons. A surprising scene then came to our eyes.</p>
<p>The earth had been heavily gouged out. The only place where we stood was safe thanks to the dwarves, but the surrounding area was a notch below ground, as if we had dug into it with heavy equipment.</p>
<p>That continued for a long time. In fact, the place where we were now seemed to be a notch higher than the surroundings.</p>
<p>The shockwave must have greatly shattered the ground. But it was much better than the blast zone.</p>
<p>It had a huge hole that made it look like a circular pillar that had been deeply thrust into the earth and pulled out.</p>
<p>The antidemons must have focused most of the impact of the collision on us.</p>
<p>If this energy had been more distributed around us, we would not have been able to escape either.</p>
<p>And the most important ones were the giant antidemons that had fallen a little further away from the large hole. Their bodies, which had been straight like a full moon, had been crushed and gouged, and from here, the crescent moon had fallen to the earth.</p>
<p>About 70% of its volume has been lost, hasn’t it? The core has disappeared with some of its surface parts still intact.</p>
<p>However, it still hadn’t lost its magic power. It must have already begun to regenerate itself.</p>
<p>Ashwrath, on the other hand, was lying right next to the large hole. His entire body was scorched and motionless.</p>
<p>「Ashwrath!」</p>
<p>We rushed over to check it and found that it was barely alive. It had lost one of its arms and its lower half of its body was crushed.</p>
<p>But it would save me if I was still alive. In the first place, my regeneration had already started. However, we need to hurry to heal her now. With the determination to use up all of our magic power, we just kept on using our healing magic.</p>
<p>「...The light of the horns has stopped.」</p>
<p>『Yeah, it was a close call...』</p>
<p>The horns on Ashwrath’s fallen forehead turned reddish and glistening. He must have been on the verge of master’s death, due to which his Mad Ogre activation was about to take effect.</p>
<p>It seems that she stopped after her wounds had healed.</p>
<p>『I don’t know what will happen if Ashwrath rampages now.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>I’d be fine as long as Ashwrath was willing to attack and defeat the giant antidemons. But that would not be a good idea.</p>
<p>It would be more likely for them to attack our forces and cause significant damage.</p>
<p>If that had happened, our friends would have been annihilated, and the antidemons would have been fully resurrected.</p>
<p>『Fran, let’s go too. We’ll have to defeat it here, or we’ll be in a lot of trouble』</p>
<p>We didn’t even know if Ashwrath would be able to fight again after waking up. We had to put a stop to him right now.</p>
<p>Leaving Ashwrath to the adventurers approaching us, Fran joined up with the dwarves. But the barrage did not go as planned.</p>
<p>They were not ready yet, and were in shortage of fire to destroy the antidemons. The situation was the same as when Ader first came forward.</p>
<p>Even Mea and Zelos Reed, who we had been relying on, were blown away by the blast and had no idea where they were. I didn’t think they were dead, but...</p>
<p>All the army was starting to show signs of impatience. The speed at which the giant antidemons healed was beginning to exceed our attacks.</p>
<p>Once he was fully recovered, I really had no more choice. What would I do? The only way I could come up with a counterattack was to let Sophie escape on her own and intercept the giant antidemons in Nocta, where she could use the adventurer’s song.</p>
<p>I’m sure many people will die, but there is no other strategy that could win.</p>
<p>As I was thinking about this, a girl came down from the carriage. It looked as if the soldiers had taken their lives to protect her, so there was almost no damage.</p>
<p>Yes, I forgot about her.</p>
<p>「Hydrangea」</p>
<p>「You, you kid. I’ll leave the rest to you」</p>
<p>「...Understood」</p>
<p>「...Please leave it to me」</p>
<p>「Maybe it’ll get you involved. I’m sorry.」</p>
<p>The hydrangea bowed its head to the surrounding dwarves and demonkin in an out-of-place, carefree manner. Then, it pulled out its divine sword.</p>
<p>「Hydrangea!」</p>
<p>「Fran. I’m leaving here. In order to bring Berserk back to his country, we have to defeat him. I’ll put a stop to him」</p>
