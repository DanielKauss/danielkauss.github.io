</div><h1>Chapter 1039</h1><p>My name is Juanaverta.</p>
<p>He was in the service of the great Dragon King, Trismegistus-sama. I would even say he had the upper hand in the stomach.</p>
<p>Ah, how pitiful my king is.</p>
<p>Trismegistus-sama always smiled in trouble and said that he was a member of his kin. He could not leave that stupid dragonkin behind, despite their arrogance and pride.</p>
<p>Trismegistus-sama, who does not like to fight, was looked down on. They did not even try to hide his attitude.</p>
<p>And yet, after learning of her alchemy talent, she approached us as if she had turned her palm back.</p>
<p>A thick-faced, shameless man. He’s greedy, frivolous, and incapable of anything but combat. That is the dragonkin. My Lord is a race among them, and the only one exception.</p>
<p>The Lord had told us many times before that he would abandon them and leave the country, but he nodded his head.</p>
<p>Because I was king. I had to work for the people......</p>
<p>That kingship was imposed on the dragonkin. Trismegistus-sama, who had been quietly saying that she wanted to do research, was a royalty that binds his country and makes effective use of it.</p>
<p>That serious person could not refuse if he was told to do so for the sake of the people. He said that it was the decision of who was born into the King’s Golden Dragon.</p>
<p>So, after taking care of many useless people, my Lord will spread a number of groundbreaking magic tools throughout the country.</p>
<p>A magic tool that keeps the room temperature constant. A magic tool that instantly washes the scales and body. A magic tool for storing food.</p>
<p>Life became more prosperous, but the dragonkin’s desires did not stop. Now that they had more food, clothes, and shelter, their next battle would begin.</p>
<p>I mainly approached them to make useful magic tools for the battlefield. Magic tools for watching from a distance. Magic tools for digging holes. Magic tools for blocking walls.</p>
<p>That demand grew day by day, and the Lord responded to it with his genius brain and devoted research.</p>
<p>Some may call it the Golden Age of the Dragonkin, but that was ridiculous. It was the most fearsome and frustrating time when the dragonkin’s endless desires were supported by their master alone.</p>
<p>At that time, my Lord had begun to participate in battle. The dragonkin had forcibly carried me out. He had the foolish idea of using him as a hostage to fight, or as expected, he wouldn’t be able to take the throne.</p>
<p>I followed closely and built up a mountain of countless corpses. I guess it was around this time that I started giving myself the nickname of “Coldblooded Witch” and “Savage Swordsman”.</p>
<p>But no matter how well I did it, I was still an elf. In Gordicia at that time, elves were treated like dragonkin servants. Dragon shit never allowed me to be next to a king.</p>
<p>She had used all her might to separate me from the Lord, and had been harassing him in all likelihood. At times, she even pulled herself apart from the Lord on the battlefield and put him in danger.</p>
<p>Well, the dragonkin who made the false report killed him in a reasonably bad way to show off. After half of him was iced, he spent about seven days slowly peeling off the scales and debilitating himself. That thing was worth watching.</p>
<p>But that didn’t mean the harassment was over. The dragonkin had no choice but to shove their daughter into the Lord’s office. They seemed to think I was a hindrance.</p>
<p>It was not coming down. There was no such thing as affection between a man and a woman between me and Trismegistus-sama. It was not an emotion that conveniently misunderstood survival instinct and lust, but pure loyalty that I harbor.</p>
<p>Only loyalty, like a Kongo stone, that does not change at all, is moving me. So, if the king is going to marry a queen, let’s welcome it. The Darkness of the Obon apparently didn’t seem to understand that. I don’t like the stupidity of not being able to measure it on his own.</p>
<p>Then one day, I was attacked by several dragonkin and suffered a serious injury on the verge of death. It seems there was a life dragonkin here, so even recovery magic did not close my wounds.</p>
<p>As a result, I became the subject of some research. It was the creation of an intelligence weapon.</p>
<p>Originally, our research was on creating a sword with a human soul implant, which would give us advice on the battlefield. However, we couldn’t create something satisfactory in terms of performance, so we shifted in the direction of taking in humans directly...</p>
<p>After several experiments with slaves, their spirits were broken, which did not go well. It must be that harsh for a human spirit to dwell in a sword.</p>
<p>But I shouldn’t die. I have to stay next to Trismegistus-sama for good.</p>
<p>As a result, the experiment was successful. Before I knew it, I had acquired the skill “Devotion”, which seemed to be what gave my mind vitality and prevented me from going crazy.</p>
<p>However, it was not perfect. I could feel my heart gradually wear out. So, before I could properly defend myself, I would have to solidify Trismegistus-sama’s status.</p>
<p>Trismegistus-sama must have been aware of my condition as well. He wanted to achieve the goal of shutting up the other dragonkin before I went crazy.</p>
<p>And as a result, that tragedy came to shove.</p>
<p>I feel sorry for overworking them when it came to that. I was the one who had to warn them about this, but I’ve incited them instead. My ability to judge must have been dulled by the fact that I transformed into a sword.</p>
<p>But the real tragedy for me came after this.</p>
<p>As an Immortal Sinner, I will keep fighting the Abyss Eater that I create. It was the punishment of the Lord, and I was given the role of watching over it.</p>
<p>My Commitment skill evolved into the “Permanent Loyalty” skill, allowing me to exist again for eternity.</p>
<p>However, continuing to see the mutating Lord over a long period of time was exactly like torture.</p>
<p>「Juanaverta... you saved us for today too. I look forward to working with you tomorrow.」</p>
<p>『Please leave it to us』</p>
<p>「Yeah. I’m glad you’re here.」</p>
<p>「Juanaverta, let’s go. Shake her power to the fullest.」</p>
<p>『Yeah! Let’s do our best』</p>
<p>「Yeah, you’re right」</p>
<p>「Juanaverta, let’s go!」</p>
<p>『My Lord, do not push yourself too hard』</p>
<p>「Yeah」</p>
<p>Gradually, the conversation faded, the words that responded to her lost their fervor, and the expressions on their faces. The prison of time was more brutal and terrifying than most people had imagined.</p>
<p>Still, my loyalty does not falter. I will continue to support her. That incident had changed my mind.</p>
<p>It was a battle with divine swordsmen wielding poison and demon power. It seems that the man was stupidly aiming for Trismegistus-sama’s eternal life. The foolish man, who could not even tell the horror of living forever, seemed to be quite important to us.</p>
<p>Considering the nature of the skill, the source of jealousy, she thought we could take it away, but she couldn’t really touch the Divine Punishment.</p>
<p>As a result, I turned to my skill. I thought that, even if it was not immortal, it could be a threat. That was why I took away my eternal loyalty.</p>
<p>That was a skill that someone forced me to pledge allegiance to, but I wonder what happened to that man? In my case, I was more loyal to Trismegistus-sama than before. So, there was no problem with it...</p>
<p>Well, I don’t mind such a thing. Instead of losing my eternal loyalty, I was forced into the source of my jealousy on an equivalent exchange.</p>
<p>From then on, it began even worse. I had no control over my mind, and I couldn’t believe what I was screaming. Moreover, little by little, my skills and I became more and more comfortable with it.</p>
<p>Gradually, my jealousy filled me with the thought that I wanted to erase this ugly and incompetent me, and I was pushed deeper into the world.</p>
<p>And then that time came.</p>
<p>『Trismegistus-sama! I have magic power on my blade! Please! If things continue like this――』</p>
<p>I screamed ugly. But soon afterwards, that emotion vanished.</p>
<p>『Gyaaaaaaahhh!』</p>
<p>Along with the feeling of myself being preyed on, my mind regained its composure. The destruction of my mind must have weakened the effects of my jealousy’s original sin.</p>
<p>Ah, thank you very much. My Lord, with this, I can disappear... But will I be fine without me? I can’t help but be worried that that fake Intelligence Weapons would be able to support you.</p>
<p>But was this the memory of this sword that flowed into me as if it was a replacement for my consciousness that had faded from earlier? The memory of our trip with the girl was dense, smiling, and full of hope.</p>
<p>Aah, this is...... jealous―.</p>
