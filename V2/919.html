</div><h1>Chapter 919</h1><p>Sophie and Urushi appeared alongside with many people. Her――No, their song covered the entire battlefield. An adventurer’s song was sung by thousands of people. Space? The air? Anyway, the entire battlefield slowly healed Fran and Mea’s wounds with a faint golden light as if it was responding to the song. Ignoring even the effects of the divine attribute, I, Fran, and Mea were beginning to recover. They were probably due to this magical power that had the divine attribute. I guess it was because of this magical power that the divine attribute was possessed. The antidemons, on the other hand, were pausing their movements in confusion. With their entire bodies enveloped in powerful magical power, they don’t seem to know what to do.  It’s probably the same as when an artificial intelligence bugged in an unexpected situation and stopped moving.  That was happening on the entire battlefield. The effect was terrifying.  </p>
<p>「Sophie!  Urushi!」</p>
<p>「I’m sorry for being late! But I’ve brought you a reassuring reinforcement!」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>  Many people were standing behind Sophie and Sophie as they smiled.  They were wearing ordinary clothes. Some of them were wearing armor on top of it, but most of them were just wearing pots.  They had various weapons, not only rusted spears and swords, but also pans and horned materials. Moreover, they were not wearing them at all.  By all accounts, they were ordinary citizens.  However, they were standing in line behind Sophie with brave expressions on their faces. I wondered why I was so reliable just by looking at them.  There were so many people willing to stand on the battlefield with us.  That was the fact that was important.  </p>
<p>『Nice job, Urushi! Urushi!  It’s a reward for us later!』</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>  But it wasn’t just them that caught my eyes. Fran looked around Sophie and tilted her head. </p>
<p>「Sophie, what’s that?」</p>
<p>「My......  partner, I guess?」</p>
<p>  Countless instruments were floating around Sophie as she smiled as she said those words.  A keyed instrument, a string instrument, and a percussion instrument.  Some of them looked strange. Ability to control instruments?  However, all instruments were emitting tremendous magical power. Combined with all of them, they would be far beyond mine.  Not an extraordinary magical tool.  Could it be the Earth Sword Gaia that emitted the closest magical power I’ve ever seen? However, I didn’t feel an intimidating atmosphere here.  Wait, I guess?  Isn’t this instrument emitting a slight divine attribute? Immediately after I realized that, Sophie mentioned the true nature of the instrument.  </p>
<p>「It’s called the Oratrio, the Divine Sword......  The Saintess Sword Oratrio.」</p>
<p>『Huh?!  And the Divine Sword?』</p>
<p> I quickly appraised it and it definitely said Oratrio. Name: Saintess Sword, Oratorio Attack: 1000 Mana Conductivity: 30000 Durability: 30000 Mana Conductivity: SS Skill Playing Effect: Super-High, instrument summoning, choir effect super-enhancement, effect range super-enhancement, steel thread enhancement, steel thread manipulation, divine finger, superb pitch, simultaneous performance, I couldn’t see everything that was unknown.  However, I could tell that its ability was extraordinary. It had less attack power than the Earth Sword Gaia I’d seen before, but I’m sure it was only natural for an instrument.  Rather, it had a thousand of it, so how to attack it?  How to deal with a duller? Also, its magic conductivity would be a notch lower.  In contrast to its low attack power and magic conductivity, this Divine Sword had 10,000 times higher magic power than Gaia’s.  Combined with its wide variety of skills, there was no doubt that it was the same Divine Sword as Gaia. This was certainly a divine sword.  </p>
<p>「Did you have a divine sword?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. I forgot about it a while ago, but it reminded me.」</p>
<p> When I checked Sophie’s stats previously, there was a part with■■■■. It seems the Divine Sword Release skill was in there. What we didn’t see was not concealing it, but that Sophie had lost her memory. </p>
<p>「I’m sure there’s a lot I want to ask you, but now you need to fight antidemons!」</p>
<p>「Nn. Okay.」</p>
<p>「Fuhahaha!  I never thought she was a Divine Sword user! As reliable as hell!」</p>
<p>「Saintess-sama and a divine swordsman......  That’s amazing.」</p>
<p>  Now they had enough time to talk to Mea and Velmeria again. Sophie spoke to these girls with a serious look on her face.  </p>
<p>「The antidemons have stopped moving now, but I’m quickly getting used to them and starting to move. So, I’d like to use my trump card......」</p>
<p>「Trump card? It’s not an oratrio?」</p>
<p>「Isn’t the power of my magic song amplified by Oracle’s power?」</p>
<p>  It seems Sophie had more than just the ability to write existing songs. She could also manipulate the music of an ordinary song that already existed and turn it into a magic song. The emotions contained in the song could also have an effect that even Sophie could not imagine. </p>
<p>「I transformed an adventurer’s song into a magical song」</p>
<p>「You recovered from that song just a moment ago?」</p>
<p>「Can there be another song with the same song? Besides, the song was made to heal people just a little while ago, but that’s not the true power of the song」</p>
<p> Sophie was planning to write a new magic song that was the same song but had a different effect.  </p>
<p>「The thoughts contained in the adventurer’s song are rooting for and inspireing others」</p>
<p> The new magic song is said to have the power to wake up and awaken the blood and soul of her friends. Apparently, it would be a song that would give someone a Potential Release.  </p>
<p>「But the intensity of the people’s thoughts contained in this song exceeded my imagination. I don’t know how much power it will exert」</p>
<p>  Fran and Urushi were sure to be strengthened. But I couldn’t even imagine how much of a burden that would put on them.  </p>
<p>「You may not be able to sleep for a few days. Is that really okay?」</p>
<p> To be honest, I’m still worried, but everyone knows that the only way we can fight the antidemons here and now is to rely on their songs.  </p>
<p>「Nn.  Okay, okay?」</p>
<p>「Don’t come!」</p>
<p>「Understood」</p>
<p>「If you want a young lady...」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Quoof!」</p>
<p>  All of them nodded instantly.  </p>
<p>「...... Then I’ll go.  I’ll count on you to― No, that’s not it. Let’s all protect it!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  Sophie pulled out a harp from her oratrio and started playing it.  The song was the song of the adventurer from a while ago. The magic contained in it was probably more important than the song itself.  </p>
<p>「We are adventurers~... ♪ The golden adventurers~...♪」</p>
<p>「No foe shall make us falter!」</p>
<p>  The people reacted to Sophie’s song and sang it again. They were getting used to it, and soon all of them heard her voice. It seemed that a rain of singing voice would seep into our minds.  </p>
<p>『Somehow, I’m starting to love this song too』</p>
<p>(Me too)</p>
<p>  I felt excited.  But that was not all.  </p>
<p>「I’m starting to sense my power!」</p>
<p> So, this was the power of Oratrio’s skill!  I could feel the presence emanating from Fran skyrocketed.  This pressure... I was reminded of Ashwrath and Weena Rhyn. Moreover, wasn’t the power of the Divine Attribute increasing more and more? </p>
<p>「Uuh......!」</p>
<p>『Fran!  Are you okay!?』</p>
<p>  Fran grunted bitterly.  I could see that her magic power was raging wildly within her.  Was this what she felt with the song!? Thanks to Sophie, I’ve regained my strength and magic power, but was the burden really great?  </p>
<p>「Is this what kind of power is this......?」</p>
<p>『Fran?』</p>
<p>「Master, I know......!  My words come out of my head!」</p>
<p> Fran muttered as if she was in a fever. </p>
<p>「It’s the raging power of the Divine Beast that lies in my blood...」</p>
<p>With Fran’s firm words, an enormous amount of Divine Attribute-based magic power was emanating from her body.</p>
