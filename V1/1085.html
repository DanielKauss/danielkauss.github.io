</div><h1>Chapter 1085</h1><p>《The effect of self-evolution has been activated. 100 self-evolution points have been earned》</p>
<p>『Alright! It’s been a while since I’ve evolved myself!』</p>
<p>「Master, congratulations!」</p>
<p>『Yeah! Thanks!』</p>
<p>After all, the antidemons on the Gordicia continent did not have magic stones, and the Potential Release had greatly reduced their magic stone value.</p>
<p>I thought it would take me a longer time, but thanks to the bonus stage, I was able to evolve myself at once.</p>
<p>Moreover, my self-evolution points were bad. Because Fenrir-san had lost his power, there were few points I could get when I evolved for a while. I haven’t gotten many points in a while. I wonder if the amount I’ve accumulated has come all at once.</p>
<p>『Now! Let’s just annihilate them all at once!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>There were still eight magic stone soldiers left. There was no way they could escape Fran and Urushi, and the battle was over in less than three minutes.</p>
<p>『Uwaah, that was a good prey!』</p>
<p>「Nn! Master looks happy」</p>
<p>『It’s been a while since I’ve been self-evolution!』</p>
<p>Moreover, my magic stone value had been less than 1000 until my next self-evolution. It wouldn’t be that far off until I self-evolution again.</p>
<p>『Well then, I wonder what’s going on with the old men?』</p>
<p>「Undead have decreased significantly」</p>
<p>『Yeah』</p>
<p>The number of undead, which had been close to 5,000, had been reduced by half. Well, there were about 300 more now in front of us. It was a tremendous annihilation power.</p>
<p>Moreover, their coordination was very clever.</p>
<p>Gamudo led the way. Using skills to provoke opponents, he was able to take on almost all undead hate in one go.</p>
<p>「Doryaaaaah!」</p>
<p>With loud shouts, he swung down a hammer bigger than himself and literally crushed the undead. Thanks to the heavy armor he wore, it was unscathed, no matter how much it gathered in the undead. This was how it fought, it looked like a dwarf.</p>
<p>Diaz seemed to be guarding two rearguards a little behind him. He was defeating the undead that Gamudo had shot, while using illusion magic to guide the undead toward Gamudo.</p>
<p>They must be trying to put the undead in one place as much as possible.</p>
<p>That’s when Eiworth’s magic exploded. He used ice and snow magic to freeze a large area. About 200 undead that had swarmed around Gamudo were covered in white Frost.</p>
<p>Or rather, it also involved Gamudo!</p>
<p>To my surprise, Gamudo didn’t seem to care about magic and continued to crush the undead in the snowstorm. Eiworth was also the target of magic along with his friends in the royal capital, but was this the cause of that unbounded behavior!?</p>
<p>If he was always fighting like this, it wouldn’t be surprising if he thought that he would get caught up in it as long as he didn’t die.</p>
<p>Next, Fermus’ threads went on a rampage. A group of threads laid out over a wide area went on a rampage at once, cutting down the undead. That would have shaved another 100 pieces.</p>
<p>Moreover, if the old men were serious, they could destroy it much faster. However, they dared to use this strategy to cut down the undead for sure.</p>
<p>She chose to fight with less exhaustion because she didn’t even know what was going to happen next.</p>
<p>In fact, that was all we needed to know.</p>
<p>『Such a huge magical reaction from the Shallus army!』</p>
<p>「There’s a pillar of light」</p>
<p>A huge pillar of light rose from the Shallus army, which had remained in the rear without even entering the undead rescue.</p>
<p>Quite strong magic power was released, and the pillar of light gradually transformed into a magic circle.</p>
<p>Wasn’t that pretty bad if we just left it alone? I guess it was just a matter of interfering by unleashing magic! I wasn’t the only one who thought that.</p>
<p>As soon as I released my magic, Eiworth and Fermus attacked as well. Eiworth activated both deadly poison magic and ice and snow magic at the same time. Fermus rained down the strings and pierced the soldiers. They were really all-powerful if we made proper use of the strings.</p>
<p>They had probably defeated quite a few soldiers, but the soldiers did not move from that spot. No, it seemed that their movements were blocked in some way, so they couldn’t move, not that they couldn’t.</p>
<p>Then the magic circle emitted a particularly strong light.</p>
<p>After the flash of light, all that remained was a group of thousands of soldiers lying on the ground and a huge one. It was a brown clump about as small as a mountain, but...</p>
<p>『Dragons, huh? What a dragon, right? It’s just so huge......』</p>
<p>It was a few steps larger than the water dragon I had seen before. It was not twice as big or anything like that, but at least ten times larger. Even in its current state, it was nearly 100 meters tall.</p>
<p>I could feel the presence of aggressive mana coming from all over me. Obviously, it was a threat level of B or higher, and in some cases, it might be an A level.</p>
<p>「Oi oi! That was a mountain dragon, wasn’t it!? It’s a high-ranking species dragon!」</p>
<p>「Hmph! I haven’t seen that in a long time. Judging from his body color, he is the type that lives on this continent.」</p>
<p>「It’s just a small mountain dragon though.」</p>
<p>「Maybe it’s because I cut down the magic power of the summons? My skin feels a little dull. I don’t think its meat quality is good too」</p>
<p>Mountain dragons, as the name suggested, are dragons that grow huge like mountains. The threat level was quite different from C-A.</p>
<p>It was said to grow up to nearly 300 meters long, so this guy was probably still small.</p>
<p>「Hey young miss! Can we take the lead?」</p>
<p>「Nn. What should I do?」</p>
<p>「I’m going to ask you to stop. Please pause until you signal me otherwise.」</p>
<p>「Okay」</p>
<p>Fran obeyed Gamudo’s words. She was their forerunner as an adventurer, a guildmaster, and a specialist in fighting dragons. There was no reason not to.</p>
<p>「That’s good to hear! It’s been a while since we’ve hunted dragonkin!」</p>
<p>「I’m gonna have you talk about a lot of undead!」</p>
<p>「It looks like you’ve been summoned, but are you still corpses? I need scales.」</p>
<p>「Your mountain dragon’s tongue is a treat, so please leave it to us」</p>
<p>The old man was staring at the mountain dragon as it started to move, precisely targeting its prey.</p>
<p>I wonder what just happened when Fran, the natural enemy of the magic stone soldiers, and Gamudos, the natural enemy of the dragons, happened to be here? Yes, I’m sure it was because of the bad behavior of the Raidos Kingdom every day.</p>
