</div><h1>Chapter 1097</h1><p>Fran, who was hired by Esmeralda, was immediately deployed to a nobleman’s mansion on the list. About 30 soldiers, Count Bailleys, and a maid were on our list. She had changed to the same equipment as the other soldiers, so they were no longer maids. She was one of the main forces in the dark. Her name was Blue, although it seemed to be a pseudonym. It seemed to be something like a code name. Fran was also wearing a mask and ready to go. Esmeralda said that she wouldn’t be able to remember her face, but to be more precise, she didn’t seem to remember anything at all. No matter how much she tried to remember later, she would only remember that she was a Beastman woman. No matter how much the other party tried to remember later, they would only remember that she was a Beastman woman.  She said that it was a high-ranking magic tool that Esmeralda had found in the dungeon. She lent her a lightly, but it was quite a valuable thing, since Esmeralda was not with her. Esmeralda was not there either.  She was waiting at the royal castle, also acting as a commander for the other execution troops.  I don’t think it was by chance that Count Bailleys had come with Fran.  She was chosen to accompany her as support because she was an acquaintance. But it was also convenient for us.  I wanted to tell her something about Velmeria and Tilanaria’s situation. It was not going well in the castle because there were other people’s eyes.  But this time, we’ll make it successful!  Well, the task is simple.  </p>
<p>「Hey, are you a knight now? Are you a soldier?」</p>
<p>「Hmm?  Oh, I see.  She was an escort knight now, but she was pretending to be a soldier this time.  It was because it doesn’t stand out. Our country’s guard knights are assigned a variety of jobs besides escorting the King, so this is how common it is」</p>
<p>「Hey」</p>
<p>  She seems to be the King’s servant, doesn’t she?  He must be in a position to do anything else.  But this is the first time I’ve done something like that before. He’s here to ask him about the current situation and then tell us about our current situation!  </p>
<p>「I was in Gordicia」</p>
<p>「Hou!  Is that so?」</p>
<p>  Obviously, Count Bailleys looked interested.  But I don’t miss out on the momentary concern for Blue.  Like I thought, he somehow knew where Velmeria was. But he didn’t know exactly where she was.  </p>
<p>「I met Tilanaria」</p>
<p>「I see.  Aah, I’m just on a mission, so don’t talk too privately」</p>
<p>  He thought Fran might be able to talk about Velmeria with the same momentum. Well, I guess Fran would normally say that out loud. Don’t worry, she’s just obeying my instructions.  </p>
<p>「Tilanaria, a lot has happened, but she’s currently living happily.」</p>
<p>「I see.」</p>
<p>「Nn. With other dragonkin or with her younger brother.」</p>
<p>「! I see!」</p>
<p> That’s good enough. Frederick was also Velmeria’s education officer under the Count’s command.  The Count knew that his love was directed at Velmeria, and that she should be with her now.  And Tilanaria, the Count’s sweetheart, was Fran’s big brother and sister, and Velmeria’s uncle.And Tilanaria, who was also the count’s sweetheart, was her big brother and sister, and Velmeria was her uncle too.  After all, since she became an evil dragonkin, she has tried to avoid talking publicly.  But there was no way the count himself didn’t know about it.  In other words, the fact that Tilanaria was with her younger brother meant that Velmeria, her companion, would be with her.  That must have been the reason why he was told so.  The problem was that Blue was clearly wondering.  Fran was looking for a fight, while the count was suspicious of her behavior. Since he’s in the dark, he’s probably looking for Velmeria’s whereabouts, so why not? </p>
<p>「Blue, what’s wrong?」</p>
<p>「No, it’s nothing.  I’ve been told to throw away the private part of Countess.  I’ll just tell you not to ask.」</p>
<p> That’s not a lie.  The King apparently told her that she doesn’t have to chase Velmeria anymore.  He’s obviously risking his bounties, but he won’t be able to put in the trouble of tracking them down. As we walked along, we arrived at our destination. </p>
<p>「I see it」</p>
<p>「Is that Viscount Ozelo’s mansion?」</p>
<p>「Yes. As long as you don’t try to intervene and force her in the first place, you can use force」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>  Blue had a somewhat complicated expression on her face.  She seemed to be opposed to making a hard run. However, it reminded me that Esmeralda had unleashed her killing intent, and she didn’t seem to be able to voice her dissent. As expected of the legendary dark chief, she could ingrain fear into her subordinates and grip their bridles at that moment. </p>
<p>「Very well then, I’ll leave this to you!」</p>
<p>「Okay!  Oi, let’s go!」</p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>  The counts and soldiers responded to Blue’s voice. Normally, they were grown-up men who didn’t listen to the orders of the woman and the little girl. However, they seemed to be well aware of the dark and obeyed Blue’s words.  From this point on, Fran and Blue would act like subordinates to the Chief Soldier disguised as Count Bailleys. They only wanted to make sure that the soldiers were the main players.  If they continued obeying orders until the very end, it could be considered white.  We also had decent search warrants. Since we were soldiers, we were trying to identify them properly or eliminate them, but when we showed up, Fran and Blue were ready to play a role.  The count is asking the guards at the entrance to Viscount Ozelo’s mansion. As one would expect, the people here are too weak to refuse us.  The only problem would be this.  After a few minutes of waiting, we saw a large number of soldiers running toward the gate from within the mansion.  They were clearly ready to fight. The most important person shouted in an pompous manner.  </p>
<p>「Where do you think you’re going here!?  It’s Viscount Ozelo’s mansion!  Just a soldier saying it’s an on-site investigation? </p>
<p>「But we have an official letter of warning」</p>
<p>「I can’t talk like you! Bring someone higher up!」</p>
<p>  The count still seemed to be pretending to be a soldier.  He probably didn’t want his guards to know that he was moving.  However, the soldier over there was completely underestimating us.  No, about half of them would be acting. He seemed to be ordered to buy some time.  A large number of people suddenly started moving in the mansion. I don’t know if there were any spies from Raydoss, but I’m sure they had something bad to be found.  </p>
<p>「Understood」</p>
<p>「All you have to do is know!  Get home!」</p>
<p>「No, I told you I didn’t want to obey.」</p>
<p>  The count then drew his sword and held it up.  </p>
<p>「I-impossible!  S-You bastards!  You don’t know what will happen if you disobey the nobles!」</p>
<p>「Are you idiots too? Are you disobeying a country and not sure what will happen to you?」</p>
<p>「Wha-...!  Why do you just soldiers have so much authority?」</p>
<p>「Just as the count declared that, Fran and Blue moved. They slammed the twenty soldiers in an instant.  They hadn’t killed them, but they wouldn’t wake up for a while. The soldiers were a little surprised by the lightning magic that Fran and I unleashed, but the damage to us was about that.  </p>
<p>「Still no further talk. Capture or kill everyone in the mansion!」</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Yeah!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>「The two are moving freely」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>「Please seal the entrance」</p>
<p>She slammed down the twenty soldiers in an instant. They didn’t kill her, but they wouldn’t wake up for a while. The soldiers were a little surprised by the lightning magic that Fran and I unleashed, but the damage to us was about that level. </p>
<p>「Still no further talk. Capture or kill everyone in the mansion!」</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Yeah!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>「The two are moving about as they please」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>「Please seal the entrance」</p>
<p> After parting ways with the soldiers, Blue and Fran began to move, each with a sound of Fran kicking through the small garden in front of the gate at once.</p>
