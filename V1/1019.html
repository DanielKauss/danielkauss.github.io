</div><h1>Chapter 1019</h1><p>At the foot of the giant antidemon, everyone else remained to attack, but they could not completely erase all three of them.</p>
<p>Even if it was just my feet, it was much larger than a small building on Earth. Moreover, it was still covered with a powerful barrier.</p>
<p>Still, they all gathered all their strength and erased two of their legs.</p>
<p>Fran and Urushi swung their magic power down the hallways, while Hilt and Colbert spit out blood and covered themselves with dragonkin. Chelsea and the other dragonkin reached their limit while the others continued to unleash their magic and martial arts attacks.</p>
<p>And they succeeded in passing the third one to half-destruction. Maybe they could push it further like this?</p>
<p>However, as soon as a small hint of hope began to light up in everyone’s hearts, despair immediately began to fill them.</p>
<p>Everyone fell into a shortage of magic power, causing their attacks to become weaker. The opening was fatal. In no time at all, the regeneration speed exceeded that of the giant antidemons, and the body of the giant antidemons was being restored.</p>
<p>It’s not just that I was in a hurry. Even with only my legs, my magic absorption power was still alive, and I ran out of magic power faster than I had expected.</p>
<p>As a result, the giant antidemons had begun to regenerate in no time. They had already regenerated about half of their torso.</p>
<p>I’m frustrated, but we couldn’t win now without Addle. On the contrary, with more than half of us incompetent, we were in danger of being annihilated.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the giant antidemons still regenerating did not seem to have enough time to attack us. We should have escaped while we were still alive.</p>
<p>It would be difficult to even stall them here anymore. There would be no way to counter them unless we survive and integrate our forces into the continent.</p>
<p>If she was planning to keep fighting on this front, she will definitely need someone of Ader’s level. However, Ader was unconscious and was wandering around the border of life and death.</p>
<p>Now we have to go to Isario or Ashwrath, but we didn’t know where they were either. No, Isario might have been buried under the castle, but it would be quite difficult to dig into and find the giant antidemons.</p>
<p>Still, there was a small chance. Either we escaped, or we headed for the castle with the possibility of Isario still alive.</p>
<p>In the latter case, they would have to be split into a search group and a decoy group that would attract huge antidemons. There was a good chance that the decoy group would be annihilated. It could be called a “dead group”.</p>
<p>And now, Orfalve, who was also their substantial commander, seemed to have made up her mind to retreat. No one dared to voice their dissent.</p>
<p>Fran and Isario probably wanted to rescue them, but they also knew that they would not be able to sacrifice the lives of many people.</p>
<p>The person who could move picked up the one who couldn’t and started to move.</p>
<p>However, the regeneration speed of the giant antidemons had exceeded our expectations. Perhaps due to the supply of magic power from the Abyss Eater, they seemed to be faster than before.</p>
<p>Before we could get enough distance, the giant antidemon started to move. We only had five legs left, but that seemed to be enough to move. It approached us with an unrealistic speed, while wildly moving its newly regenerated legs.</p>
<p>「O warriors of Snorabbit, step forward!」</p>
<p>「「「Yeah!」」」</p>
<p>「I guess we’ll have to help them too. Those who can’t move won’t get enough time to escape.」</p>
<p>「We’ll do the same, Colbert. Let the others go down with the adventurers.」</p>
<p>「Understood, young miss.」</p>
<p>Even the dwarves seemed to be astonished after they calmed down. Even in the face of the approaching giant antidemons, they seemed to be lined up neatly.</p>
<p>Fran was ready with me and ready to go. But just before the giant antidemons reached us, Fran had discovered something.</p>
<p>(Master, there’s something there.)</p>
<p>『What?』</p>
<p>When we followed Fran’s gaze, I could definitely see something flying above us. Even from here, I could tell that it was reasonably large.</p>
<p>Immediately after we noticed, the mysterious flying object began to dive down at once, approaching the back of the giant antidemon.</p>
<p>I finally got a full view of it.</p>
<p>A bright red dragon, the familiar one.</p>
<p>「Rindo!」</p>
<p>『Yeah!』</p>
<p>It was the Red Dragon Lind, the incarnation of the violent dragon sword, Lyndovrum. In other words, the one on his back was――.</p>
<p>Several shadows then jumped down from Lind.</p>
<p>「Mea! Quina is there too!」</p>
<p>『And then there is Zefmate and Sophie!』</p>
<p>Though falling, they unleashed their own attacks. Mea’s white flames and Lind’s breath, Quina and Zefmate crushed their legs in rapid succession. Each of them was hiding a surprising amount of power, perhaps enhanced by Sophie’s magical songs.</p>
<p>「Fuahaha! I, come!」</p>
<p>「If I have time to waste, I’ll be joining up with Fran-san and the others.」</p>
<p>「U-umm!」</p>
<p>Zefmate and Sophie followed Mea and Quina as usual.</p>
<p>「Fran! You’re safe!」</p>
<p>「Nn! But why are you here?」</p>
<p>「Because of that abominable wall!」</p>
<p>To our surprise, the thin purple barrier that appeared along with the giant antidemons had apparently covered a much wider area than we thought. They had even absorbed Nocta inside.</p>
<p>「I came to scout out the huge antidemon, thinking it had a cause......」</p>
<p>「Looks like we arrived at a good place, huh!?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Thank you.」</p>
<p>「We’ll hold him back! Fran, you help me too!」</p>
<p>「Okay!」</p>
<p>Thus began a huge antidemon stall led by Mea, Quina, Zefmate, Fran, Urushi, and Hilt. All of them were capable of high-speed movement.</p>
<p>Orfalve and Jayne left the scene again, accompanied by their troops. It was easier to escape with a small number of people behind.</p>
<p>Sophie’s magical songs on Lind increased the offensive power of all of them. Because of this, we were able to focus on destroying the legs of the giant antidemons while continuing to hinder their movements.</p>
<p>(Sophie, don’t you hear the adventurer’s song?)</p>
<p>『Wouldn’t that be impossible without the help of the people from the town? If she could use that single song, then the oratorium was way too powerful.』</p>
<p>(I see......)</p>
<p>In Fran’s case, she probably just wanted to hear an adventurer’s song. It’s a little disappointing though. Well, it’s also motivating, and I don’t hate it too.</p>
<p>『Anyway, let’s keep Orfalve and Jayne busy!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>While working with Mea and Zelos Reed, she continued to stall the giant antidemons. Although she had many legs, it depended on which one she was aiming for.</p>
<p>We had been intensively attacking the three on the right, always aiming for a state where it was difficult to balance. Fran, Mea, and Hilt were the main ones, and I’m sure they were going well so far.</p>
<p>But in terms of time, we were only a few minutes. Attacks from over there were always a killing blow, and I was only careful to avoid them, which made me feel like I was fighting for tens of minutes.</p>
<p>However, in a little while, she would be freed from this last battle. According to a report from Jayne’s wielder, she would be able to use her stealth grant to all troops in a few minutes.</p>
<p>As long as we can escape the troops over there, our work will be over. We can take advantage of the speed difference to escape at once. No matter how strong the giant antidemons are, we won’t lose in speed.</p>
<p>However, there was no way this mighty enemy would end like this. The battle, which seemed to be going smoothly, was accompanied by something strange.</p>
<p>The movements of the giant antidemons suddenly stopped. They stopped and began to twitch on the spot, the same as when he had transformed into seven legs.</p>
<p>The giant antidemons began to change their shape again, making a deafening sound.</p>
<p>Seven legs and heads then sank into my body. Then, as if the inside of my torso was wriggling little by little, it began to swell.</p>
<p>What used to be a rather thin form, similar to a spider, was transformed into a circular form with mainly roundness. Its torso began to swell at once.</p>
<p>A few dozen seconds later, it was a sphere. It was a very clean sphere.</p>
<p>Because of the armored joint, it looked somewhat like a soccer ball.</p>
<p>It looked thinner in the center than that giant antidemon――but it was actually a ditch about ten meters wide that circled its body.</p>
<p>I could see the spheres lined up in the ditch... Anyway, they were simple yet had a strange aura of intimidation.</p>
<p>「Buurooourgh!」</p>
<p>『Hah! I-it’s lying on the ground?』</p>
