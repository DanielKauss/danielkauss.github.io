</div><h1>Chapter 963</h1><p>「......As the giant antidemons vanished, Fran looked at them with a puzzled look. She couldn’t help but feel frustrated at the fact that she couldn’t defeat them with her own power alone. </p>
<p>(...I couldn’t defeat them)</p>
<p>『Can’t she still use the Black Lightning God’s Claws? </p>
<p>(Nn... difficult)</p>
<p> At the moment of the attack, the black lightning convergence became unstable and spread out unevenly in the area. As a result, the power of the attacks she unleashed did not concentrate on the giant antidemons alone. There was also a failure to converge the black lightning when she tried to do something similar. It seemed to be very difficult to combine it with other techniques. It seemed to be very difficult to combine it with other techniques. It was a power that could be easily controlled when using Divine Beast Form or Potential Release, but it usually required tremendous concentration.It was a power that could be easily controlled when using Divine Beast Form or Potential Release, but it usually required tremendous concentration.  I guess it would be difficult for Fran now to release such a secret art while moving at high speed and using a large number of skills.  Because she had memories of the time when she had become a Divine Beast at all, she was left in a state where she could not control the Black Lightning as she wanted. She held her fist and turned her head down for a few seconds.  But this frustration was not just her fault. </p>
<p>『To be honest, I had failed a little too much too』</p>
<p>(really?)</p>
<p>『Yeah, it was quite difficult to control my metal expressions and Divine Energy Manipulation...』</p>
<p>  The metal expression skill was a new skill for the antidemons that Announcer-san had left us.  If she had been able to use it more, she might have been able to do more damage to the giant antidemons. No, it would have definitely been inflicted.  I also feel that I didn’t know how to use the monetary formulas well. The same went for Divine Energy Manipulation.  I’ll have to practice using those two skills more in the future. The other skill was Evil Spirit Control. If I could convert the Evil God Fragments inside myself as well as the Evil Spirits I absorbed from the huge antidemons into magic and Divine Power, I would be able to convert it into two stones.  I’ve used it against goblins and other substances in my travels, but I’ve never used it against a superior opponent. I’m going to use them more on this continent. However, thanks to the failure of my skills, I was sure that the burden on my blade would have been reduced.  If Fran’s Black Lightning God’s Claw and my skills were in perfect control, my blade would have been in much worse shape. It was because we failed that we could only reduce my durability value by half.  </p>
<p>(It needs more training)</p>
<p>『Well, that’s right.  But don’t push yourself too hard. When she failed to activate the Black Lightning God’s Claw before.  It was triggered even if the damage was reduced by half this time.  It was steady growth. Even so, a figure approached Fran with a unhappy expression on her face.』</p>
<p>「Oi, young miss!」</p>
<p>「Isarioi, what’s wrong with you? Did you happen to have made a mistake?」</p>
<p>「... Nn」</p>
<p>  I saw Fran’s smug atmosphere and understood that she was not convinced of the result.  Isario patted Fran on the shoulder.  </p>
<p>「She always tried to challenge and failed when she was young.  Besides, thanks to you, I was able to have a lot of fun too. </p>
<p>「Young miss, that was amazing!」</p>
<p>「As expected of the Black Lightning Princess!」</p>
<p>「Uooh!  You saved my life!」</p>
<p>  The adventurers who found their lives shouted in silence. They know that Isario was not the only one who saved their lives.  Fran smiled happily when she saw the men running toward her.  </p>
<p>『We’ve been able to save Brutori.Fran smiled happily when she saw the men running toward her.  </p>
<p>『We’ve been able to protect Bryne, so let’s be happy with that now』</p>
<p>(Nn.  We returned to the town with Fran, who had calmed down, and were still greeted by the adventurers.  Everyone was watching closely what Fran had healed.  They thanked her, and those close to her clapped their shoulders and heads violently. Fran accepted them with a slightly annoying but fun look on her face.  They were all happy about the victory for a little while, but soon Isario began giving them instructions. The adventurers went to look around the town.  As a result, some of the people who lost their lives in the giant antidemon’s magic absorption were old men and sick, who were originally weakened, and many others were safe. A day’s sleep would improve the exhaustion of their magic power and the sickness.  It was one of the few damage suffered by such a town. It was the result of adventurers risking their lives.  A few hours after the huge antidemon was defeated.  The sun set, and the curtain of nighttime magic enveloped the earth in Gordicia. However, Isario burned the corpses of the people who had died.  Earth was scarce on this continent, so cremation was apparently the norm. It was apparently common for people to cremation.  In addition, there were no individual graves, but many of them were put in large graves where they could be gathered.  In a warm flame with purification power, their bodies melted as if they were vaporized, and they turned into bones. Then the bones gradually changed their shape and eventually crumbled down like sand. Collecting the bones that had turned into complete ashes, the bereaved family and friends carried them to the grave.  </p>
<p>「Well, let’s see what will happen next.  I don’t know what will happen to the other towns. Nocta and Sendia, I’m worried.  Well, I don’t think it would be a good idea to go back to Nocta first to get some information.  Will my little lady wolf be able to run?」</p>
<p>  Don’t worry. </p>
<p>「Oh, that’s it.  If that’s the case, I’ll leave Brutori in the middle of the night and head for Nocta.」</p>
<p>「Nn!  If there were any huge antidemons in various places, there might have been a lot of damage in the first place.</p>
<p>「Well, let’s see what will happen after this. I don’t know what will happen to the other towns after all. Nocta and Sendia, I’m worried. Well, I think it’s best to go back to Nocta first to get some information. Can my little lady wolf run?」</p>
<p>「Don’t worry, Urushi won’t get tired, he’ll still be able to fly with his sword」</p>
<p>「Oh, that’s it. If that’s the case, I’ll leave Brutori in the middle of the night and head for Nocta.」</p>
<p>「Nn! If there were any huge antidemons in various places, there might have been a lot of damage in the first place. Whatever the matter how we move, we needed information.</p>
