</div><h1>Chapter 949</h1><p>「Anything else, the name of the Divine Sword?」</p>
<p>「Original Sword Alpha, Mad God’s Sword Berserk, Knight of Battle, Charlotte, Golden Dragon’s Sword, El Dorado, Earth’s Sword, Gaia, Brilliant Flame Sword, Ignis, Water Spirit’s Sword, Crystalos, Holy Area Sword, Sanctuary, Roaring Sword, Tempest, Wisdom Sword. It’s only possible to guess by observation, but we can teach you a certain level of ability」</p>
<p>「I want to know!」</p>
<p>Me too!</p>
<p>But we were not in a position to have a long conversation right now.</p>
<p>『Fran. Let’s go back to town first. I’d like to hear what you have to say peacefully』</p>
<p>「Nn. You can enter the town?」</p>
<p>「No problem」</p>
<p>This continent didn’t have any strict screenings to get in. It was a continent full of former criminals, so there’s no point in worrying about their identities. As long as they didn’t give off the aura of antidemons, we could get in.</p>
<p>The antidemons seemed to be annihilated too, and Isario also seemed strangely irritated. I’m not sure if he was tired or not because of the old man who was still full of antidemons.</p>
<p>It may have been showing off her strength, but the Divine Sword Release was so short, so I’m sure it was better than Ader.</p>
<p>Having been on this continent for a long time, he seemed to know how to keep his wear and tear.</p>
<p>(Isario here.)</p>
<p>Even at this distance, he seemed to have naturally caught Fran. He was waving at her with a flustered expression.</p>
<p>He didn’t seem to care about getting us involved in this. Well, it was probably because we were bad, and he didn’t think we were gonna die from it.</p>
<p>I decided not to go alone, since I wouldn’t be a problem. I guess it was important for Isario to be able to do everything from start to finish.</p>
<p>We headed back to Brutori a little ahead of us and headed straight for the inn. I thought we were going to talk at the bar, but it was going to be a long one. I’d rather stay in a place where there were no strange obstacles.</p>
<p>Fran offered the Silver Lady a chair and sat herself down on the bed.</p>
<p>「Tell me about the Divine Sword」</p>
<p>「Understood」</p>
<p>Fran couldn’t wait and asked a few questions. It would be quite rare to see such an excited expression on someone’s face except before a battle or a meal.</p>
<p>I could understand how he felt. After all, I could hear directly from the Divine level blacksmiths about the Divine Sword.</p>
<p>「Then, should we start by getting information about the Blade of Origin, Alpha?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Please」</p>
<p>Alpha could even become an enemy in some cases. So, I wanted to know as much about it as possible.</p>
<p>「The divine sword, Alpha, is currently managed by the Holy Nation of Silard. Its owner is called the Divine Sword Knight, and it is repeatedly replaced in about 5 to 10 years」</p>
<p>「Is it that short?」</p>
<p>Five or ten years...... An ordinary wielder of a divine sword shouldn’t lose that much.</p>
<p>There is no way that the Divine Sword Knight will be defeated every ten years, although that may not be the case in our long history.</p>
<p>If such a dangerous being were to appear, it would be a crisis for the country or the world.</p>
<p>「Each of the Divine Swords requires a high price to use. This is probably the reason why there is a large replacement of Alpha’s wielder.」</p>
<p>「A Divine Sword comes with all the costs?」</p>
<p>「Yes. Every Divine Sword comes with its price and restrictions」</p>
<p>The Silver Lady’s explanation was very understandable. The Divine Sword was a super weapon that quickly changed the terrain and enabled the slaughter of large numbers of antidemons. If used repeatedly for personal interests and self-interest, it would be more dangerous than an Evil God.</p>
<p>That’s why there are various restrictions. The first restriction is the upper limit of the number of existence. There is a maximum of 26 of them set by the Gods. And more than that, even a Divine level blacksmith cannot create one.</p>
<p>The second restriction was the choice of wielder. Not only could anyone handle it, but only those who met the requirements could be equipped. In many cases, the Divine Sword itself chose the wielder.</p>
<p>「What’s the limitation of Alpha?」</p>
<p>「In order to use the Blade of Origin, Alpha, you must be recognized as an wielder by a pair of special magic tools. They are currently controlled by the Silard Royal Family」</p>
<p>If the Royal Family of Silard could choose an wielder, they’d work for the sake of the country. But Adors don’t seem like royalty, do they bother to choose a commoner?</p>
<p>「The conditions for becoming an Alpha’s wielder are that you don’t have a kinship with the selector and that you have a high level of knowledge about some of the skills」</p>
<p>「What do you mean by “that thing”?」</p>
<p>「Yes. There should be no blood connection. However, the noble families of Silard are said to have complicated blood relations, and most of them are kin.」</p>
<p>That must be the reason why they chose the common people after being brainwashed. Considering the high level of consciousness among the holy knights, it was not surprising that Silard’s nobles gave their power to the common people.</p>
<p>The third restriction was the price the user had to pay. In some cases, it even caused a heavy price that could even kill them.</p>
<p>「The price for Alpha is the lack of experience and a decrease in level」</p>
<p>「...Does it lower my level when I use it?」</p>
<p>「Yes. We have discovered that the level of the knights has decreased little by little since they were released, so I can’t gain any experience during that time. The duration of their activities must have been at their original level. Some knights even used their divine swords for half a day when the pieces of the Evil Gods were resurrected in the northern continent. I estimate that it will decrease by about one level in ten minutes」</p>
<p>Six levels in an hour, or seventy- two levels in a twelve-hour period. That’s calculated to be half a day. You could also be active for a long time if your original level was higher, huh?</p>
<p>Moreover, the price of lowering his level was a trap. After using it, the backlash of using the Divine Sword attacked us at once when the level had dropped too low.</p>
<p>The backlash was not a price to pay. It was the damage to the body and exhaustion from the forced use of power beyond human beings.</p>
<p>The backlash from the use of the Divine Sword was so intense that even the average person could not endure it. As a result, the Divine Sword Knight, who had fallen too low as a price, could not withstand the backlash and lost his life.</p>
<p>Judging from how worn he was, I could understand that he was dangerous if he was a little weaker. Considering his safety margin, he would probably die as a backlash if he wasn’t at the 25~30 level.</p>
<p>「What is known from Alpha’s stats is a significant increase in physical stats. However, as the level continues to drop, its efficacy will also decrease」</p>
<p>「I see」</p>
<p>The more you use it, the less status you’ll get.</p>
<p>「Moreover, the skill is further enhanced. However, no evolution will occur due to this power. However, the skills given to the wielder upon release are Sword King Skill, Sword King Technique, Physical Manipulation, Divine Power Control, Instant Regeneration, Abnormal Condition Nullification, and Air Movement are certain」</p>
<p>「Sword King Technique!」</p>
<p>So that’s why I’ve become so skilled in swords. Even if my swordsmanship was at the highest level, it was strange that I became that skilled.</p>
<p>It increased my physical stats ten times, I was given Sword King Mastery, and the other skills were maxed out. They were just as strong as normal, but the cost was probably too high.</p>
<p>『It seems that his level is still low, huh...?』</p>
<p>The Divine Sword that weakened as it continued to fight and defeat its enemies. It was very terrifying to replace it with its own.</p>
<p>Fran thought back to the time when she used it too. She then frowned slightly.</p>
<p>(Master is the best, so I can’t compare it to Alpha)</p>
<p>『When you say that, I’m sure they’re doing their best』</p>
<p>(Nn. As long as I have Master)</p>
<p>『Hahaha. You get embarrassed.』</p>
