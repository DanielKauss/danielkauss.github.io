</div><h1>Chapter 982</h1><p>「Ruoooh!」</p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>The battle between Fran and the Elder Rezalva seemed to be evenly matched at first glance.</p>
<p>Although Fran had the advantage in sword techniques and speed, Resalva attacked us ferociously, not caring about taking any hits. Moreover, the sword coming out of her strong arm was tremendously powerful.</p>
<p>『It’s pretty tough!』</p>
<p>(Nn. Scales, like armor)</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because the Sacrament of the Dragon God had strengthened the dragonkin’s scales, which were very hard. They couldn’t even get a scratch with a light check.</p>
<p>Even if she cuts open a slash with a strong attack, her regeneration skills will soon return to normal.</p>
<p>That was a lot of trouble. But another annoying thing was its resilience.</p>
<p>They instantly covered not only the scales, but also the wounds that had pierced through them. We were using Life Magic, which slowed down the healing of our wounds, but it didn’t seem to work.</p>
<p>She didn’t seem to mind the black lightning that pierced her body many times before, and paralyzing didn’t work on her.</p>
<p>In fact, he even dared to take our attacks and attack them at an unexpected time. The way he missed the timing showed his experience in combat.</p>
<p>However, Resalva was not suited for her old age and was very irritated. Being equal with a girl like Fran seemed to have hurt her pride. The negative effects of her mental manipulation may have made it impossible for her to control her emotions.</p>
<p>Besides, Fran knew exactly what I was saying. Her current state seemed to be even, but not equal. Fran was not yet serious, and Rezalua’s magic power was gradually diminishing.</p>
<p>That’s how much Rezalva was trying to push herself too hard, continuing to use regeneration and physical enhancement.</p>
<p>Even though the old man was trying to push himself too hard, Fran was thinking about what to do next and was fighting in a way that kept her back on track. This must have reversed Rezalva’s feelings.</p>
<p>She attacked even more violently, but Fran took care of it with all her might. While she was doing so, my magic was unleashed, accumulating more damage for Rezalua.</p>
<p>Maybe it was because she had seen Isario fight before? Fran’s parrying technique was even sharper than before, and she was now able to perfectly defend against Rezalva’s greatsword.</p>
<p>Even if the attacks were to cause damage to his friends if they were to be damaged, he would do so in a way that would reduce the power of the attacks and let the impact escape into the sky.</p>
<p>As we fought, I could see that Fran had grown a lot.</p>
<p>But our opponent was an experienced old warrior. Even though his thoughts were slowing down due to mental manipulation, he soon realized that Fran was fighting to not cause any damage to her comrades.</p>
<p>「How can I prevent this!?」</p>
<p>「Muh!」</p>
<p>「Gwoogh!」</p>
<p>Rezalva radiated a large amount of flames from her mouth. It was not very powerful, but a direct hit from the soldiers and adventurers would not be enough.</p>
<p>Moreover, it had a wide range.</p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>Fran quickly unleashes magic and slashes to extinguish the flames. But this was exactly what Rezalva was aiming for.</p>
<p>She created time to pause Fran’s movement and hoard more techniques. She bent her back slightly, breathing heavily enough for her chest to swell nearly twice.</p>
<p>「Wrrrooof!」</p>
<p>What was emitted from there was a red flash of light. An exhalation of flames that burned the air and pushed in a straight line toward Fran, who had finished intercepting the flames.</p>
<p>I can dodge them, but if Fran doesn’t catch them, the rest of our army will be left in tatters.</p>
<p>「Haaaaah!」</p>
<p>「Wrrrooof!」</p>
<p>Fran’s barrier and Rezalua’s flames collided, and the red light then dyed the surrounding area.</p>
<p>『Fran, hold on for two more seconds!』</p>
<p>「Daaaaah!」</p>
<p>Fran activated her magic release to scatter the red flash of light. This was probably the result of watching Isario’s battles. Not only was she able to parry with her sword, but her entire defensive action had grown.</p>
<p>But it was not enough for Isario yet. It was just right after Fran’s hand, which was thrust forward, started to smoke from the heat.</p>
<p>『Don’t waste Fran’s hard work!』</p>
<p>I activated my Dimensional Magic, the same technique I used to block the giant stone throw. At the Dimension Gate, I shot back his flames.</p>
<p>But we couldn’t just release it randomly in this disorderly brawl. That’s why I opened the gate right above him.</p>
<p>「Gah! What the hell!」</p>
<p>It had high resistance to flame, so the damage was not that bad. However, she was probably flustered by the sudden attack from where there was no sign of the enemy at all. She then stopped attacking and looked up at the sky unintentionally.</p>
<p>That was a big opening.</p>
<p>But Fran didn’t miss that moment and went all in.</p>
<p>Even without Fran saying anything, I could feel what she wanted to do. I squeezed out my Divine Power and Magic Power and clothed it on my blade.</p>
<p>By using magic and skills to accelerate, Fran was able to leave only the afterimage of black lightning behind and thinning out the dragonkin’s old warriors at a speed that even made it move instantaneously.</p>
<p>Resalva immediately noticed, but by that time, Fran had already swung me down from above.</p>
<p>「Impossible......!」</p>
<p>「...Fuh」</p>
<p>Rezalva fell to the ground after being cut in half from his shoulders to his crotch. It was settled too quietly.</p>
<p>「Gah...... Gugh...... Why am I here......?」</p>
<p>It was impressive that she did not die instantly, but Divine Energy Attacks were harder to regenerate. As expected, she probably didn’t have as much regenerative power as the higher tier antidemons. She was soon immobilized.</p>
<p>『We were able to defeat a strong opponent with the bare minimum of mana.』</p>
<p>(I would have been in a pinch if the other party had been more intelligent)</p>
<p>『Yeah. I’m sure we had to use her trump card』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p>Even in a place like this, Fran looks a little disappointed. I guess she has some feeling that she wanted to fight against a serious Resalva.</p>
<p>『Anyways, let’s back everyone up for now』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
