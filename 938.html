</div><h1>Chapter 938</h1><p>Fran, who had been refused the mock battle by Isario, was out in town to heal her wounds. She wanted to get some snacks at the cafe where she met Sophie.</p>
<p>On the way there, I suddenly heard the buzzing of people. Apparently, something was going on in the north gate.</p>
<p>I thought it might be an antidemon attack, but it didn’t look that way. It was more of a cheer than a scream.</p>
<p>I was curious, so we headed for the gate, and I understood why they were cheering. Apparently, a famous army had arrived.</p>
<p>The people running beside Fran were talking about how they were looking forward to what kind of person this time.</p>
<p>Nocta was a popular destination for many people, and was probably visited by famous adventurers’ parties, knights, and mercenaries. For the people of town, onlookers like them became a kind of entertainment.</p>
<p>After walking for a while, I saw a group of people walking toward us along the main street. They were surrounded by onlookers, so I’m sure they were the center of the ruckus.</p>
<p>As we paused to watch, we could clearly see the group of people walking past them.</p>
<p>All of the leaders wore matching armor, indicating that they were a knight from somewhere. Including the knights and their attendants, they were probably a group of about 300.</p>
<p>I mean, the knight’s white silver armor looks familiar to me.</p>
<p>(The holy knight?)</p>
<p>『Yeah. These guys are the knights of Silard.』</p>
<p>I had just seen the emblem of a sword and a horse on a white silver armor shining in the sunlight the other day. There was no mistake. These were the holy knights of Silard.</p>
<p>Could it be that there is another Divine Sword Knight in here? Because of the guard of honor walking while raising the flag of the country, we couldn’t see the center of the group. We couldn’t even feel any presence of them either.</p>
<p>But isn’t this really bad? What if the holy knights fleeing Sendia gave them a convenient report to their main forces?</p>
<p>Fran might have been considered enemy by the holy knights. If everyone was just like that, they would not be able to listen to us.</p>
<p>『Fran, let’s leave this place for now』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p>Fran was about to leave because she was mistaken for an onlooker. There was a commotion from the gate again. It seems that there was another famous group coming here.</p>
<p>While leaving the holy knights, we headed toward the gate. There, we saw a group of strange-looking men clad in the same equipment.</p>
<p>There were over a thousand in total. But it was not a knight order, but a group of soldiers. Moreover, all of them were old men.</p>
<p>A group of old spearmen, dressed in plain jet-black light equipment, appeared through the gate as a group.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a carriage was seen in the center. It was a very imposing white carriage, unlike the equipment of the plain old men. It was pulled by eight horses.</p>
<p>It was the Rank C monster, Slapneil. That alone was enough to stand out, but a strange amount of magic power leaked out from inside.</p>
<p>I guess even powerful magicians were riding on it. Maybe their commander was in that carriage? The flag was a black sword on a red background and a white large ring of flowers that crossed with it. It was an flag that I couldn’t forget at first glance, which reminded me of the calamity and nobility of it.</p>
<p>「That flag, it’s the flag of General Hagane.」</p>
<p>「What do you mean by “hagane” in the north? You mean Silard and his dog-ape friends, right?」</p>
<p>「Don’t skirmish in Nocta, okay?」</p>
<p>Along with Fran, I listened to the people’s conversations. I heard that this group of soldiers belonged to the Militant Nation of Hagane. They were supposed to be a military power that split the northern continent from Silard.</p>
<p>To us, it had a strong impression of the country that possessed the divine sword Berserk.</p>
<p>So, both military powers have come to Nocta.</p>
<p>(Divine sword, somewhere?)</p>
<p>『Hmmm, in the carriage, huh? I don’t know if it’s in a place where we can’t see it』</p>
<p>(Unfortunately.)</p>
<p>Fran must have wanted to see Berserk at first sight.</p>
<p>『Let’s head to the Adventurers Guild later. We might be able to get some useful information from them』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p>I went to a cafe, which was my original goal. But on the way, I met a familiar face again.</p>
<p>「Ara? You’re not Fran!」</p>
<p>「Oh, they’re back!」</p>
<p>「Jayne, Orfalve.」</p>
<p>In front of us was the queen duo who had taken care of us at Castel. Jayne Dovey, the queen of demonkin, and Orfalve Falnis, the queen of dwarves.</p>
<p>As I’d expected, they seemed to get along pretty well. They were accompanied by five guards each.</p>
<p>「Long time no see!」</p>
<p>「You’re certainly looking strong, huh?」</p>
<p>「Nn. Thanks for still staying」</p>
<p>「I’ve made a promise, so it’s no wonder!」</p>
<p>「We’ll stay out with you until the antidemon season is over, or until you wake up.」</p>
<p>They remained in this city, also acting as Nadia’s escort. They seemed to be staying here obediently.</p>
<p>「Still, you’ve gotten even stronger, haven’t you? I didn’t release a different aura this time!」</p>
<p>「Indeed. The battle in Sendia was certainly impressive. Could you tell me the details if you’re okay with it?」</p>
<p>「Okay」</p>
<p>「I did it! Well then, there are recommended stores to go to. Let’s get there」</p>
<p>「Well, they have private rooms too」</p>
<p>What they took us into was a hideout-like restaurant in the back alley. However, it was quite spacious inside, so the queen’s guards could eat there.</p>
<p>There were even private rooms in the back. It seemed that this was actually a high-class restaurant. The prices of the dishes were quite high, but they were not the faces of those who were bothering them.</p>
<p>She sat down at the table with a decent meal and the most expensive liquor.</p>
<p>「Then, you have to see my friend again!」</p>
<p>「Yeah!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Then, in a friendly atmosphere, they started a briefing and a meal to discuss what had happened while they were apart.</p>
<p>Fran’s report was filled with surprise. However, we were surprised as well.</p>
<p>Jayne knew about the Divine Beast Form. Well, it was really only for a little while now.</p>
<p>「A long time ago, the Demon Lord supposedly made undead beastmen with Divine Beast Form skills his kindred. He was his king’s friend and even told them to make effective use of their bodies after their death.」</p>
<p>「Do you know how to learn to become a Divine Beast?」</p>
<p>「Hmmm, I haven’t heard any details. However, according to my legends, it must have been recognized by the Gods and said that it was the White Wolf」</p>
<p>「It was approved by the Gods...」</p>
<p>So, in other words, I should have made a achievement that was recognized by the Gods. At the very least, I didn’t think it was just a matter of raising my status.</p>
