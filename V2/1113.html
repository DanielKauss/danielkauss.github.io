</div><h1>Chapter 1113</h1><p>「Sword God Transformation!」</p>
<p>『Divine Energy Manipulation, Full Effect of Spirits! And Evil Spirits! This is the critical moment! Fragment of the Evil God! Please!』</p>
<p> I fused the Divine Attribute I created with the Evil Attribute’s magic power, which flowed in greater quantities than ever from the pieces of the Evil God, and made them one. Fran’s black lightning added to that, and my sword blade shone a blinding light. </p>
<p>「Let’s go」</p>
<p>『Ou! Let’s do that!』</p>
<p> Normally, I’d jump up in the air and apply the momentum of the fall to my attack. But this time, I have to think about the damage to the town. But this time, I have to think about the damage to the town.  Fran didn’t jump in the air but ran as if she were crawling on the ground.  The Great Spirit must have sensed how bad we were now.  A huge amount of attacks were released, some even harshly and others cutely. No matter how small the space was, Fran caught the attack that was going to take up the space itself and ran across the earth while priing it open.  Five layers of barriers were instantly scraped off and she had only one left. But that brief moment was enough for Fran. She was able to reach the feet of the Great Spirit in no time at the same speed as instant movement.  No doubt there was a nucleus of the Great Spirit at Fran’s gaze. The faint movement of Marl’s magic power within Fran must have been a little something to support her. Fran folded the arms she held in her arms and pulled them back. The enormous amount of magic power that rushed through Fran’s body growled and reacted to my magic power and shone a flash of light.  Then, Fran pushes me out as if to make the most of the power of the stepped earth. I could see that all the power is concentrated on my blade, and it is under a tremendous burden.  </p>
<p>「Ruaaaaaaaaaaahh!」</p>
<p>『Uoooaaaaah!』</p>
<p> A thrust that twisted toward the sun floating in the sky pierced the Great Spirit.  Perhaps it was the effect of the Sword God Transformation, but the power of the thrust was even greater than expected. I guess I could even say it was a thrust version of the Heaven Judgement.  It felt as if it was piercing through space no matter what opponent I was with. With the feeling of clashing with something hard, the wind that was constituting the Great Spirit was blown away.  The outline of its body wavered, as if the power of the Great Spirit had been greatly reduced. I had been absorbing magic power to further reduce its power, but...  I saw something flying into the distance at a tremendous speed. There was actually a physical body in the nucleus, and I wondered if it had come flying away, but it was in a much longer, slender, rod-like, man-like shape. What surprised me was not that such a thing was inside the great spirit, but that it was tough enough to stay in shape even after taking our best thrust.  The moment I became aware of the mysterious object, my spine felt chilly.  I flew so far that I couldn’t see it anymore, but should I go to retrieve it? But before I could make a move, Fran held her ear.  </p>
<p>「Muh...!」</p>
<p>『Is it the voice of the Great Spirit?』</p>
<p>「Nn.  It was screaming...」</p>
<p>  The attack itself was a great success. I could tell that Fran’s thrust had definitely carved out and weakened the power of the Great Spirit. Not only was it thanks to Divine and Evil Spirits, but the Sword God must have accurately shot through the weak spot of the Great Spirit.  Moreover, even though the thrust was filled with tremendous power, there was no impact on the surrounding area.  All of its energy was concentrated on the thrust. However, there was strong magic power gushing out of the thrust’s line of fire. If it had been released towards the town, dozens of houses would have disappeared, wouldn’t it?  </p>
<p>「Fuuh」</p>
<p>『Durability value has been taken out of my sight...』</p>
<p>  Both Fran and I were exhausted by a single blow. We wouldn’t have been able to get the same attack again today if asked to.  </p>
<p>(Somehow, it’s weird, Marl.)</p>
<p>『What?  Could it be that you’ve used too much power?』</p>
<p>(Hmm?  On the contrary?)</p>
<p>『Does that mean you’re getting stronger?』</p>
<p>(Something like that)</p>
<p>  Does it have anything to do with the Great Spirit?  Or did it suck something out of it?  However, I couldn’t afford to spend much time observing the condition of the Great Spirit.  The Great Spirit then began to attack again. It was weaker than before, but it was still intense.  </p>
<p>『Let’s get out of here!』</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p> We started to move to distance ourselves from the Great Spirit, praying that Klimut would do better.  It seemed that we were still hearing the screams of the spirits, and Fran had a bitter look on her face.  It seemed that there was no point in holding her ears. She had been irritated for a long time.  However, her expression suddenly eased.  </p>
<p>「The spirit’s voice has stopped」</p>
<p>『Ooh!  The spirit is starting to disappear!』</p>
<p>  Immediately after Fran’s mutter, something strange happened to the Great Spirit. The Great Spirit, which had been in the form of a huge woman, began to lose its outline as if it were dissolving into the void.  When I looked at Klimut, he thrust out his arms and released magic power. However, the wind began to swirl around Klimut.  It was only a slight breeze at first, but it quickly turned into a whirlwind and was now turning into a tornado.  Fran and the others hurriedly moved away. After that, the wind continued to gain even more momentum.  I-is Klimut going to be okay?  It’s not like he’s being attacked, is it? His life force has diminished a little...  I was a little worried, but it seemed that he was okay. The tornado gradually lost its power and disappeared as if it were sucked into Klimut’s mind.  At the same time, the magic power released by the Great Spirit disappeared from the spot. Even though I shouldn’t have been able to feel any sign of the spirit, the air in the town softened, or rather, a strange sense of intimidation disappeared.  </p>
<p>『Are you okay...?』</p>
<p>「Klimut!」</p>
<p>Immediately after, Klimut collapsed on the spot.</p>
