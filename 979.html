</div><h1>Chapter 979</h1><p>Frederick pleaded with Fran to save Velmeria, who had been taken away by the Dragon King’s minions.</p>
<p>After hearing his sorrowful words, Fran could not shake her head.</p>
<p>But she couldn’t nod her head right away.</p>
<p>Now we were still working as members of the second unit. We couldn’t leave the unit without permission.</p>
<p>Fran looked back at Isario and tried to open her mouth.</p>
<p>「Isario, me――」</p>
<p>「Are you sure? However, there are conditions.」</p>
<p>「Conditions?」</p>
<p>No matter how light-hearted Isario was, he was not in such a good mood that he nodded here. In fact, we had to be grateful that he allowed us to leave even under certain conditions.</p>
<p>But what came out of Isario’s mouth were unexpected words.</p>
<p>「We’ll accompany you too. Then I’ll give you permission」</p>
<p>「Nn? Isario and Zelos Reed are with us? Why?」</p>
<p>「The Dragon King, Trismegistus, and the Dragon priestess. I can’t ignore those ears.」</p>
<p>「That’s right. Considering the relationship between the giant-type and the magic circle, we cannot help but doubt the Dragon King’s participation. We need to check on him」</p>
<p>Not only Isario but also you seemed to be on board.</p>
<p>「Are you sure?」</p>
<p>「Maybe we can manipulate the antidemons, or maybe even manipulate the Abyss Eaters? That’s not something we can leave unchecked.」</p>
<p>「It may be a world crisis, but that’s an exaggeration.」</p>
<p>The source of the antidemons, the magic beast with a threat level of S, the “Abyss Eater”. If the Gods hadn’t sealed it up with a barrier, the world might have been swallowed up.</p>
<p>If we could manipulate antidemons, would it indeed be possible to manipulate the Abyss Eater? Well, it might be possible to interfere, even if we have to control it a little too much.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, it was a big deal.</p>
<p>「Okay, Frederick, are you okay with that?」</p>
<p>「Of course. In fact, I appreciate it」</p>
<p>「Then, can I ask for a guide?」</p>
<p>「Leave it to me. Follow me.」</p>
<p>Frederick then let his wings fly. Magic power was released, and his body lifted.</p>
<p>「Frederick, did it grow?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. I’ve done it a little reckless though」</p>
<p>Could it be that dragonkin had acquired a technique to get their body closer to the dragon?</p>
<p>I wondered why the other dragonkin would not do that, but it seemed to be quite dangerous. Frederick also seemed to have prepared to lose his life by transforming his own body.</p>
<p>Frederick seemed to be in a great hurry, so we would have to leave him alone if we were not careful.</p>
<p>But none of the adventurers or soldiers complained. This was probably because they pride themselves as elites and have a sense of duty to stop the Dragon King.</p>
<p>While we were taking a short break along the way, we asked Frederick something that piqued our attention.</p>
<p>「Hey. How did you know where I was?」</p>
<p>「It’s an Innate Skill I have. It’s a power that comes from a combination of divine and intuitive skills」</p>
<p>「Whoa, amazing.」</p>
<p>『Looks convenient!』</p>
<p>I guess it’s just like looking for something to lose. However, it didn’t seem to be that convenient.</p>
<p>When it comes to items that the other party was consciously trying to hide, or when someone unintentionally tried to hide them, the search accuracy would be severely reduced.</p>
<p>That’s why they can’t find the Dragon King or the evil crystals well, and they also don’t know where Tilanaria is.</p>
<p>In Fran’s case, she was not hiding anything, so she was able to find out where she was.</p>
<p>Frederick didn’t have that kind of power when we first met him at the royal capital. That must be the result of the increase in the power of evil dragonkin.</p>
<p>「If we make full use of this power, we will know where Velmeria and Tilanaria-sama are......」</p>
<p>Even if the wielder has no intention of hiding them, it seems that the unique skill can’t be activated due to the will of someone who wanted to hide them. Indeed, it seems to be surprisingly difficult to use.</p>
<p>It’s been a day since our encounter with Frederick.</p>
<p>The second unit set foot in the central part of the continent, completely stripped of grass and completely devoured by antidemons.</p>
<p>「There’s something there.」</p>
<p>「I can’t sense any signs of the dragonkin. Ah man, maybe they’re clearly hostile.」</p>
<p>Before us was a group of dragonkin. They must have sensed our presence and positioned themselves in their tracks.</p>
<p>This was obviously hostile, but we couldn’t just attack them out of the blue. Isario stepped forward while letting our troops prepare for battle.</p>
<p>「We have some business ahead of us! It would be a hindrance if we stayed there, right?」</p>
<p>「......It’s forbidden to enter this area by anyone.」</p>
<p>「Who decided?」</p>
<p>「It is our king.」</p>
<p>「Did you guys have a king over there? You mean Trismegistus?」</p>
<p>「Wrong! Our king is Georg-sama alone! A fool like him is our king? Don’t be ridiculous! I will not allow you any longer, for you foolish inferior beings that devour our Holy Land!」</p>
<p>The dragonkin shouted, and all of them readied their weapons at once. They seemed to have no choice but to fight.</p>
<p>Isario sighed and pointed his sword at the dragonkin.</p>
<p>「It can’t be helped. Let’s take care of them. Oh, don’t worry. I won’t ask for help from anyone behind when there’s someone like that」</p>
<p>Isario provoked the dragonkin. To him, it must be easier for him to fight the dragonkin alone than to fight them in a disorderly brawl.</p>
<p>However, Fran called out to them worriedly. She was better than immediately after the giant war, but they still seemed to be exhausted.</p>
<p>「Isario, are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Hahaha! Even if you’re not at full power, these guys should be fine」</p>
<p>Perhaps due to the effect of their provocation skills, the dragonkin’s anger quickly peaked at the top.</p>
<p>「Th-that’s you! You fool us with your inferiority habit!」</p>
<p>Still, I felt like the boil point was too low. No matter how I look at it, I don’t think I was in a proper mental state.</p>
<p>Was she being mentally manipulated? Besides, I’m also curious that the dragonkin living on this continent didn’t know much about Isario.</p>
<p>『Yeah, and that toughness... I don’t think it was just because of her high status』</p>
<p>「You get angry? But you really don’t like bullying the weak. I’ll fight on my own. So don’t worry about it.」</p>
<p>「I-I’ll kill you! I’ll kill you with all my might! Red-haired apes!」</p>
<p>「Hahaha! It has many names, but I’ve never heard of a red-haired ape before」</p>
<p>「You lazy fucking play dumb!」</p>
<p>I haven’t been able to say a word to him in the middle of the fight. As I thought, it seemed that something was wrong.</p>
