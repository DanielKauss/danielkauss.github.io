</div><h1>Chapter 987</h1><p>『Hiii......』</p>
<p>「I’m glad we escaped」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「W-woof...」</p>
<p>The antidemon dragonkin were trying to stiffen with their backs facing each other at a distance, but just as I was thinking that, a slash knocked Berserk down at them.</p>
<p>Then, a large amount of jet-black magic power overflowed enveloping the Divine Sword, covering the earth with a force similar to a tsunami. It then rushed over to a wide area in an attempt to swallow the antidemon dragonkin.</p>
<p>We thought it would be bad if we didn’t escape, but the black tsunami had stopped moving at about 400 meters.</p>
<p>But if we had remained on the battlefield, we would have been caught up in it. If there was still reason behind this, I may have been able to hold back, but I don’t even know how the release of Berserk would affect our mind. Although the troops of the Militant Nation of Hagane avoided it, it was unknown if they would even take out the adventurers.</p>
<p>「I can’t sense any signs of antidemon dragonkin.」</p>
<p>「Yeah, I can’t feel it either. If it gets swallowed, it’ll be a life-threatening attack, right...? It’s terrifying...」</p>
<p>After the black tsunami with no sound pulled back, there was nothing alive there.</p>
<p>The antidemon dragonkin were not the only ones who lost their lives. The sparse grass and trees, and the faint presence of small insects, were all gone.</p>
<p>I knew it. Now that I’ve released Berserk, the Snow Maiden must have been able to demonstrate his ability to die instantly. No, I couldn’t say that he could die instantly from watching the battle against these giant types.</p>
<p>I also blocked the impact of the ball-shaped antidemon dragonkin explosions by blocking them.</p>
<p>I don’t know what kind of person she is, but she just killed it. Maybe it was a power that was not part of her skill’s range.</p>
<p>「Mulsani-san!」</p>
<p>Fran, who had been staring at the battlefield with bated breath, shouted sadly.</p>
<p>『Oh! Fran! Urushi, you get the adventurers!』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Fran, who had found the collapsing Pine Snow on the ground, ran off involuntarily. As was the case with the Hydrangea, she was strangely concerned about it, even though she had never told us anything about it before.</p>
<p>Hearing the story about a beautiful woman younger than a month from the Silver Lady, she had her own thoughts. She probably had no intention of pity for Fran. But I couldn’t help but feel something.</p>
<p>I couldn’t already feel any vicious magic power coming from Berserk. It seemed that his power was less than before it was released.</p>
<p>Had the Divine Sword Release worn Berserk’s power out too? If so, it might not be able to be used successively in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Well, it was unlikely that he’d use Berserk successively though.</p>
<p>The hydrangea had already picked her up when Fran had reached the bottom of the snowy area. Survivors of the old soldiers were already gathered around her.</p>
<p>They looked as if they were guarding a beautiful woman below the moon without any emotion as usual.</p>
<p>But upon closer inspection, I saw that the old men’s eyes were red. Some of them were suppressing their sorceress, and some were trembling slightly as they shook their spears.</p>
<p>I had a nasty imagination when I heard about her scabbard.</p>
<p>Sheaths of power only take effect after they have suffered some damage to the soldiers of the Militant Nation of Hagane. In other words, she may have sacrificed the old people.</p>
<p>When you think about the younger beauties, it seems like General Hagane is not hesitant to use up his forces. That’s not impossible.</p>
<p>However, I couldn’t imagine what kind of circumstances they would be sacrificed to, from the looks of the old people mourning for the death of Zelos Reed. I had thought of this in the previous battles, but I could sense the strength of those who were fighting on their own accord from these old people.</p>
<p>The atmosphere in the place was heavy.</p>
<p>「Mulsani-san.」</p>
<p>「Black Lightning Princess-san, isn’t it? I’m glad you didn’t get caught in it」</p>
<p>I didn’t ask her if she was okay. But it was obvious to everyone’s eyes that the light of life for this snow was about to go out.</p>
<p>Even though he didn’t seem to be breathing, his skin and hair were no longer glossy, and there was a blush under his eyes. However, he had lost his vitality.</p>
<p>She must have thought that she couldn’t let herself take away her last days.</p>
<p>「Thank you」</p>
<p>Fran thanked her a word and bowed her head deeply.</p>
<p>「......It’s fine, it’s all thanks to you.」</p>
<p>「But, thank you」</p>
<p>「I’m very happy because I didn’t expect anyone other than those from our country to thank me」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Hydrangea」</p>
<p>「What is it?」</p>
<p>「It was surprisingly not bad to die...... Why did the onee-sama and Urushi die smiling...? I now understand......」</p>
<p>But as the two continued their arguments, I remembered that we had talked about this same thing in the past somewhere.</p>
<p>「Mulsani-san, good night」</p>
<p>「Fufu... Take a break. It looks like I can have a good dream...」</p>
<p>The young girl, who had saved Fran and the others, fell into a long sleep with a peaceful look on her face.</p>
<p>「Black Lightning Princess, an Adventurer. Why are you crying?」</p>
<p>「......I don’t know.」</p>
<p>「Yeah.」</p>
<p>「A hydrangea, are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Don’t worry. This is our mission. Besides, they are sleeping happily. So, it’s not a problem」</p>
<p>Like the hydrangea said, the snowy hill seemed to be asleep. But her eyes would never open anymore.</p>
<p>Thanks to her, we had saved everyone. I wouldn’t be too exaggerated to say that we had saved their lives. She was the benevolent of not only Fran but also all the adventurers. The antidemon dragonkin she defeated were that powerful.</p>
<p>『Thank you very much』</p>
