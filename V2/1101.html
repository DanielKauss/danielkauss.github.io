</div><h1>Chapter 1101</h1><p>After defeating the undead under the name of Hydeman, we went back to the royal castle for now. We wanted to get some information about Hydeman to Dirk. There, we found a familiar face waiting for us. </p>
<p>「Fran!」</p>
<p>「Eliante!」</p>
<p> It’s Eliante, the guildmaster of the royal capital. But is he getting a little angry? </p>
<p>「Jeez! When you come to the royal capital, show me your face first, okay?」</p>
<p>「I was going to leave after this」</p>
<p>「I know it can’t be helped, but I want to tell you!」</p>
<p>「I know it can’t be helped, but I want to tell you!」</p>
<p>  Before we could go to say hello, we had accepted a request from Esmeralda at the royal castle. Eliante seemed to know that too, but she easily complained.  </p>
<p>「Most likely, there’s no way I could refuse the request of that Yokai Babaa. I’m just surprised to hear your name hastily been added to the participants of this request」</p>
<p>「You know Esmeralda?」</p>
<p>「Well, she’s a former Rank A adventurer, you know?  She retired when I became the guildmaster, but there are many legends. Even after I’ve served the royalty, there’s still a lot of legends behind it, right?」</p>
<p>  Since she was an underworld chief, Esmeralda rarely comes forward on her own. However, it seemed that there were plenty of incidents and legends that could be understood from what the listeners heard was the work of Esmeralda. </p>
<p>「The most famous one is the blood rat, who received his alias, right?」</p>
<p>「Blood rat?  Esmeralda’s alias, wasn’t she?」</p>
<p>「She’s a famous adventurer, mercenary, or knight.  It’s not just the Black Lightning Princess, there’s also the Black Cat Saintess, the Magic Sword girl, and many other things. Aah, it seems that Barbra is starting to call her </p>
<p>『Murdering the fleet』</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>  Eh?  When they crushed the fleet...  Really?  No, it was certainly because they crushed the fleet though. But the adventurers watched Fran’s fight, and there were also reports that she had sunk the fleet of Raydoss.  It would not be surprising if the adventurers had heard of that and called it that.  After all, they destroyed a large fleet of water dragonkin.  It was probably more important than we thought.  </p>
<p>「Esmeralda-san’s alias is particularly famous is the </p>
<p>『Summit』</p>
<p>  that you know. It’s got its name from the fact that she doesn’t move at all and uses sand to rule over a very large area.」</p>
<p>  When she was an adventurer, she had destroyed a large group of Kobolds while they were in the town.  After she became a stealthy scout, she used her ability to monitor the entire royal capital and clear up criminals and people in between them one after another. As a result, the alias of the seat became well known.  </p>
<p>「And the other famous one is the </p>
<p>『blood rat』</p>
<p>.  This one is also the nickname given to those who don’t like Esmeralda-san」</p>
<p>  Esmeralda sometimes killed them.  I don’t know if it could be called assassination, but it seemed that she could handle the serious criminals of the current crimes remotely. He was relentlessly hated by nobles as a dangerous person.  His killing method was to hunt the head using a sand rat.  The sand rat that Esmeralda unleashed instead of a scout quickly turned into an assassin and bit his head. It seems that he was getting called a blood rat by the nobles eventually, from the reddish-stained sand rats gushing out of his blood.  </p>
<p>「She sometimes calls herself a blood rat, but that’s why she’s so famous nowadays.」</p>
<p>「Hyaahaha!</p>
<p>「She sometimes calls herself a blood rat, but that’s why she’s so famous right now.」</p>
<p>「Hyah, hyah!  You’d better have a name with a nose, right?」</p>
<p>「!  When did you!?」</p>
<p>「I’m the one in charge of stealth, after all.  I’m very good at hiding my presence.」</p>
<p>  Eliante turned around in astonishment, and saw an esmeralda floating at the entrance to the room. In addition to her stealth techniques, she must have used a quiet sand chair to hide her presence further. Fran and I noticed, but Eliante didn’t notice the approach. </p>
<p>「You’d better not make too many requests to prevent the guild from going through, okay?」</p>
<p>「Come on, it’s a request letter」</p>
<p>「It’s not after all!  You’re using a pure kid! I’ve been hated by the other guildmasters!」</p>
<p>  Oops, he didn’t seem to have passed through the guild yet. I’m not criminalizing him, but I don’t want him to seem to be disrespecting the guild. No, I wonder if she’s okay with that, since Esmeralda seems to be telling her the right thing to do. </p>
<p>「But isn’t that more convenient for you guys?」</p>
<p>「What do you mean?」</p>
<p>「Black Lightning Princess’ reputation from our country has gone up a lot, you know? Are you happy?」</p>
<p> What are you talking about?  Is it a political matter between the guild and the country?  With strong adventurers, the authority of the guild can go up.  </p>
<p>「...How far can you see them?」</p>
<p>「Hyaaaaaaha!  After all, they’re just a monster asshole!」</p>
<p>「Y-you’ve heard me?」</p>
<p>「Anything bad about me that’s whispered in the royal capital is now my ears.」</p>
<p>  Esmeralda laughed and laughed, as if he was joking. Eliante fell silent with a wry smile on her face, perhaps thinking that she could not win even if she continued arguing with him. </p>
<p>「Gnrgh!」</p>
<p>「Hey.  You want to report me? Or do you already know?」</p>
<p>「Aah, sorry.  We’ve been talking in vain for a long time. </p>
<p>「Nn, it’s okay.」</p>
<p>  Eliante said something, but in the end, he didn’t open his mouth. He must have realized that he couldn’t win by mouth if he continued arguing with her.  In the meantime, Fran told Esmeralda everything she had gotten.  </p>
<p>「In the meantime, I heard the rumors in the sand, but it’s the Black Skeleton Corps.  They’re a troublesome opponent. They might find it easier to replenish if they’re undead.」</p>
<p>  Indeed, it may be possible to increase it with the bodies of strong people. We defeated the sixth seat this time, but there is a possibility that a new sixth seat will appear soon. </p>
<p>「I want to hear more about Hydeman from Dirk.」</p>
<p>「I’ve already heard that.」</p>
<p> It seems that Dirk had been interrogated before we returned.  He was said to be one of the top secretaries under the Southern Duke.  He said to be a very skilled stealth-specialized type that can be found everywhere. The loss of Dirk and that guy will probably weaken him considerably in information battles.  </p>
<p>「Hiyahaha, you’re a good one, Black Lightning Princess」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>「Anyway, I’m going to fulfill the request from the government now.</p>
<p>「It’s up to you what you want to do now.  If you’re going to work in the Royal Capital, there are other things I would like to ask for, and if you’re going to the north, I’ll write a letter of introduction to the lord of Alessa.</p>
<p>「It’s up to you what you want to do now. If you’re going to work in the Royal Capital, there are other things I would like to ask for, and if you’re going to the north, I’ll write a letter of introduction to the lord of Alessa. Well, I might not need it for you though」</p>
