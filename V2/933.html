</div><h1>Chapter 933</h1><p>Five days have passed since Fran woke up. She wanted to rest here slowly until the muscle pain was completely healed, but people around us didn’t leave Fran alone. It was Mea, who was coming this morning, who brought us a story. We met her every day, but she looked serious today. </p>
<p>「Fran, I’ve got a request」</p>
<p>「What is it?」</p>
<p>「...I-is that okay? I haven’t talked about anything yet, okay?」</p>
<p>「If Mea asked me, I’ll ask if it’s not impossible for me. I nodded my head first」</p>
<p> I nodded first」</p>
<p>「Fuhahaha!  As expected of my friend!  It’s not that reckless. I’m not always going to be reckless!」</p>
<p>  Mea smiled as she said so and turned to Urushi, who was standing next to Fran.  </p>
<p>「It might be better to ask Urushi to do this rather than Fran. I’d like to have him send a message to Nocta」</p>
<p>「Woof?」</p>
<p>『A message?  A magic tool isn’t enough?』</p>
<p>「This incident has destroyed all the magic tools in the guild, the Dragon King Syndicate, and the tower. The Dragon King must have been after that too.  The only way to contact them is to use messengers.」</p>
<p> Mea, Sophie, and Velmeria. They also discussed the Dragon King’s deed with the heads of the merchant association and the lady’s association.Mea, Sophie, and Velmeria, as well as the town’s leaders such as the head of the merchant association and the lady’s association, were discussing the plan to broadly appeal the Dragon King’s deed.  That’s why they decided to send trusted and fast-witted contacts to multiple cities.  </p>
<p>「Rindo has finally been resurrected.  I’ll leave as a message to the farther away.」</p>
<p>「Rindo, are you able to call him again?」</p>
<p>「Indeed! That’s why I want to get out of this town as soon as possible.」</p>
<p>『Oh, are you still pretty bad?』</p>
<p>「Rather, the resurrection of Lind has made things worse.」</p>
<p>  The fact that Mea’s sword was a Divine Sword had already become widely known. It was said that more than a hundred people attacked and thief attacked the Divine Sword, so it was, as expected, a Divine Sword.  However, it was the dragonkin who reacted more vehemently.  To them, the violent dragon sword, Lindwilm, was not just a mere weapon. Many dragonkin rushing over to Mea to show them their sword. At first, Mea and Quina used that flow to increase the influence of the Beastmen Union, but soon became fed up with the overly persistent dragonkin. Some of them even asked to give them to the dragonkin.  </p>
<p>「Quina eliminated them though.」</p>
<p>『Yeah.』</p>
<p>  They didn’t have any status on this continent, but they were just princessesses. If they wanted to give the divine swords of their royalty, they would have no choice but to ignore it.  Perhaps they heard rumors about the head being delivered to some kind of rebellious dragonkin organization......  I thought it was just a rumor, but it might be true! Afraid!  </p>
<p>「What’s wrong, Master?」</p>
<p>『No, it’s nothing. I was just thinking that I shouldn’t go against Quina』</p>
<p>「Ooh, and finally, Master has reached that level!  Hmm, you shouldn’t go against him, I don’t know what kind of punishment he’ll punish me!」</p>
<p>  She then glanced around, as if saying something like that. She was completely trained by Quina, wasn’t she?  </p>
<p>「I’m gonna let Quina talk about you and get back to work, okay?  I want Fran, who has Urushi’s leg, to go to Nocta. What do you think?」</p>
<p>「Master. Can I take it?  I’m worried about Auntie too」</p>
<p>『Fran, your muscular pains’ve healed, you’ll be fine』</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>  Urushi let his chest bent and cried as if to say, </p>
<p>「Leave it to me」</p>
<p>.” He must have gotten tired of living in the tatters of the tower.  </p>
<p>「Okay, I’ll bring you a letter that I’ll bring with me later. Leave it to me as soon as possible.」</p>
<p>「Nn.  Okay.」</p>
<p>『We’ll take care of it.』</p>
<p>「Also, you can do whatever you want if you don’t return to Sendia. There will be almost no antidemons in this area, so Fran will be bored.」</p>
<p>「Okay.」</p>
<p>「If only I could move......  Beat the antidemons to my heart’s content.」</p>
<p>「Nn!  Leave it to me!」</p>
<p> That’s fast.  In less than an hour, Mea returned with a bruise on her forehead, seemingly the remains of an iron claw, and she handed me multiple letters. It seems Quina had punished her for doing something.  Apparently, she brushed off a few words that conveyed the horror of Quina to me.  Ooh, and she doesn’t get angry with me, right? Anyway, I’ll just stay in Sendia until the air resistance started to cool. </p>
<p>「Okay, let’s go then」</p>
<p>「You can use Space-Time Magic, aren’t you? You’ll be able to move quickly after all」</p>
<p>「Fufun.  This is convenient」</p>
<p>「Fran, Master, and Urushi.  I’ll be counting on you!」</p>
<p> A whole day later, as we were heading for Nocta with Urushi on our backs, we saw a huge wall of familiarity.  </p>
<p>「I saw Nocta」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>『Just like before』</p>
<p>  Sendia was also attacked by such a horde.  Nocta may have been... I was worried, but I saw the same sight as before.  It seemed that it had successfully repelled all the antidemons. Adventurers and soldiers were tens of times larger than Sendia, so it was only natural.  Once inside, it was just as crowded as before. No, on the contrary, there were even more people walking along the road than before. It seemed that refugees from illegal villages like Castel and a large number of adventurers who were planning to stay here were also coming here.  Dwarves and demonkin were also visible. Maybe they heard that their queen was in this city and gathered here.  There was no atmosphere of the town after the war at all.  Could it be that Nocta wasn’t attacked?  While observing the surroundings, we headed for the Adventurers Guild. That’s when we met a familiar face.  </p>
<p>「Sis!」</p>
<p>「Diggins.」</p>
<p>  A bearman Rank B adventurer, Diggins, ran toward us with a happy look on his face. He was also one of our friends who had fought with us at Castel and had lost his lifeline.  I could see that Fran was happy to see Diggins again. He was treating us as a comrade in arms. </p>
<p>「Are you still in Nocta?」</p>
<p>「As long as you’re asked to do something about Nadia-san, you need to leave her alone in the middle of the fight!」</p>
<p> Apparently, they had been staying in Nocta to protect Nadia.  </p>
<p>「Are you okay with the antidemons in Nocta?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, there was one attack, but we managed to get through it together!  But there’s something strange about the antidemon season. I mean, there’s only a few attacks on Nocta......」</p>
<p>  Apparently, the Dragon King’s men were guiding all the antidemons near Nocta to Sendia. I’m sure there were too many of them.  </p>
<p>「What about Auntie?」</p>
<p>「Nadia-san hasn’t woken up yet.」</p>
<p>「I see......」</p>
<p>「Can I go to Mulsani’s husband’s mansion for now?」</p>
<p>(Master.  Can I go to Auntie first?)</p>
<p>『Yeah, I want to know her condition too.  Let’s go.』</p>
<p>「We’ll meet up at the Adventurers Guild again!」</p>
