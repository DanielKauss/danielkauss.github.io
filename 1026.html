</div><h1>Chapter 1026</h1><p>《The excess magic power will be returned to the individual named Master》</p>
<p>『What amazing magic power!』</p>
<p>《The current individual named Master can control it. Focus on the Great Magic Skill》</p>
<p>『O-ou!』</p>
<p>As Announcer-san said, it was possible to control it by holding a huge amount of magic power leaking out. It would dissipate over time, but we could just hit it all into our next attack.</p>
<p>However, while concentrating, there was something that was bothering me.</p>
<p>『Hey, Announcer-san. Did you call me the Provisional named Master?』</p>
<p>《Yes. By assimilating with the bearer of hope, the rank of existence has increased. As a result, the name was given from the Divine Area. We judged this to be an emergency and the notice is temporarily frozen》</p>
<p>「Are you sure? This is gonna be a long story」</p>
<p>This must be the same existence as Fran’s armor, right? And isn’t it a different kind of divine sword?</p>
<p>《The individual named Human Sword, Master, has become the true name. He is not a Divine Sword》</p>
<p>『W-well... Anyways, the name doesn’t change much. I mean, a human sword...?』</p>
<p>Wasn’t it dull? Wasn’t it that dull?</p>
<p>「Nn. But I can’t borrow the power of the tree sword」</p>
<p>Besides, is this just something we should be happy about?</p>
<p>『Doesn’t I have any disadvantages? For example, I can lose my emotions like the Me over there』</p>
<p>《No problems detected. All negative effects of naming will be defended by the individual named Announcer-san》</p>
<p>『I knew it! It really did have negative effects!』</p>
<p>Is she really okay? It would be bad if it affected her even a little!</p>
<p>《The increase in rationality and loss of emotion. These were originally the characteristics of the individual named Announcer-san, and now I have built a barrier based on the personality, emotion, and other data obtained from the power of the individual named Hope’s bearer. It is possible to prevent the individual named Master from becoming a sword》</p>
<p>『In other words, you don’t have to worry about it, Announcer-san looks like a machine originally, and now she has the power of a carrier of hope?』</p>
<p>《Affirmative.》</p>
<p>『Are you sure you’ll be okay?』</p>
<p>《No problems at all》</p>
<p>『Then, are you sure?』</p>
<p>As for the name, I would have hated it if it had become a completely different name, but it would still be Master that Fran gave me...... A human sword is no good!</p>
<p>I checked my status for a while, and indeed, it had changed. His name had changed from Master to Master, a human sword.</p>
<p>In addition, the skills and magician names that I’ve been indebted to since I came to this world have changed.</p>
<p>The name was just a little different, but the performance was much different. Obviously, the abilities of his skills had improved significantly.</p>
<p>I’m sure the power of her magic and the effects of her skills will increase even more than before. And that was not the only effect that she had inherited the power of the bearer of hope.</p>
<p>「Master, great magic power」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>To my surprise, my mana increased by 5,000, and so my mana conductivity increased to SS. In other words, I could wear my sword blade with more mana than ever before, and increase my attack power.</p>
<p>I planned to use Evil Crusher, Money-Style, Magic Control, and Evil Spirit Rush to strengthen myself and pass on my magic power to Fran and Urushi.</p>
<p>《Handing over a portion of the excess magic power to the individual named Fran and the individual named Urushi》</p>
<p>『Fran, Urushi. Are you okay? Don’t push yourself too hard, okay?』</p>
<p>「Nn! Don’t worry! I’ll make full use of it!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>As she said, Fran manipulated the magic power she had received from me and became her own. I was convinced that if the current Fran unleashed the Heaven Judgement from the Black Lightning Roll, she would be able to unleash the strongest strike in her history.</p>
<p>However, there was someone who could move ahead of Fran, who was still continuing to build up her strength.</p>
<p>This was Apollon.</p>
<p>「Sophie.」</p>
<p>「Surely, my oratorium has a weak ability to attack. But it’s not like I can’t fight you.」</p>
<p>This was Apollon.</p>
<p>It was a quiet sound. But it was filled with an enormous amount of Divine Energy. For some reason, it made me tremble. Was every sound that moved me? Or was it fear?</p>
<p>The saintess stood beside us in shock, surrounded by a large number of instruments.</p>
<p>I put my fingers on the small harp in my hand and played it with my claws. Then, as if in response, the instruments began to play a sound.</p>
<p>We started with the key, then the wooden wind, brass wind, and percussion, and the sound increased one after another. Then one day, dozens of instruments were sniffing perfectly, and majestic music echoed through the battlefield, as if they were being played by an orchestra.</p>
<p>The song was slow at first, but it gradually increased in speed and changed into a song so intense that it looked like hard rock or metal.</p>
<p>But that was not the end.</p>
<p>The ever-increasingly fast song turned into a song that made the audience feel uneasy, and eventually turned into a song so fast that they could not even catch the rhythm.</p>
<p>The magic power released without a pause became a wave that enveloped the battlefield and made it glow. However, the sound suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>I wondered what was going on, but it seems that it was just like a prelude before.</p>
<p>「Destroy, destruction. Destroy, destruction.」</p>
<p>A beautiful voice echoed from Sophie’s mouth in unison with the relaxed melody of the main melody.</p>
<p>「All things can not escape, it is the end.」</p>
<p>The mysterious yet sinister tone of her words was the result of a combination of the high-pitched hymns played by her instruments and the high-pitched voices of Sophie’s orchestra. This created a somewhat disturbing concert.</p>
<p>「Everyone lament, sorrow, fear, destruction.」</p>
<p>The song of adventurers that I had heard before was a song of vitality that made me feel positive for the future. However, this must be an annihilated song, just like the lyrics said. There were some sounds of hope in the music, others of despair.</p>
<p>《Tentative name: Giant antidemon status has decreased. In addition, internal magic power has decreased》</p>
<p>If the effect was completely different, and the adventurer’s song was the top buff type that strengthened our comrades, then the song of destruction had a debuff effect that weakened the power of our enemies.</p>
<p>Sophie’s voice was transformed into blueish-black light and struck many times by the giant antidemons. Each time I did that, I could feel the magic power possessed by the giant antidemons diminishing.</p>
<p>Moreover, was his body being gradually whittled down? It was beginning to crumble away as if the antidemons’ bodies were starting to fade away.</p>
<p>「Come now, destroy me! And follow your orders!」</p>
<p>Many of them stopped attacking and just stood there, be it in awe or in fear of being enraptured.</p>
<p>Sophie’s song had an effect, and the presence of the giant antidemons was clearly less than before. However, there was someone else who weakened as well.</p>
<p>「My madness is like a curse!」</p>
<p>Blood tears gushed out of both Sophie’s eyes as she shouted. In addition, she had a pale face and blood loss from her lips.</p>
<p>The backlash from her annihilated song must have been erasing Sophie’s vitality. But Sophie did not stop singing. She continued her oratorium performance, shouting from the position of King Neidhart.</p>
<p>As my claws cracked and peeled, and blood began to overflow and dyed the harp strings bright red, the song of destruction finally ended.</p>
<p>「It’s like an end, huh!? Damn, it’s annihilated!」</p>
<p>I was born several decades ago, it seems. Not that it means much to me considering how I don’t remember living that long myself.</p>
<p>Immediately after spitting out her last words, Sophie fell to the ground, bleeding from her mouth and eyes.</p>
