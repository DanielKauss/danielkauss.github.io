</div><h1>Chapter 1018</h1><p>The giant antidemon, unable to get up, began to make some kind of strange movement. It had loosened from its limbs and began to twitch its entire body.</p>
<p>However, it was a super huge body, as big as a high-rise building, that was vibrating. Just from the shivering body, a tremendous shaking was also occurring around it.</p>
<p>Even the dwarves, who should have had strong legs, were trembling to the point that they could no longer move. Wouldn’t it be bad if they were attacked in this state?</p>
<p>Orfalve and Jayne knew just how bad this was, and immediately evacuated their underlings. Though they fell many times, they slowly moved away from the giant antidemons.</p>
<p>As people disappeared from the surrounding area, Ader attacked her, but she still could not stop the spasms.</p>
<p>The spasms gradually increased in intensity, and a change came suddenly to the giant antidemons.</p>
<p>While making a cracking sound, his body began to transform. There was a high-pitched, heavy noise, as if a huge steel strip had been twisted. It seemed that something was happening deep inside his body that could generate such a sound.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, the figure of the giant antidemon had been greatly transformed. It had the same coloring and size. However, it was not a human-type like before, but an insect-like multi-legged form.</p>
<p>Her torso was probably almost the same shape as before.</p>
<p>Her limbs were not shaped like a grab, but rather like an insect, thin, long, and with many jointed limbs. In addition to her previous limbs, she had one from each side, and one from the butt.</p>
<p>There was not much change from the neck up to the torso, but the neck had been slightly transformed and extended from the back of the head to the torso.</p>
<p>It’s a creepy deformity, but it makes sense. This way, there’s little risk of him losing his footing due to an intensive strike.</p>
<p>It seemed that she also had the ability to change the shape of her body to match the situation.</p>
<p>「Ghrooowl!」</p>
<p>「Shield!」</p>
<p>「「「「Yeah!」」」」</p>
<p>The dwarven shield army activated their shield techniques at once. At about the same time, a glob of evil energy was released from the mouth of the giant antidemon.</p>
<p>The evil energy, which radiated like a dragon’s breath, was held back by the pale blue magic shield. Not only did it transform into a weaker sword, but it seemed that the way it was attacked had changed.</p>
<p>She must have acquired an attack that was easier to deal with large armies. Immediately after the shield techniques disappeared, one of her legs was now gone.</p>
<p>The dwarves reacted quickly and readied their shields again, but could not completely block this heavy blow.</p>
<p>Nearly a hundred dwarves were blown away and lying on the ground.</p>
<p>His legs were a little thinner, but they were more than ten meters in diameter. If someone had wiped him out with such a heavy object, there would have been less damage. However, it was the most damage we had suffered so far.</p>
<p>「I’ll keep my distance for now! This position is too dangerous for me!」</p>
<p>「I will draw our attention! In the meantime, join up with the rest of you!」</p>
<p>After the transformation of the giant antidemons, they lost their advantage in close range. The queen immediately decided on this.</p>
<p>The dwarves bravely moved forward, trying to buy time for everyone else to evacuate.</p>
<p>Despite their poor condition, the dwarves made no noise or complain. They continued to walk forward, chasing Orfalve, who was leading the way.</p>
<p>I don’t think we will have time to hesitate here. While we were hesitating, the dwarves only suffered more damage. However, the giant antidemons began to move in new ways, as if we were reading them.</p>
<p>「Wrrrooof!」</p>
<p>「You’ve jumped!」</p>
<p>The giant antidemon, with its seven legs folded in half, had jumped like a locust.</p>
<p>He landed surprisingly little impact, and braced himself to block our way back. Judging from the distance we’re currently flying, it seems we won’t be able to escape with just running.</p>
<p>We were finally getting pushed back. Should we try to win with simultaneous attacks now? We were out of the castle barrier at least once, so we could use the Dimension Gate. However, if we used Space-time Magic here to keep our troops away from us, we would be caught up in no time.</p>
<p>The bigger the antidemons, the more mana they supply and become stronger as time goes by. The more time you waste, the less you’ll be at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>That was what everyone knew, and that’s why their expressions were so strict.</p>
<p>Everyone was wondering what to do, and stopped for just a moment. But still, there was a man who did not stop moving.</p>
<p>「It seems like I have no choice but to defeat it. You can watch from there」</p>
<p>It was Adar, the Divine Sword Knight of the Holy Nation of Silard. He walked forward towards the giant antidemons with Divine Power rising all over his body. It seemed that he had been gathering power for a long time, and the Divine Power was completely covering his entire body.</p>
<p>「Wait. If they’re going to attack, we should all join forces. We’ll cover for them」</p>
<p>「Unwanted.」</p>
<p>「Ah, let’s wait!」</p>
<p>Orfalve and Jayne tried to hold him back, but Ader did not stop.</p>
<p>Immediately after, Addle’s figure vanished. Addle jumped up at a speed that even we could not follow, and in the next moment, she was right in front of the giant antidemons.</p>
<p>It seems that even he couldn’t catch Addle’s super godly speed. He looked somewhat surprised. However, he immediately extended his legs after showing a tremendous reaction speed.</p>
<p>Four of his legs had been attacked from all sides――to crush Ader. It seems that Ader had sliced through all of them, but we couldn’t even see his slash.</p>
<p>No matter how many times I’ve seen him, he’s still strange in his released Alpha state. I don’t want to fight that kind of thing.</p>
<p>I wonder what kind of technique that Ader was willing to use to build up his power and unleash it... Since there was no way to stop him now, all I could do was to watch. Of course, she was building up her strength to pursue him.</p>
<p>「Evil God Slash, Divine Sword Technique」</p>
<p>What a straightforward name! But the attack was exactly the same evil power as the name. Anyone would be able to tell by looking at it.</p>
<p>The Divine Attribute on her blade made the Alpha, which looked more than twice as long, swung down from above.</p>
<p>What she was doing might be similar to Fran’s Heaven Judgement. It was a slash with divine speed, and it was clothed in the divine attribute.</p>
<p>But the power contained in it was so enormous that we could not twist it no matter how much we did.</p>
<p>A white flash of light dyed the surroundings, closing everyone’s eyes. Then, a moment later, a terrifying impact shook the earth.</p>
<p>More than half of the troops were collapsed in just one tremor. The storm-like wave of magic power that rushed in right after it shoved down the other half. Even though all of them were elites, they were standing here.</p>
<p>They couldn’t stand. It was caused by the only slash that Adoll unleashed. But the true impact came after them.</p>
<p>What Fran and Urushi saw after their vertigo subsided was a terrible sight.</p>
<p>「......Amazing.」</p>
<p>「W-woof.」</p>
<p>「I knew it, a Divine Sword is unbreakable」</p>
<p>「Even a Divine Sword must be specialized in direct combat to do that」</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but be surprised to hear all of their voices.</p>
<p>What was there was the figure of a giant antidemon that had been whittled down by about 70% of its body on the right side of its body, with only its side stomach and the three legs that grew out of it remaining.</p>
<p>Moreover, there was a deep, straight valley that continued for a long time behind it. A deep valley had been drilled into it as if it had existed before.</p>
<p>It was so long that I couldn’t see into the future. Was it all done by one person?</p>
<p>A similar scene had been created in the Black Tiger Lightning Rush, the trump card that Fran had used to turn into a Divine Beast. However, this one was wider, deeper, and longer.</p>
<p>I stopped thinking in surprise, and then Fran and Urushi ran off of the spot. They had found Addle lying on the ground.</p>
<p>There was no smile on everyone’s faces, including Fran.</p>
<p>『Even though it looks like that, can you still defeat it!?』</p>
<p>The giant antidemons had begun to regenerate. The warriors returned to me and attacked each leg. But with a normal attack, it would be difficult to regenerate them.</p>
<p>『Shit! Once Jayne and the others can prepare the ritual magic!』</p>
