</div><h1>Chapter 1022</h1><p>While glaring at the giant antidemons falling from the sky, Ashwrath put more power into his hand, which was holding the Earth Sword Gaia. The muscles in his body grew wider and stronger. His muscular body now seemed like a lump of muscle. He twisted his body and held his huge hammer-like head so that it would be deflected by the ground. It was similar to a backswing from playing golf, huh? In that state, I could see that he was concentrating his magic power on the Divine Sword. Ashwrath seemed to be planning to intercept the giant antidemons. Ashwrath seemed to be planning to intercept the giant antidemons.  Both of them contained super energy that was not even close to our feet.  I wonder what kind of do these clashes will cause? </p>
<p>『Run, run!』</p>
<p>  I urged Fran to hurry.  She urged her to hurry.  Even though we had gotten a lot farther away, her danger detection was still ringing.  A few seconds after we started running, Fran was supposed to be at her full speed, but she felt slow. That frustration shook me even more.  It was already catching up with Orfalve and the others.  </p>
<p>「Guys!  Run!」</p>
<p>「It’s already too late!  Shields! Get to the front!」</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Yeah!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>  Fran decided to stay with them here.  Behind the dwarves, she paused.  </p>
<p>『Fran! Let’s use resonant magic!』</p>
<p>(Got it!)</p>
<p> Our resonated with flame and wind magic. It wasn’t an attack, but a defensive spell.  Flame barriers blocking flame heat and wind shields blocking wind. By resonating with each other, we created a huge wall to weaken the blast.  Even if it can’t be completely blocked, if we can weaken it even a little, it will help the Dwarf Shield Corps. </p>
<p>「A wide area impact barrier!」</p>
<p>  Seliadot also deployed a huge barrier. It seems that she had been quietly building up her power so that she could respond when the time comes. Immediately after our resonant magic and Seliadot’s barrier deployed as a double wall in front of the dwarves, a shooting star crashed into the air. It must have been the result of Ashwrath’s interception that she seemed to have slowed down just before the Great Magic Beast collided with the earth. A tremendous explosion ensued, and flashes of light, shock, and debris swept through the earth.  The walls we had set up were destroyed in an instant.  Seliadot’s wards managed to hold in a little, but that didn’t last for a second. The shields of magic the dwarves thrust out were also scraped off at once, but still, the dwarves managed to withstand it. But thanks to this, there was no major damage.  Some of them were injured from the rubble, but no one died. The demonkin moved quickly to heal the injured.  Leaving the first aid to them, we wiped out the dust around us with wind magic right away in preparation for the attack of the giant antidemons. A surprising scene came to our eyes.  The earth had been greatly cut down. The only place we stood was safe thanks to the dwarves, but the area around us was a notch below us as if we had been dug out by heavy equipment.  It continued on for a long time. In fact, the place where we were standing was probably a magnitude higher than the surrounding area.  The shockwave must have scraped off the ground.  But it was much better than the blast zone.  It had a very huge hole. The antidemons must have focused most of the impact of the clash directly below them. If this energy had been released all around us, we wouldn’t have been able to get through this either.  And although the most important players were the giant antidemons, they were lying a little farther away from the big hole.  Their bodies, which had been straight like the full moon, had been shattered and gouged. It must have lost about 70% of its volume, hadn’t it? The nuclear part had disappeared with some of the surface parts still remaining.  However, its magic power had not been lost. It seemed that regeneration had already begun inside.  Ashwrath, on the other hand, was lying right next to the large hole.  His whole body was burned and he was motionless.  </p>
<p>「Ashwrath!」</p>
<p>  He rushed over to check it and found that he was barely alive. His arms had been lost and the lower half of his body had been crushed.  But it was saved if he was still alive.  In the first place, his regeneration had already begun. However, we were in a great hurry to heal him.  We were prepared to use all of our magic power, and continued to use it.  </p>
<p>「... The light of the horns has stopped.」</p>
<p>『Yeah, it’s dangerous......』</p>
<p>  The horns on Ashwrath’s forehead were shining red as he collapsed, adding more strength. He must have been on the verge of death of his host, and his Mad Ogre was about to be triggered.  His wounds were healed, and he seemed to have stopped him.  </p>
<p>『I don’t know what will happen if Ashwrath rampages right now.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p> I hope Ashwrath can attack the giant antidemons and defeat them, but it won’t be that convenient. But it won’t be that convenient.  There is a high possibility that they will attack our forces and cause great damage. If that happens, our comrades would be destroyed, and the antidemons would be completely resurrected.  </p>
<p>『Fran, we’re going too. We’ll have to take them down here, or we’ll be in trouble.』</p>
<p>  Ashwrath woke up and didn’t know if he could fight again. He had to stop him now.  Leaving Ashwrath to the approaching adventurers, Fran joined up with the dwarves. But the attacks did not go as he wanted.  They were not ready for combat, and they did not have enough fire to extinguish the antidemons. The situation was the same as when Adoll took the lead.  Mea and the others we depended on were blown away by the blast and no one knew where they were. I didn’t think they were dead......  All the army was starting to show signs of impatience. The recovery of the giant antidemons was beginning to exceed our attacks.  Once they were fully recovered, we really won’t have anything to do.  What can I do? The only way I could think of a counterattack was to let Sophie escape on her own and intercept the giant antidemons in Nocta, where she could use the adventurer’s song.  Many people would die, but there was no other plan that could win.  Just as I was thinking about this, a girl came down from the carriage. It looked as if the soldiers had taken their lives to protect her, and there was almost no damage.  Yes, we had forgotten about her.  </p>
<p>「Hydrangea」</p>
<p>「Yeah, you, kid.  I’ll leave the rest to you」</p>
<p>「... Understood」</p>
<p>「... Please leave it to me」</p>
<p>「Maybe we’ll get caught up in it.  I’m sorry」</p>
<p>  The hydrangea bowed her head to the dwarves and demonkin around her with an out-of-place look on her face. Then, she drew her divine sword.  </p>
<p>「Hydrangea!」</p>
<p>「Fran.  We part here.  In order for Berserk to return to his country, we must defeat him.Yeah, we’ve forgotten about her. </p>
<p>「Hydrangea」</p>
<p>「Yeah, you little one. I’ll leave the rest to you」</p>
<p>「...Understood」</p>
<p>「...Please leave it to me」</p>
<p>「Maybe I’ll get caught up in it. I’m sorry」</p>
<p> The hydrangea bowed her head to the dwarves and demonkin around her with an out-of-place appearance. Then, she drew her divine sword. </p>
<p>「Hydrangea!」</p>
<p>「Fran. We part here. In order for Berserk to return to his country, we must defeat him. I’ll put a stop to him」</p>
