</div><h1>Chapter 1047</h1><p>「Young miss, it was a really hard time for me. I’ve got the report and I’m satisfied with the work she did. I’ve accomplished the request. I’ll also give you a bonus for paying」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「But still, our trip to Gordisia was very impressive. Thanks to you and Hilt’s party, I was able to save you a lot」</p>
<p>Fran was facing Brunen in the captain’s office.</p>
<p>It was a boat trip that we had free time to go to, but our return was different. So, we would have to write the documents and report that we had to submit on our return ship on our way back.</p>
<p>Like Fran, she got burned up halfway through.</p>
<p>Even on the continent of Gordicia, I couldn’t see Fran’s eyes that lackluster.</p>
<p>However, it was also worth it, and the request Fran had accepted was completely fulfilled.</p>
<p>「We can’t even hold a party here, but we’re leaving empty-handed.」</p>
<p>「We have no choice」</p>
<p>「I wanted to tell you to go back, but that would be difficult. You have to get to the border as soon as you get back home」</p>
<p>「Work?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. It looks like the border won’t let us through, so the bird came all the way in to inform us」</p>
<p>border with Belioth? I think it also borders with some countries?</p>
<p>「Raidos?」</p>
<p>「That’s right. I heard that there will be large-scale seminars in the country over there. I don’t think they’ll suddenly cross the border...」</p>
<p>「Raidos could do it.」</p>
<p>「That’s how it works. Thanks to that, those in the general ranks should wait at the border in case of emergencies」</p>
<p>「At the north gate, it seems the outlaws were reluctant to send out their forces because of the impending war between gangs.」</p>
<p>「All of the rewards were money, you know?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Then I’ll send the money to your guild account. It was a great help this time. It was also thanks to you that I was able to make a connection with Hilt and the others.」</p>
<p>Apparently, Brunen has made a re-deal with Hilt and the others. The addition of an A-Ranked adventurer to the defense of the border would be the best deterrent for us.</p>
<p>「Thank you very much」</p>
<p>「Likewise」</p>
<p>Finally, Brunen shook her hand and left the captain’s office. With this, everything about Gordicia was over.</p>
<p>Fran extorted, looking cheerful. She no longer had to write any documents, and she must be feeling liberated now.</p>
<p>『Uwaah, that’s it. When we got back to the continent of Zilberd, we’ll go to the Academy of Magic』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>That’s where I got the Heavenly Dragon’s materials after all. That was my first goal.</p>
<p>『I’m also interested in Raydoss’s moves, but we can ask Weena about that too』</p>
<p>「Alessa, are you okay?」</p>
<p>『Well, Amanda and Jean are here, so I’m sure they’ll be fine. Klimt is there too』</p>
<p>If we wanted to make it through town, we would need someone of Rank S ability.</p>
<p>「Yeah.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>「I’ll be able to fix this when we get back to the Academy of Magic」</p>
<p>『Isn’t it safe to go to the Royal Capital?』</p>
<p>What Fran took out was a broken mug. It was a memento with her parents that she had dug out at Castel.</p>
<p>Alchemists were not captured on the busy continent of Gordicia. They said that they would ask the dwarves to fix them if they wanted, but I would have to ask the royalty to do something like that, right?</p>
<p>In the end, they decided to look for the alchemist slowly when they returned to the continent of Jilbard.</p>
<p>『There’s got to be a lot of alchemists in the Royal Capital of Belios after all』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran clutched her stomach, perhaps relieved by my words.</p>
<p>「I’m hungry」</p>
<p>『Then let’s have our food!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>That’s how calm the boat trips were for the few days after all.</p>
<p>After a little while, the ship was in a hurry on the continent of Jilbard. It seemed that the ship was not preparing to call at the harbor.</p>
<p>We went out onto the deck and asked the crew members about it.</p>
<p>「What’s wrong?」</p>
<p>「The harbor is on fire!」</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>I see now, I can see the red light quite far away. It was still visible as a point, but it stood out in the darkness of the night.</p>
<p>Many of the crew members had long-range skills. They must have made sure that the source of the fire was the harbor.</p>
<p>And that was not the only strange thing.</p>
<p>「The fleet is coming! It looks like we’ve been completely captured!」</p>
<p>「Fleet?」</p>
<p>Now that she mentioned it, I could see the ship coming from the direction of the red flames. She must have found the light of this ship.</p>
<p>And what about the crew’s panic――.</p>
<p>「Enemy?」</p>
<p>「I will hold up the emblem of the Kingdom of Raidos. And the emblem of the Sea Kingdom of Sydran too」</p>
<p>『Seedrun, huh? Certainly, it was a sea-based country in the west of the Kranzel Kingdom, right?』</p>
<p>It was supposed to be a country that possessed a powerful battle ship called the Water Dragon Ship and was one of the world’s leading naval forces. It had once fought against the Royal Family, which had lost a political battle in the Seedrun Sea Kingdom and had escaped.</p>
<p>「So the Raidos Kingdom and the Sea Kingdom of Sydran are on the same page?」</p>
<p>「 Apparently, Raidos made Seedrun subordinate.」</p>
<p>So, this was practically the naval force of Raidos, huh?</p>
<p>「What about the water dragonkin?」</p>
<p>「I don’t understand. But they’re clearly chasing after us, and they’re not very calm by any stretch of the imagination...」</p>
<p>I guess that meant they were on the run.</p>
<p>There is no way they will be captured by an army ship of the Raidos Kingdom and this will be a good outcome. They should certainly run away.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there was no water dragonkin around, so we managed to escape. Apparently, they had no intention of catching anything in the first place.</p>
<p>Since it was the ship of Belioth, their enemy, they must have been following him for the time being.</p>
<p>「Hmmm. You’ve come a lot south.」</p>
<p>「Yeah. It’s already in the south of the continent of Zilberd」</p>
<p>「The food is pretty tough. We’ve got seven more days to spare. We’ll have to stock up on it somewhere else」</p>
<p>Brunen and the other vice-commanders were discussing the future, with the map in front of them along with the forehead.</p>
<p>I caught three presences with bloodlust lurking around. But the fact that I can detect them this easily suggests that they are not that skilled.</p>
<p>In the first place, in order to return to Belios, a land-locked country, we would have to call at the harbor somewhere and travel by land route.</p>
<p>However, we could not leave the ship with someone we didn’t even know if we could trust. And it would be quite difficult to move north of the south even if we were to move by land.</p>
<p>That makes it convenient for a country that is trustworthy and close to Belioth.</p>
<p>「It’s the Kingdom of Kranzel」</p>
<p>「That’s probably the only way. The small countries in the south don’t know who is connected to Raidos Kingdom」</p>
<p>And so, we hurriedly decided to head for Barbra, a port city in the Kranzel Kingdom.</p>
