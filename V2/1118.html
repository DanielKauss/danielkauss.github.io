</div><h1>Chapter 1118</h1><p>It seemed that it had made things a little easier for her to tell Klimut about me. Fran had a bright look on her face as she was hunting. I guess she had been wondering about that for a long time. And the day after she provided more meat to Alessa, Fran was meeting with the cargo transportation unit that she was planning to lead. There were quite a few fully equipped adventurers and mercenary-looking men in Alessa’s square. Some of them looked pretty strong, I’m sure there were more than 50 people in all. Some of them looked pretty strong.  There were probably more than 50 people in all.  I had imagined more civilians since I was told that they were valiant soldiers, but...  Many of them were active adventurers or mercenaries who had a grudge against Raydoss. They were probably willing to participate in the request but were not motivated to participate.They were eager to participate in the request, but it was hard to say that they were full of motivation.  As I was observing them chatting in a vulgar atmosphere, I saw two men and women approaching us.  The man was a small warrior carrying a spear that emitted strong magical power.  Apparently, he was a human.  His face was hidden because of his metal head, but he had no claws, no horns, no tails, and rounded ears. He was about 160 cm tall, quite small.  He was thin and at first glance, but the armor he wore was that of a vanguard. He was wearing a spear longer than his height and leather armor that strengthened his vital points.  It was a mask-type head equipment with three side slits around his eyes.  However, it was gracefully shaped with a lot of curves and had no martial arts at all. I could tell that it was a man by the way his muscles were attached, but I didn’t feel much strength.  He didn’t have an atmosphere that could be called a strong person, but he had a strange presence. It was only my intuition, but it looked quite strong.  Female―― Or rather, maybe even the girl was a human being, huh?  She had long, beautiful blond hair that looked like an elf, but her ears were round. She was also unable to see her face because she was wearing a mask.  She was about 13 cm tall and had thin, small arms and legs.  She didn’t look like an adult.  She was carrying a white robe or a wooden walking staff, and this girl seemed to be a rearguard.  I wonder what she was capable of. She also seemed to be quite good at martial arts.  Since the masks were similar, there was no doubt that these two were friends. The contrast between a black-skinned man and a white-skinned girl was a strangely picture.  </p>
<p>「Hmm?  Nom nom.」</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>「Bryne, Fran-dono, the Black Lightning Princess, right?」</p>
<p>  They approached us in a straight line and called out to us with an easy-going attitude. Well, the only people who could speak were men, and the girls only quietly refrained from doing so. </p>
<p>「I’m the one who will be your guide this time」</p>
<p>「High-ranking adventurer with an eccentric personality?」</p>
<p>『Wha, Fran-san? Nell-san said something like that, but you shouldn’t tell her about it!』</p>
<p> Then Fran shook her head, looking as if she had noticed something.  </p>
<p>「I wasn’t talking about anything strange」</p>
<p>  She said that.  Now we can still fake it!  </p>
<p>「A lot of things have happened, but she said that she was not a bad person」</p>
<p>『You’re not changing!』</p>
<p>  However, the man was smiling. It was not a wry smile, but it was really fun.  </p>
<p>「Hahahaha, this is tough. But I’m told that even this is the better one among Rank A adventurers」</p>
<p>「Is it Rank A?」</p>
<p>  Seriously?  If so, it’s hiding his abilities quite well.  Moreover, is he aware that he’s a little strange? Indeed, they might be better than any Rank A.  </p>
<p>「Yes, I’m not a member of this country, but I call myself a Mareficent.  I’ve been calling myself a weirdo, like </p>
<p>『Kuh?』</p>
<p> , </p>
<p>『Old man』</p>
<p>Mareficent the Black Knight! Ashwrath said he was an adventurer who had a skill eraser to erase his opponent’s skills!  </p>
<p>「Are you Mareficent, the person Ashwrath knows?」</p>
<p>「Right, you mean him?  He’s talking about me after all.  He’s saying something about me, right? Whether it’s annoying, clingy, or disgusting」</p>
<p>「?  He’s not saying it」</p>
<p>「Really?  That person has also rolled up, hasn’t he?  Well, that’s fine. I look forward to working with you on the way, Black Lightning Princess-dono」</p>
<p>「Nn.  Nice to meet you」</p>
<p>  He’s a person who smells like a huh.  He has a super low waist due to his Rank A habit. I don’t feel any malice, but his attitude was too light and he was puzzled.  Fran’s gaze then turned to the girl behind Mareficent. Then Mareficent would introduce her to us.  </p>
<p>「As you can see, she’s quiet, so I’ll introduce you. She’s Persona, and she’s my partner」</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>「Even though she looks like this, she’s still a B-ranked adventurer with the alias of </p>
<p>『Kuh, appraisal killer』</p>
<p> and </p>
<p>『She’s just a whitepaper』</p>
<p>  She seemed to be really quiet, and the girl bowed her head quietly without saying anything. I didn’t feel any hostility coming from her either, but she just couldn’t see her expression because her face was hiding in the mask.  </p>
<p>「An Appraisal Slayer?」</p>
<p>「Yeah.  She has an Extra Skill too.  And Appraisal-type skills are automatically blocked around her. The name comes from the fact that nothing about Appraisal-type magic tools are copied.」</p>
<p>  It would be quite convenient if it would work on her comrades. It doesn’t leak any of our power at all.  Well, it doesn’t seem to be the only benefit since it automatically activates.  I tried appraising myself on a trial basis, but it only showed that I couldn’t appraise. It was an Extra Skill, and I guess it was quite powerful.  </p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>  Fran and Persona stared at each other silently.  Then Fran bowed her head as if to say hello to them.But that’s not all we can trust, so we’ll just sit tight for the time being.</p>
