</div><h1>Chapter 948</h1><p>The Silver Lady had suddenly appeared and advised us to be careful with the Holy Nation of Silard.</p>
<p>What do you mean? I don’t know where she is right now. I’ve made no attempts to antagonize her at all... But can I trust her?</p>
<p>「...So it’s useful?」</p>
<p>「Those who have strong healing abilities or skills that can be inherited in their bloodline. And those that his country is particularly focusing on are magical tools that can give powerful skills to their wielder」</p>
<p>Crap, the last one I’ve seen. It’s probably one of the best skills in the world when it comes to the number of skills given to my equipment.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, compatibility with Alpha was way too great! If I could get both Alpha and me at the same time, I’d be in some serious trouble.</p>
<p>「At any rate, we need to take her to a place where she can rest. What do you think?」</p>
<p>「Can you use Addle to appraise me?」</p>
<p>In some cases, we would have to keep avoiding Ader for as long as we were on this continent. We may have to consider leaving Gordicia immediately.</p>
<p>Fran didn’t want to get an answer, she just wanted to hear her opinion. But the Silver Lady assured her.</p>
<p>「I’m looking for that」</p>
<p>「Really? Appraisal came in handy」</p>
<p>I’d say Silard would at least be able to screen or kidnap a child with an appraisal.</p>
<p>「It’s too convenient. They’ll find out everything about the darkness and ugliness of the country after all」</p>
<p>As expected, the country is also wary of Alpha’s wielder.</p>
<p>It would be terrible if the Divine Sword Knights aspire to make a breakthrough. They would be the ones who can reject our national army even head-on. If they betrayed us, there was no way we could stop them.</p>
<p>That was probably why they didn’t want to give any gloomy information about the country. Great powers couldn’t have any filthy parts. And Silard was simply guilty.</p>
<p>I’m sure Adel has some idea of doing the dirty work for his country too. But I don’t think he really knows what the dark side is.</p>
<p>What if someone like that knew the true nature of their homeland? There was a good chance that they would betray her. Perhaps they had already failed.</p>
<p>It seems that the Divine Sword Knight’s perceptive power when using Alpha had been enhanced without a hitch. It was said that he could see through all kinds of things after all. With Appraisal Skills, he would be able to see through all kinds of information.</p>
<p>Considering the various dangers, it was no wonder he came to the conclusion that Silard would not give an appraisal to the Divine Sword Knight. For the country, the strength of the battlefield was probably the most important, and weapons were a unnecessary thing to do.</p>
<p>Still, I don’t think it’s possible to completely block information...... They must have taken various other measures to prevent that from happening.</p>
<p>But wouldn’t it be reassuring if someone from Ader didn’t have an appraisal?</p>
<p>We were relieved, but actually, we were not.</p>
<p>「Silard has a department to help you find useful people. We have several people with appraisal skills with us on this expedition, so make sure they don’t leak any information to us. You have a high level of recovery magic and a high fighting prowess. That’s what Silard wants.」</p>
<p>「Can’t I have an Appraisal Jammer?」</p>
<p>「Depends on the skill you possess, some of them may even break through the Appraisal Jammer」</p>
<p>Well, sometimes we can ignore the Appraisal Blocking thanks to Heavenly Eye too. It also depends on the opponent’s ability and status, so we can’t be sure about that though.</p>
<p>That’s true for us too. If someone had a higher-ranked Appraisal Skill, they could have stolen some of their stats.</p>
<p>Will she allocate her points to skills that would prevent the opponent’s appraisal? Will she Superiorize Appraisal Obstruction and Appraisal Disguising? But that would weaken Fran’s own preparation for appraisal.</p>
<p>I hope that Superiorized Skills could also affect Fran, but...</p>
<p>While I was wondering what to do, the Silver Lady offered me something. At first glance, it looked like a silver bracelet without any decoration.</p>
<p>「What’s this?」</p>
<p>「This is a magical tool that has the effect of blocking appraisal. It is a first-rate product made by the Divine level blacksmith Zechs, so I can guarantee the effect. I’ll give it to you, so please use it」</p>
<p>「...Why?」</p>
<p>「Like I said before, I am grateful to you. Thanks to you, I have lost my reason for existence.」</p>
<p>I’ve heard those words before.</p>
<p>For some reason, she was thanked when she destroyed Overgrowth. She had robbed the Silver Lady of her reason for existence.</p>
<p>But I didn’t understand why would they thank us for that.</p>
<p>「Why would you thank me?」</p>
<p>「...I don’t know」</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>「Now that Overgrowth has disappeared, I will no longer be active in the distant future」</p>
<p>No, that’s why I appreciate it.</p>
<p>「When I understood that, I was relieved. Yes, that must be relief. It was me, who was only given a pseudo and limited emotion to understand the emotions of the wielder... But I definitely wanted to break it. To put it another way, I wanted to die. For a long time.」</p>
<p>There was no trace of emotion on the Silver Lady’s face as she said that as if she was whispering. However, I could feel a hint of cheerfulness on her face.</p>
<p>「Thanks to you, I can break. I can complete my mission. I can unload my shoulders. That’s why I appreciate you.」</p>
<p>Said the Silver Lady while bowing her head deeply.</p>
<p>「...I believe in you」</p>
<p>『Oi, Fran. It certainly doesn’t sound like you’re lying, but...』</p>
<p>(Don’t worry, she’s not lying.)</p>
<p>Because she was a golem, the Principle of Falsehoods wouldn’t do her job. However, Fran decided to trust the Silver Lady.</p>
<p>Could it be because of some wild intuition? Her senses have been sharpened ever since she became a Divine Beast.</p>
<p>My appraisal failed on the silver bracelet she was offered. And when Fran received the bracelet, the appraisal passed on to the Silver Lady.</p>
<p>She really is a golem. But I don’t know if that’s gonna happen in the future, so I wonder?</p>
<p>When Fran asked her about that, the Silver Lady said nothing in return.</p>
<p>「Either way, I will be fine in a month. Then I would like to help you, my savior.」</p>
<p>「A month? What can I do?」</p>
<p>「It’s fine. I would choose to stay rotting, even if there is a way to prolong my life. That is my wish」</p>
<p>「I see...」</p>
<p>She must have felt a strong will that could not be overturned by the Silver Lady’s words. Fran could only mutter with an indescribable face.</p>
<p>「...Thank you very much. Is there anything I can do for you? Please let me know in advance. Or do you have anything you would like to know? For example, are you interested in information about the Divine Sword?」</p>
<p>「A divine sword? You know more about the divine sword?」</p>
<p>「We have observed the ten most frequently used crystals on this continent over the past few thousand years, Alpha, Berserk, Charlotte, El Dorado, Gaia, Ignis, Cristaros, Sanctuary, Tempest, and Wisdom, to a certain extent.」</p>
<p>It was not only Alpha and Berserk who came out of his mouth. The names of completely unknown Divine Swords such as Sanctuaries and Wisdom were also coming out of his mouth.</p>
