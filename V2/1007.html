</div><h1>Chapter 1007</h1><p>Fran’s slash cut right into Meritte’s torso. </p>
<p>「Kyaaa!」</p>
<p> A bitter scream leaked out of Meritte’s mouth. Unlike before, he seemed to be feeling a pain. I don’t know much about the divine attribute yet, but I was sure that I had nullified my pain nullification skill. And it wasn’t just pain. The deeply slashed wound was overflowing with magic and evil energy. There was no blood or mana in the wound earlier, but it seemed that the antidemons’ bodies were also badly damaged due to the effects of the divine attribute. There was no blood or mana in the wound earlier, but it seemed that the antidemons’ bodies were also badly damaged due to the effects of the divine attribute.  Moreover, Fran’s attacks did not end there.  </p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>  She slashed back at the tip of her sword, slashing off Meritte’s left arm. Even the antidemon’s body, which boasted a strong defense, could be slashed without pain with the offensive power of the Sword God Transformation. With her overwhelming skill and the dense divine attribute that covered her blade, this blow was truly the work of the Sword God.  </p>
<p>「Suddenly, what...!」</p>
<p>「I won’t let you escape!」</p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>  For the first time, Meritte showed an expression of impatience as Fran suddenly got stronger during the battle. She was trying to escape somehow, but there was no way she could escape from the current Fran.  Fran, on the other hand, looked puzzled to the point that only I could understand. But the same went for me.  </p>
<p>(Are your body light?)</p>
<p>『Yeah.  I feel the same way』</p>
<p> The loss I always felt when I used the Sword God Transformation.  It wasn’t just a reduction in durability.  There was a feeling of wear and tear that worn me out from something deeper. It was less this time.  It wasn’t that there wasn’t much, but it was less than half of the usual. Fran also seemed to feel less backlash. Was it the result of being able to handle the Divine Attributes on her own with the blessings of the Beast and Insect God?  Until now, I had been trying to control the Divine Attributes somehow.  However, it seemed that Fran’s own obtaining the Divine Attributes was a condition for her to use the Sword God Transformation well. Well, she shouldn’t be able to handle it well then. The proof that Fran was able to master this power was not only the lack of backlash and exhaustion. It wasn’t an optimized, auto-battle with Sword God Transformation, but Fran’s body was moving at her will.  Now that she could understand her ideal movement instead of moving on her own, she could choose her own action from among the various options. It was clearly like that.  I think we can cut that thing now. I guess it was the same for Fran.  She suddenly shot a slash at the place I had told her to go. At first glance, it seemed like she had sliced through an empty sky in vain. But that was not the case.  What Fran was aiming for.  It was an invisible string that extended from the cross-shaped magic sword to the antidemons engaged in a fierce battle with Isario.  In the previous clashes, I’ve often overlapped it with the string.  However, that didn’t mean anything would happen to the string. Well, otherwise, we wouldn’t have been able to fight.  But now we could cut it. Both Fran and I were convinced of this.  The result of Fran’s Sword God Transformation and my Evil Domination.  The two were unconsciously combined――  </p>
<p>「It’s broken」</p>
<p>「F-for real...!  Why!?」</p>
<p>  The evil threads were cut off and disappeared.  At the same time, there was a visible change in the movements of the red-golden antidemons. They suddenly slowed down. I would have been lucky if they lost control and killed each other, but things didn’t go as far as expected. Mertritte shouted when she saw the antidemons blown away by Isario.  </p>
<p>「Just a little more!」</p>
<p>  She must have been giving some kind of power to them through the evil threads.  The power that the antidemons were clearly emitting was weakened. They were certainly strong, but not so strong as to be defeated. Meritte, who seemed to be heading towards brute force after seeing the danger of the red-golden antidemons, seemed to not want to be defeated. Apparently, she does not want to defeat that antidemon.  Is this her plan anything to do with it?  </p>
<p>「I can’t go!」</p>
<p>「Giii!」</p>
<p>  Fran attacked Meritte, who was flustered and exposed an opening. She must have remembered that she couldn’t ignore Fran when she was cut down.  Meritte glared at Fran with pure hatred. Fran didn’t stop and continued to attack her.  The fact that she didn’t wear herself out also meant that she could use the Sword God Transformation longer. Fran was still maintaining her Sword God Transformation.  Her arms, legs, and torso were being punctured one after another and regenerated from its edge. Her resistance to the divine attribute was the same as that of Advanced Antidemons.  However, even when her wounds were healed, the magic power she used for regeneration was gradually losing. Obviously, Mertritte’s power was starting to weaken.  And that’s not the only reason why he was forced into the fray.  Mertritte’s movements were slower than before, in contrast to Fran’s extremely strong performance.  It was also probably because he took damage and slowed down. But that’s not all.  He seems to be moving in a strange way for defense.  He can’t help but take our hits at an unnatural moment. It seemed like he was protecting the cross-shaped magic sword.  He was forcibly evading it in a situation where he was trying to take it with his sword at the beginning of the battle. That caused his rhythm to go off and he was even more taking advantage of Fran’s attacks.  If he calmed down and regained his composure, he could still fight, but Meritte was beginning to feel impatient as time went by. Beyond Meritte’s line of sight was the red-golden antidemon that Isario was playing with.  Isario seemed to have regained some composure, and he was clearly receiving more and more counters.  The red-hot body was probably the work of the high-heated field that Isario was good at.</p>
