</div><h1>Chapter 1000</h1><p>While the fierce battle between transcendents was taking place, Fran took a deep breath and concentrated quietly. Movement and stillness. The atmosphere in which they were placed was so different that it was strange that they were in the same space. </p>
<p>「Phew......」</p>
<p>『......』</p>
<p> Not only Fran but I was continuing to work on our power as well. I want to maximize its power when Fran turns to attack. I focus on the Divine Dragon Form and apply the Divine Attribute to my magic power. My blade will be covered with the Divine Attribute, but it’s not enough. My blade will be covered with the Divine Attribute, but that’s not nearly enough. I need more power to inflict a painful blow on that monstrous Dragon King.  Even if I try to unleash my full power, it won’t be enough.  As I focused my attention on my inner self and gathered more strength, I learned many things that I had never known before. I learned that a small amount of Divine Attributes were emitted from the blessings of the Gods within me.  I was also able to feel stronger special skills such as Evil Domination and Metal Form.  I guess it was thanks to the Divine Dragon Form that my senses were sharpened. I also understand Fenrir and Announcer-san, which I didn’t understand until now.  I know that they are now asleep inside me.  I can also see that they are in the process of being severely corrupted and healing their wounds.  And I then dove deeper into myself.  I couldn’t see anything, but I felt as if I was enveloped in darkness. The jet-black darkness clinging to my mind.  I know this darkness.  It was the same territory that sealed the pieces of the Evil God that existed in the depths of my being. I used to be afraid of them, but I’m not afraid of them now. I guess it was because they know that this darkness is not an enemy.  In the center of that darkness, I meet.  Something fearsome, with tremendous power.  Just by being aware of it, a powerful Evil Spirit enveloped me.  It was as if it was covering my mind and stroking me. The evil spirit whispered.  </p>
<p>「Devour all!  Devour everything!  All――」</p>
<p>『Aah, yes yes. Well, that’s fine』</p>
<p>  It was a piece of the Evil God.  Everything that its existence radiated was vile, and even a faint exhalation was dense. I see, I understood why the people of this world described it as evil.  But I had a slightly different impression of it. It was something that made me feel uneasy just by sensing its presence, but I didn’t think it was just evil.  I cut through a sea of evil spirits and aimed for it.  In my ear, a voice called </p>
<p>『CONSUME ALL』</p>
<p> But I ignored it. I’m sure the people in this world were already under the control of the Evil Gods.  But it didn’t work for me.  I was probably because I was from Earth.  And when I thought I had pierced through a large amount of evil spirits, I sensed an even denser evil spirit. It was not just an Evil Spirit.  Maybe it was similar to the Divine Attribute?  It was like an Evil Spirit with the Divine Attribute. But strangely enough, I felt that my Evil Spirit had weakened.  But somehow, it was a small being that emitted that Evil Spirit.  It had a small but tremendous power. However, it was a pitiful existence that was bound and restrained by some kind of power.  After all, I could tell by myself.  </p>
<p>『Uuuu...』</p>
<p>『... Are you a piece of the Evil God?』</p>
<p>『...Uuuu...』</p>
<p>『Oi』</p>
<p>『Uuuu... Uuuu』</p>
<p>  It was no good, huh?  What I am sensing is a lump of Evil Divine Power, tightly held together by a mysterious power. This must be the piece of the Evil God sealed inside me. I called out to him, remembering that I was able to have a conversation with the Goddess of Chaos before, but the pieces of the Evil Gods were all I could do is moan.  Why did I called out to him? Even if it was possible to have a conversation, what were I going to say?  No, I couldn’t help but call out to him. Because the moaning of the Evil God Fragment sounded like the cries of a young girl. Why did this creepy and fearless voice sound like the girl’s...  </p>
<p>『Uuuuh!』</p>
<p>『Shut up!』</p>
<p>  As my consciousness got closer, the moaning became louder. As I thought, the child seemed to be frightened and in tears. </p>
<p>『Hmmm』</p>
<p>『... Uuuh』</p>
<p>  Just don’t get carried away.  Well, it’s okay.  Even if you don’t understand, you can draw out your power. If you use Evil Spirit Control to draw out the Evil God’s power――.  </p>
<p>『No, wait』</p>
<p>  There is no doubt that this was a piece of the Evil God.  If I use it with one-sided control, will it mean I was using the Gods?  Eh?  But I used Evil Spirits before...  Huh? No, the Evil Spirits I felt before were just like a leaking debris.  I-maybe, it’s okay...  right?  However, it’s bad to get power from the Evil God’s pieces, right? But if we can use this Evil God Spirit, we will definitely be able to help Fran...  </p>
<p>「Stop that」</p>
<p>『Who!?』</p>
<p>「Nn?  Master?」</p>
<p>『Huh?  Fran?  Why are you here...?  No, who the other side is?』</p>
<p>  This place should be like my subconscious. I don’t know where it is, but it’s simply that I’m focused inside myself.  Why is Fran inside that consciousness?  It wasn’t an illusion.  It was clearly the real Fran. Besides, there was something huge that gave off a tremendous aura next to it.  It was a ton-demons with a mass of divine energy. At first glance, it looked like a beastman.  Its entire body was covered in fur.  It had a strange look that looked like a wolf, a lion, and a bear combined.  However, its head was covered with long tentacles like a sea lion, and its eyes were double-eyed. And her back had dragonkin-like wings.  </p>
<p>「I came to give blessings to the new qualified. I never thought I’d meet the Messengers of the Goddess of Chaos...」</p>
<p>『You know the Goddess of Chaos?』</p>
<p>  Could it be that he was a lump of divine energy, a mixture of beasts and insects.  Moreover, I knew the Goddess of Chaos.</p>
<p>『Uweeeh!?』</p>
