</div><h1>Chapter 999</h1><p>After healing Velmeria with impotence, Fran and Urushi immediately attacked Tilanaria. Even though she had been enhanced, they did not activate Divine Dragon Form. After inflicting the same amount of damage as Velmeria, they immediately used land magic to block their movements. </p>
<p>「Urushi, keep an eye on the two!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p> With this, the only thing left was Georg the Dragon King. However―― </p>
<p>「Grrrr!」</p>
<p>「Haaaah!」</p>
<p>「Haaaah!」</p>
<p>  The battle between Georg and Isario was too fierce. He had a golden shadow that moved around at super high speeds while using a lot of teleportation, and he was one of the world’s leading adventurers who continued to defend while spreading flames. If we get closer, we could be shattered by the aftermath of Georg’s divine speed, or our bodies could be turned into charcoal by Ignis’ flame heat. There was hell there that we had to prepare for death.  </p>
<p>『Georg’s strength is... too extraordinary』</p>
<p>  It was in a different dimension than Velmeria’s, who was in the same Divine Dragon Form state. Was his original performance a different level? I wouldn’t even be able to find that chance even if I tried to intervene.  But over time, I won’t be able to maintain my Divine Dragon Form.  My durability value was starting to decrease.  Because I’m not a dragonkin, I’m not able to utilize my full strength.  As a result, the backlash was weaker than usual. Even so, I couldn’t maintain that form for a long time.  Thanks to the Divine Dragon Form, the manipulation of the divine attribute has increased tremendously. Now I can unleash a blow with the divine attribute more than ever......  </p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p> Fran was building up her power without the slightest movement. She was just quietly bracing herself as she looked for a lobe to intervene.  </p>
<p>『Robe bastard......』</p>
<p>  She hasn’t moved yet.  Even when Velmeria and Tilanaria were caught, she showed no signs of getting freaked out or trying to save them.  I considered attacking her, but I didn’t want to turn into a mere snake. We’ll have to take Georg down while he’s ignoring us. </p>
<p>『Fran.  How is it?』</p>
<p>(...... Mnh.  A little more.)</p>
<p>  It seems that he’s trying to figure out Georg’s movements. As long as he can get a hit in, he should be able to lose his balance.  Isario would not miss that chance. However, Fran wanted to make this one of the few opportunities perfect.  </p>
<p>(Master.)</p>
<p>『Can you go?』</p>
<p>(Not yet. Can I tell Isario about Master?)</p>
<p>『Hmm? You mean you’re exposing my identity?』</p>
<p>(Nn.  Master tells Isario about your strategy using telepathy)</p>
<p>『Aah, I see』</p>
<p>  Fran seemed to want to concentrate even more. She seemed to be planning to use even the slightest hint of her power to attack.  </p>
<p>(Isario would be fine to tell him about Master)</p>
<p>『... You’re right. Isario might be fine to reveal it』</p>
<p>(Nn)</p>
<p>  A moment’s delay in timing may have fatal results. After all, we should use telepathy to adjust our timing here.  You can hide your identity, but it’s better to tell me clearly and gain trust in me.  That was what Fran thought. Well, I guess she also wanted to avoid having any secrets with Isario, whom she liked.  However, we can’t just surprise her by talking to him out of the blue. I think Isario would be fine, but there would be no chance.  Fran stepped forward a little while without hiding her presence. That’s all that it took for Isario and Georg to get to know Fran better.  Then they raised their voices further.  </p>
<p>「Isario!  You may be surprised now, but don’t be surprised!」</p>
<p>  Wasn’t there another way to say it?  However, I saw Isario nodding lightly in response. It seems that they knew that Fran was trying to intervene. After a short pause, I called out quietly.  </p>
<p>『Isario.  Can you hear me?』</p>
<p>(Woof?  Man?)</p>
<p>『That’s right.  I’m Master.  Well, the ones about the name are in time, so don’t worry about it.  Oh, the answer is good. I’ll speak one-sidedly, so you focus on the battle.』</p>
<p>  Isario seemed to be a little upset, but it didn’t seem to have had a major impact on the battle.  Good grief, I wonder if he was able to do something about it.  </p>
<p>『I’m on your side.  But it’s gonna be hard to believe, so I’ll reveal my identity.  I’m an intelligence weapon. I’m the sword Fran’s equipment』</p>
<p>(Huh?  Oops!)</p>
<p>『I know it’s hard to believe, but I want you to believe me for now』</p>
<p>  Isario glanced at Fran. However, Fran had already started to concentrate and couldn’t afford to react to his gestures.  So, I had no choice but to transform my decorative string into the shape of a hand and return the thumbs up. So, I guess she understood.  </p>
<p>(Seriously?)</p>
<p>『Seriously.  Fran will release one shot now. Please match it up.』</p>
<p>(... Understood.)</p>
<p> All that remains now is for Fran to blow into Georg.  Fran is still focused. Her concentration was so deep and heavy that she couldn’t even feel the presence of her surroundings.  She meditates and completely goes inside of herself.  Don’t you even have to look at Georg now?  But if you shout out now, it might interfere with Fran’s concentration.</p>
<p>(Seriously?)</p>
<p>『Seriously. I’m gonna have Fran take one shot later. Please adjust to that.』</p>
<p>(......Understood.)</p>
<p> All that remains now is for Fran to land a blow on Georg. Fran is still focused. Her concentration was so deep and heavy that she couldn’t even feel the presence of her surroundings. She meditates and completely goes inside of herself. Don’t you even have to look at Georg now? But if you shout out now, it might interfere with Fran’s concentration. All I could do is trust Fran and wait, while protecting her.</p>
