</div><h1>Chapter 1106</h1><p>The conversation ended in a blink of an eye. The soldiers, who were not even trained, immediately made a sound. They were an enemy unit, but they were apparently a group of earth magicians who dug through the border by digging a passageway under the ground. If that was the case, there was a possibility that they would not have noticed. After that, they were planning to attack the enemy town of Kranzel. However, they had left unexpectedly and were in the middle of looking for Alessa. However, they had departed unexpectedly and were in the middle of looking for the town of Alessa.  There were a total of22 people, seven earth magicians, and fifteen guards. However, since four people, including this man, were on scout, there must be currently 11 guards.  Since they didn’t know their combat ability, they would be afraid to attack them out of the blue. But no one knew that they would have to use soldiers of this level as scouts. </p>
<p>『Let’s grab the other three first, who are said to be out for reconnaissance.』</p>
<p>「Okay.」</p>
<p>  We were able to find the scout easily, provided they knew Urushi’s nose and Fran’s senses. It was easy, just by Urushi’s nose and Fran’s senses.  The four of them were probably not specialized scouts, but just magicians and their guards.  The scout soldiers who stole their consciousness were left wrapped in a scout and left behind.  It would be too much trouble to take them with us. Well, if the magic beast doesn’t get them, we’ll come to retrieve them later. We headed to the place we asked the four, and as the information showed, the magic troops of the Kingdom of Raydoss were hiding in the forest.  They didn’t seem to notice even if we approached them through stealth.  This would have been something like this without someone with scouting skills. </p>
<p>『The strongest one is that Earth Magic-user.』</p>
<p>(Nn.  And the soldier beside him.)</p>
<p>『That’s probably their commander.』</p>
<p> The magicians on the whole were of a high level.  They seemed to have a lot of combat experience.  On the other hand, the soldiers were not very strong. They were not weak, but if you ask for adventurers, they would be ranked E.  The soldiers who looked like the captain were reasonably strong, but not Fran’s enemies. Maybe it was better to neutralize the magicians first and then capture the soldiers after that? You can block your way out because you’ll be too lazy to chase after them if they escape.  </p>
<p>『Let’s cover the surroundings with land magic and take them over at once.  Just like when we defeated Hydman. I’ll scatter my thunder magic, so Fran take care of those who look like magicians and soldiers captains』</p>
<p>(Nn)</p>
<p>『Urushi, aim at the magician too. But if there is anyone who escapes somehow, we’ll deal with that one』</p>
<p>(Woof!)</p>
<p>We approached the area while hiding our presence and activated multiple Great Walls to encircle the hiding Raidos troops. The earth wall then surrounded all sides of the troops with roars and smoke.  Fran’s figure was already on the earth wall.  </p>
<p>「W-What’s going on......  I’ll open the escape route for now!」</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Hah!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>  Hey, wasn’t he moving so fast?  I thought he might be even more panicked, but the magicians soon began moving toward the wall. The soldiers seemed to agree with her move.  Before they could check what was going on, they first decided to escape.  They only knew that a wall appeared out of the darkness of the night. Did they sense the mana of that earth magic-type? If there were seven earth magicians and land magicians in one place, they would have holes in the wall in no time at all.  We decided to move in a great hurry before we could escape.  Fran and Urushi had not been found yet. I scattered my thunder magic as I jumped off the wall and slashed at the enemy.  </p>
<p>「Guh!」</p>
<p>「Wha―― Gyaah!」</p>
<p>  Amid the chaos of thunderbolts and roars in the darkness, Fran unexpectedly defeated two enemy commanders. She hadn’t taken their lives, but they were badly injured from the cuts of her arms and legs.  The rest were either paralyzed by thunder magic or restrained by Urushi’s dark magic. So, no one was dead.  </p>
<p>『Alright, let’s get information from the commander for now.  We’ll make sure we’re blood stoppage and separate ourselves from the others. Urushi will keep an eye on us.』</p>
<p>「Urushi, if you want to escape, you can kill them.」</p>
<p>「Grr!」</p>
<p>  I saw magicians trembling at Fran’s words of threat.  They should have been pretty well trained, but Urushi at night was so powerful. Moreover, he was using a fear skill now.  This is a skill that increases the fear he bestows on himself, but he doesn’t use it often.This is a skill that increases the fear you place on yourself, but you don’t use it often.  You can win against someone who is scared of Urushi in the middle of a fight without using any skills, and it won’t be as effective as a match.  Well, it’s a useful way to scare someone at a time like this.  In fact, it worked when we talked about the scout.  And after that, it was the interrogation of land magicians――but he was surprisingly straightforward.  He didn’t seem to be very good at negotiating.  He probably thought that she had to tell the truth in order to save the lives of herself and her comrades. In the first place, they were not interested in this plan itself.  They were not originally under the control of the Southern Duke, who led the invasion. Apparently, they were members of a unit that protected towns from magic beasts and belonged to a place like a support organization for the Red Knights. This was probably why they were not used to negotiating and fighting against humans.  They were forcibly incorporated into their forces and were treated as single-use agents using brute force. Well, they were probably not motivated either.  Their goal was to destroy the walls and the walls of Alessa.  Therefore, there were many earth magicians and earth magicians. Even if they could not collapse the wall in person, they would still create a hole under the ground to collapse it, making it collapse into a wall. That was probably intended to wake up the adventurers who guarded the border and make sure that some of their troops return to Alessa.  They were seriously treating us as shots. </p>
<p>「Since I was a child, the Kranzel Kingdom has been a terrible country, and I’ve been taught that justice comes with the Raidos Kingdom’s control」</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>「But when you live here, you can tell that your country is corrupt.  Especially for people like me who have a lot of contact with their superiors.  Is it for Kranzel’s sake for them to do what they control? Haha, like a pig controlling people, you know?」</p>
<p>The commander muttered and laughed in a self-mocking manner.</p>
