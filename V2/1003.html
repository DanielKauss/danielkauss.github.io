</div><h1>Chapter 1003</h1><p>After her evil energy was canceled out, the girl looked astonished. Her ability to control evil energy was often clothed in powerful evil energy similar to that of fiends and evil dragonkin. She must have been surprised that Fran, who didn’t seem to be able to control evil energy, had manipulated it. But then Isario suddenly began to move. </p>
<p>「I’ll give you more information... Let’s beat them up and try asking them about it!」</p>
<p>「Oh, you’re as barbarous as a dragonkin, aren’t you? You don’t even have a woman, right?」</p>
<p> You don’t even have a woman here, right?」</p>
<p>「You’ve grown up badly too!」</p>
<p>  Isario raises his Ignis.  What surprised me was the girl’s courage to stand in front of the pressure and talk lightly. She didn’t even seem to be in a hurry.  Isario attacked the thin-smiled girl with flames.  It looked as if the flames of the red lotus had swallowed her little body―― but just before, the flames had been blocked so that it could not be seen against the wall. Even though she was holding back quite a bit, it was Ignis’ flames, you know?  </p>
<p>「Tsk!  Just focus on your attack! Young lady!」</p>
<p>「Nn! Urushi!」</p>
<p>「Hon!」</p>
<p>  It seemed that she understood from her attack and defense that the girl in the robe was no ordinary opponent. Isario stood in between the girls to help Fran and Urushi escape.  He must have thought that she was at a disadvantage in the presence of anyone in her way.  Fran carried Velmeria and Tilanaria on her shoulders, and Urushi aimed for the entrance with Frederick’s collar in his mouth. However, neither Fran nor Urushi could leave the room. </p>
<p>「Muguh?」</p>
<p>「Uwaah!」</p>
<p>『What the hell is this?』</p>
<p>「Hon?」</p>
<p>  There was an invisible wall at the entrance.  Fran and Velmeria, who had struck their foreheads, frowned. It’s probably the same wall that blocked Isario’s flames earlier.  It might be similar to Seliadot’s wards.  It’s harder to detect, but still much stronger. Fran didn’t frighten when she hit the front kick. Fran backed up and held her stance again. </p>
<p>「Let’s get serious!」</p>
<p>『Should we use the divine attribute?』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  She still couldn’t perfect her divine attribute in an instant.  But she seemed to be able to handle it on her own volition.  </p>
<p>「Hmm.」</p>
<p>『What’s wrong!』</p>
<p>「It looks like it’ll work better than before.」</p>
<p>  Maybe it was thanks to the blessing of the Beast Bug God.  After a few seconds of pause, I saw a faint divine attribute dwell in Fran’s legs.  </p>
<p>「Phew......! Hah!」</p>
<p>  This time, the barrier was easily shattered. Rather than being powerful, the divine attribute seemed to have been more effective.  </p>
<p>「That’s crazy!  I’ve heard that it can withstand a single blow of extreme magic!」</p>
<p>『Fran, Urushi! Let’s go!』</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Wait!」</p>
<p>「Lov girl. Isario attacked and interfered with the mysterious chase of the robe girl. Unlike before, it was a serious fire with the divine attribute infused into it.  </p>
<p>「You’re breaking the barrier again?  I’m getting tired of it!」</p>
<p>  The girl let out an irritated voice, but she didn’t hear a scream.  Was she safe from taking Isario’s flames?  No, her robe and a part of her skin were burned. Besides, her appraisal finally showed a slight difference.  I guess that robe must have had a powerful concealment effect. Her name was Merritte Wisteria, and that was Wisteria. It was Wisteria, one of the three Gordician families along with Camellia and Magnolia, and also the most dangerous place, according to Tzaluta.  I understood why she hated dragonkin. After all, the dragonkin destroyed him and took away the pieces of the Evil God.  Moreover, his race was a lorelei.  They were originally from human, right? But that’s one of the reasons why they resented us.  Now that we know where that barrier came from, I’m pretty sure Seliadot was. I’m pretty sure Seliadot was.  I don’t know where she is, but it wouldn’t be surprising if the lorelei were working together.  The only problem was how much they were involved.  She mentioned Seliadot was trying to chase after the slavers’ organizations. I remember her culprit being told that she was Georg.  But Mertritte must have been working with Georg.  No, wasn’t she just working with her because she had only manipulated him in some way? Anyways, it would be quite troublesome if Seliadot were to become a mere enemy.  Also curious was Merutte’s “Guide to Evil Spirits”.  That was the special skill of the three Gordician families. Apparently, he had the power to make fiends go completely berserk, but is that what allowed Georg to control them?  </p>
<p>「Wait!  Only the dragonkin won’t let them escape!」</p>
<p>「You’re gonna take me down then.」</p>
<p>「Tch!」</p>
<p>  Fran and the others ran through a narrow passageway, feeling the battle starting behind them.  Trismegistus came back to the huge underground hall where he had shown them his power.  Come to think of it, Trismegistus? I’ve only been keeping quiet for a while......  </p>
<p>「Velmeria, can you move?」</p>
<p>「Yeah...」</p>
<p>「What about Frederick?」</p>
<p>「I’m fine.」</p>
<p>  Frederick, who looked like he was about to be manipulated earlier, is apparently fine right now. Should we get some more distance from here?  </p>
<p>「I’ll move. Please hold back a little longer.」</p>
<p>  Fran and Urushi picked up Velmeria and Frederick again and began to move.  And just a short distance from the door leading to the nuclear facility.  Clang!  </p>
<p>『Uwaah! What the hell!』</p>
<p>「!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p> A tremendous explosion echoed through the air.</p>
<p>「We’ll be fine.」</p>
<p> Frederick, who looked like he was about to be controlled earlier, now seems to be fine. Should we get some further away from here? </p>
<p>「Let’s move. Please hold on a little longer.」</p>
<p> Fran and Urushi picked up Velmeria and Frederick again and began to move. And just a short distance away from the door leading to the nuclear facility. Clang! </p>
<p>『Uwah! What!』</p>
<p>「!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p> A tremendous explosion echoed through the air. We hurriedly turned around, and saw the door to the passageway between the nuclear facilities blown away and flames overflowed with tremendous force from the passageway.</p>
