</div><h1>Chapter 1024</h1><p>The ability of the necronomicon that Jayne released was not limited to summoning heroic spirits from past Divine Sword users.</p>
<p>Fran’s continued the offensive, but not with her sword.</p>
<p>Jayne summoned more than a hundred high ghosts. Each of them was a higher species that could handle magic, and had physical permeability that could not be defeated by physical attacks. Under Jayne’s command, they even handled ritual magic.</p>
<p>These vicious undead were buffed by Necronomicon and Sophie’s magical songs. Each one of them seemed to be at least Threat Level B.</p>
<p>Sophie didn’t have time to hide anymore, or rather, she released her oratorium normally. Now that Isario and Zefmate appeared on the stage, they must have understood that this was a battle that needed to be fought. Mea, Hilt, Zefmate, and Colbert guarded Sophie as well. They seemed to have managed to withstand that tremendous fall.</p>
<p>I thought he was not dead, but it turns out he’s still fine.</p>
<p>Isario’s flames and Jayne’s High Ghost, as well as the attacks of Mea, the soldiers, and the adventurers with Sophie’s support, bit by bit shattered the body of the giant antidemons. With the cooperation of the three divine swords, it even exceeded the regenerative power of the antidemons without being able to unleash a move.</p>
<p>The particularly vicious one would be the flames controlled by Isario. He had turned the body of an antidemon into ashes little by little, due to his pure offensive power.</p>
<p>But I didn’t think Isario was in perfect condition.</p>
<p>(Isario. He’s leveling down?)</p>
<p>『Yeah. His movements are obviously slowing down.』</p>
<p>Isario had been using his Divine Sword for a long time, and his level had dropped considerably. If he hadn’t gone any further, his life would surely be in danger.</p>
<p>Jayne was also worried.</p>
<p>「Ahahaha! I’ll crush you with all my might!」</p>
<p>At first glance, she looked excited and energetic, but her complexion was pale. Originally, she had skin that looked pale, but now it could be said that she was pale.</p>
<p>「Jayne, are you okay?」</p>
<p>「I’m a little more cautious! But they’re harder than I thought, and I can give you a little blunder?」</p>
<p>Huh? Was it huge? Either way, it seems that the giant antidemons are harder than expected.</p>
<p>Jayne put it bluntly, but the backlash on a Divine Sword must be fairly high.</p>
<p>「Like I thought, I’ll―」</p>
<p>「Well well, wait a minute. You said that earlier, right? We told you to leave it to us adults. If you continued to sacrifice children in succession, the name of the Demon Lord would be ruined」</p>
<p>Jayne stopped the hydrangea that tried to hold Berserk up again.</p>
<p>「Keep watching. The secret technique of our national treasure, the necronomicon! Well, it’ll take a while though」</p>
<p>She seems to have some kind of secret technique, like Adoll’s “Evil God Slayer”. The divine power emitted by the necronomicon gradually increased in intensity.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to let the hydrangea die, but Fran would be sad if Jayne died. I didn’t want her to be reckless, but that was not what I wanted.</p>
<p>Thanks to the supply of magic power from the Abyss Eater, the regeneration rate seemed to have increased dramatically compared to the beginning.</p>
<p>Obviously, he had become much stronger. Even though his body was crushed, I could feel that only his magic power increased. Once he retreated and came back, he seemed to have become so strong that he could not touch it.</p>
<p>「We’re coming too.」</p>
<p>『Yeah』</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>Just as Fran and I rushed out with determination, a scream leaked out of her mouth. It wasn’t that we were attacked either.</p>
<p>「Isario!」</p>
<p>It was Isario who had been attacked. It seems that the giant antidemons had been gathering power while pretending to not be resisting it. This was probably also to deliver a thrust to eliminate Isario, who was the most troublesome of the bunch.</p>
<p>I could see a magic bullet released from one of the giant antidemons’ eyes, smashing through Isario’s defenses and blasting them away.</p>
<p>Sensing that pursuit was about to be delivered to Isario, who was lying on the ground, Fran jumped out at once. Before she could kick the ground, she transformed herself into black lightning and jumped out between the antidemons and Isario.</p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>『Fran! Yeah! Shit!』</p>
<p>That attack was enough to knock away that Isario!</p>
<p>It easily pierced through my barrier, and Fran and I were flicked away. With just one blow, my sword blade was cracked. Fran also had broken both of her arms and was taking a lot of damage.</p>
<p>Still, they couldn’t afford to stop.</p>
<p>『Fran! The next one is coming!』</p>
<p>「Nn......!」</p>
<p>While I was healing her, Fran landed on the ground and ran forward. She held him as if to kidnap Isario without killing his momentum, twisting herself and dodging any magic bullets. Her cat’s ears were cut off by the magic bullets she caught, and her blood flew.</p>
<p>The magic bullets released one after another to Fran, who was running with Isario in her arms. I guess she has no intention of letting Isario escape.</p>
<p>『Isario! Isario!』</p>
<p>「......Sorry! Thank you for all your help! I got a little behind in my movements when I gathered up enough strength to unleash a big one......」</p>
<p>She seems to be fine. Apparently, her defenses were slightly neglected due to her accumulation of magic power. I could see that a large amount of magic power was still maintained in Isario.</p>
<p>The barrage of bullets got thicker as if it was trying to stop us.</p>
<p>Now that Isario’s flames had stopped, he was able to divert the power and mana he had been diverting to regeneration to attack more of them.</p>
<p>「Fran, throw me away! You’re good!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Isario, away from Fran’s hand, rolled on the ground to kill his momentum and ran off in the opposite direction from Fran.</p>
<p>She must have tried to keep her distance from Fran so that she could not be attacked any further.</p>
<p>But by rescuing Isario, Fran had also been targeted by the antidemons. And at the same time, a magic bullet was launched at us too. No, considering the time it took for Isario and Jayne’s trump card to be activated, is that all right? But their attacks were way too fierce!</p>
<p>Fran avoided a direct hit at the very edge, but it would be dangerous at this rate. Both Fran and I had been exhausted in the fierce battles so far. The sharpness of our movements had dropped considerably.</p>
<p>Still, Fran saw through the magic bullets, dodging them with a sleigh, and slashing at them with me.</p>
<p>However, the compressed magic bullets released by the antidemons were much more powerful than we had expected. After defending against several magic bullets, my blade snapped in half.</p>
<p>「Master!」</p>
<p>『I’m fine! But more importantly, don’t dodge it!』</p>
<p>「Kuh!」</p>
<p>『Fran! You’re so reckless!』</p>
<p>「Kuh...... I’m... fine.」</p>
<p>He hesitated to use it because I was afraid it would get even worse. He forced his arms to deflect the magic projectile, which flew off from Fran’s right elbow.</p>
<p>I activated all my healing magic while holding it in my torn hand and flying through the air. Both Fran and I quickly closed up our wounds with instant regeneration. However, the damage caused by the Great Magic Beast had made Fran’s legs tangled lightly and she had missed the chance to escape.</p>
<p>『Uwooooh!』</p>
<p>I slipped in to become Fran’s shield. I wonder how much of a barrier I could withstand it.</p>
<p>I could see Fran’s face contorted in sorrow. But the worst future Fran had imagined did not come to her.</p>
<p>There was more figure between Fran and me. She managed to block the magic bullet by putting up a barrier. Her arms seemed to have been damaged, but blood did not flow out of her arms.</p>
<p>On the contrary, she didn’t seem to feel any pain. Well, that was not surprising. After all, she was a golem.</p>
<p>「I’m going to jump.」</p>
<p>The silver-haired woman jumped at once with Fran in her arms. She glided through the air using magic release.</p>
<p>「Why are you here?」</p>
<p>「As for Nadia-sama, I’ve left it to Mulsani, the merchant. And I’m here to make the most of my life」</p>
<p>The answer was a human-looking golem, created by the divine blacksmith Zechs. She was a silver woman.</p>
