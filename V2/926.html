</div><h1>Chapter 926</h1><p>Almost at the same time as Urushi’s victory, the battle among his companions ended. A pillar of white flames radiated from Mea, enough to pierce the sky. Those attacks devoured the four-armed knight-type. I guess the reason why we were so close to him was because we didn’t sense any heat coming from him. Velmeria was fighting a huge knight-type about five meters long. However, she was defeated in a head-on collision with Velmeria and was crushed by a fist clad in water. However, she was defeated in a head-on collision with Velmeria and was crushed by a fist covered with water. Zefmate, who was struggling the most, managed to defeat the knight-type, which had about twice as long arms and legs, with a series of attacks.  Compared to Fran and the others, she had taken a lot of damage. It was not so much the difference between the Holy Beast and the Divine Beast, but the difference in their original abilities.  If Royce and Goddarfa, who were companions of the Beast King, had become a Holy Beast, it would not be surprising if they could fight on par with Fran now.  </p>
<p>「Zefmate, nice one!」</p>
<p>「Thank you very much, young miss!」</p>
<p>  It seems that the master and servant here are doing fine as well. Zefmate smiled as Mea praised them.  All of them defeated their commanders and performed their roles properly. As a result, there was something wrong with the antidemon horde.  It was the same as when we were at Castel.  They had lost their leader and began to move independently.  It seemed that there were several commanders in this horde. They must have been on this big of a group when several of them joined up.  </p>
<p>「They’re coming!」</p>
<p>  The antidemons around us rushed towards us at once. At this rate, they might use an avalanche to push toward Sendia.  But Fran and the others were not worried. In front of Sendia, the giant dragon-shaped Lindwilm was sitting.  </p>
<p>「Grooooooooogh!」</p>
<p>  The shockwave of its roar defeated the antidemons, and the flames coming from its mouth turned the antidemons into charcoal. If he cleaves the antidemons with his tail, a large number of antidemons will disappear, and the winds of his wings will hold back the antidemon’s army.  This was truly an unbreakable fortification. No one antidemon could break through their defenses. However, we don’t know how long the strengthening from Oracle would last. </p>
<p>「We will destroy the rest of the antidemons as soon as possible!」</p>
<p> Well, in Fran’s case, her focus would be on me and Urushi’s magic though. I scattered my Thunderbolt Magic and Fire Magic while manipulating the Steel Wolf to defeat the antidemons. Urushi’s dark magic in his enhanced state also extended quite a range, probably far beyond that of human magicians. In the distance, the white flames quietly raged wildly, and I could see that water magic was swallowing the antidemons like a creature.  Was the shadow flying on the side of the white flame Zefmate? Be careful with the friendly fire, okay?  Even though I know that Mea’s flame control was perfect now, I have an image of her as a former outburst girl. A little mistake like that would go against Zefmate, and Mea would be able to do it.I was a little nervous watching over Zefmate, but he was also moving faster and more tricky.  Thanks to the fact that he was using his leopard legs all over his body with the blue leopard skill, he was able to knock in the air with his hands, elbows, and sometimes tail, and turn and jump at unexpected times.  In the end, nothing happened until the very end. Well, there was one suspicious scene, but Zefmate had definitely avoided it.  So, I guess Mea was the one who buried the enemy the most?  Velmeria would have the next point.  </p>
<p>「I’ve almost defeated them!」</p>
<p>「I’ve defeated all the antidemons in this area. So, it’s no longer a problem.」</p>
<p>  Mea and Velmeria gave a light high touch.  Before we knew it, they seemed to be getting along, as well.  </p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p> For the time being, the crisis was over.  </p>
<p>「We’ve won.」</p>
<p>「Indeed! That’s right!」</p>
<p>  While everyone was happy in this way, the song of the adventurer that had echoed on the battlefield suddenly stopped. At the same time, the golden magic that had surrounded Fran and Urushi also lost its shine.  </p>
<p>「Hmm?  Power...」</p>
<p>『Oi, this is not the place!  Let’s go back to the town before we leave!』</p>
<p>「Nn. Let’s go to the town」</p>

<p>「Nn.  Let’s go to the town」</p>
<p>「Yeah!  Yes, you’re right!  Let’s run!」</p>
<p>  I didn’t know how many side effects or backlashes would appear, but they were all surprisingly strong. The backlash from using those techniques must have been heavy no matter how I looked at it.  They all hurried to Sophie and the others, using the remaining power.  Well, it would have been only a few seconds in their current condition though.  I could see why the song stopped as we approached the town. It wasn’t only Sophie, the others were sitting down with exhaustion. They must have been doing their best too.  But when they saw Fran and her party, they all stood up and waved their hands. They were greeted with claps and cheers.  </p>
<p>「Thanks!」</p>
<p>「Thanks!」</p>
<p>「Got it!」</p>
<p>  Everyone smiled.  They were overcome with joy from the bottom of their hearts, as well as a sense of gratitude towards Fran and Sophie. Fran must have understood that too.  When she saw those civilians, Fran muttered. </p>
<p>「That’s great!」</p>
<p>『Yeah, it’s great!』</p>
<p>  I could understand what Fran wanted to say without saying anything.But when they saw Fran and Charon, they all stood up and waved their hands. They were greeted with claps and cheers. </p>
<p>「Thanks―!」</p>
<p>「Thanks!」</p>
<p>「Thanks!」</p>
<p>「That was great!」</p>
<p> Everyone smiled. They were overcome with joy from the bottom of their hearts, showing that they were grateful to Fran and Charon. Fran must have understood what they were saying. When she saw those civilians, Fran muttered. </p>
<p>「That’s great!」</p>
<p>『Yeah, it’s great!』</p>
<p> I could understand what Fran wanted to say without saying anything. I felt the same way too.</p>
