</div><h1>Chapter 927</h1><p>The civilians were applauding Fran and the others for their thunderbolt magic, but they also looked pretty exhausted. Many of them were too tired to even endure it and were sitting down.</p>
<p>Some of them were injured too. It seems the cause was not only the battle.</p>
<p>She must have been injured when she rescued soldiers and adventurers from the rubble of the walls destroyed by the cannon-type.</p>
<p>Other than that, some of them seemed to have felt so pained in their throats because they had gone all out to sing.</p>
<p>Among these people, Sophie was in particularly bad condition.</p>
<p>Her fingers, which were playing the harp, were covered with blood and her claws were peeling off. It must have been quite a burden for her.</p>
<p>She had lost her blood and almost no magic power from her face. She had used up all her strength. That was exactly how she was.</p>
<p>But Sophie greeted us with a tired face and a smile.</p>
<p>「Guys. Thank you for saving Sendia.」</p>
<p>「Thanks to Sophie and my friends. I’m the one who’s paying my respects.」</p>
<p>「That’s right! I’d love to have a party with you, but... I feel a little drowsy...」</p>
<p>「Me too...」</p>
<p>Fran, Mea, and Velmeria were about to collapse at any moment. They were too worn out to control their drowsiness.</p>
<p>「Woooof!?」</p>
<p>『Rhyndo! Thank you very much!』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Lind, whose figure had begun to disappear, seemed to have just barely heard a telepathy. He then let out a scream and disappeared.</p>
<p>「Miss Hilt, are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Are you okay?」</p>
<p>「It’s not enough to sleep here」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Urushi, sleepy」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>Zefmate and Urushi didn’t seem to be falling asleep at all. Well, I guess there are differences in individuals after all.</p>
<p>「Unyu...」</p>
<p>「W-woof!」</p>
<p>Race: Ragnarok Wolf; Demon Wolf; Magic Beast</p>
<p>「Let’s take him into the building somewhere.」</p>
<p>「Y-Yes sir!」</p>
<p>「Fran, do your best a little harder」</p>
<p>「Yeah.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Milady」</p>
<p>「H-Hmm...」</p>
<p>「Lady dragonkin too, come here.」</p>
<p>Zefmate, while lending Mea a hand, managed to pull Velmeria’s hand. We can leave that one to him.</p>
<p>Sophie led Fran and Urushi to a private house nearby. Apparently, it was the house of someone who had participated in the volunteer work. I guess they usually used it as a warehouse.</p>
<p>I laid out the futon on the floor under the guild of the wind that Fran had taken out of the dimensional storage. I guess we can just take out five of them for now?</p>
<p>Then Urushi and Zefmate put the girls on the ground.</p>
<p>『Good day off, Fran』</p>
<p>「Nn......Shut up.」</p>
<p>Maybe it was only at their limit. Fran nodded lightly and fell into a dream world. Mea and Velmeria had already fallen asleep too.</p>
<p>『Urushi, how is it?』</p>
<p>「......Ofa~」</p>
<p>Urushi and Zefmate looked sleepy too. But if they fell asleep right here, they would be worried about Fran and Zefmate’s safety.</p>
<p>Or rather, what about my backlash?</p>
<p>Evil Spirits had already been completely suppressed. It looked like he could still use the skill, but...</p>
<p>『Fenrir? Announcer-san?』</p>
<p>『Master, are you done?』</p>
<p>《Attenuated evil energy detected. Battle expected to end.》</p>
<p>『Can’t you see it?』</p>
<p>Normally, Fenrir and Announcer-san would have been able to see the outside from within me. In fact, it seemed that both of them knew much about my actions.</p>
<p>《In order to stop the outburst of activation, all abilities were used to control it. During that time, all information about the outside world was blocked》</p>
<p>I knew it was powerful, but to think it was a failed divine sword!</p>
<p>『Yeah, the antidemons have been exterminated. So, what will happen to me after this? Because of the backlash, I’m worried about Fran’s defenses if she’s going to sleep longer』</p>
<p>So far, there was no sign of any recoil. I felt less worn out, just like when I used Potential Release.</p>
<p>『It’s reassuring. We’ll split up and take care of the backlash on Master and Fran』</p>
<p>《Yes. Both are expected to require only minor wear and tear》</p>
<p>『Eh? Does Fenrir and the others have to bear the price for me and Fran? Are they going to be okay?』</p>
<p>『We might not be able to make contact with Master for a while again, but that’s all. Don’t worry, it won’t be over before it disappears』</p>
<p>『When he asked me to be relieved by that... Besides, he even said that he was going to take on the backlash of Fran... But is that what he could do?』</p>
<p>『I’m glad that the Divine Beast showed up in Fran. He’s a former Divine Beast you know? As long as there’s only a slight connection, I can handle this』</p>
<p>It seemed that because she was a former Divine Beast, she could interfere with the Divine Beast’s transformation. Fenrir would take on Fran’s wear and tear and the cost of doing so, and she would also share it with Announcer-san.</p>
<p>《This is a measure for the safety of the individual named Fran, the wielder. If the individual named Master, the main personality, falls asleep, the safety of the individual named Fran will be impeded》</p>
<p>『That’s exactly what I mean. One of our strengths is being able to work together at a time like this, right?』</p>
<p>『...It really doesn’t mean that Fenrir and Announcer-san will disappear, right?』</p>
<p>《Yes. They will go dormant for a certain period of time, but they can return in a short period of time》</p>
<p>『Well, I think it’s at least a few weeks, right?』</p>
<p>『I see...』</p>
<p>Certainly, considering Fran’s concerns, I am grateful that I was able to keep up. We should rely on Announcer-san and the others for now.</p>
<p>『I’m always sorry. I just rely on Announcer-san and Urushi.』</p>
<p>《Negative. And here to thank you.》</p>
<p>『As Announcer-san said, I’m able to do a rewarding job even for a person like us who had been waiting for us to disappear. I wonder if I appreciate it』</p>
<p>《Yes. As the individual named Fenrir said, thank you very much.》</p>
<p>『This doesn’t mean that Announcer-san and I will lose my authority. Well, just think that we’re on a vacation for a while』</p>
<p>Fenrir’s ability to absorb magic stones. Translation and Announcer-san was assisting with these. It seemed that I could use them as before.</p>
<p>『Okay. And there’s one more thing I’m wondering about. May I ask you?』</p>
<p>『I think I’ll be able to talk in a little while, you know?』</p>
<p>『What was that thing about the King Wolf Sword, Fenrir?』</p>
