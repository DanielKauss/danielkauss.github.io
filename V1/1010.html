</div><h1>Chapter 1010</h1><p>It was barbaricly rugged. But it wasn’t necessarily barbaric.</p>
<p>Fran’s current movements were both angry and calm.</p>
<p>Maybe her killing intent was sharpening her wild intuition. She must have subconsciously understood that in order to kill someone, she couldn’t just go on a rampage while feeling angry.</p>
<p>The Sword God Transformation had already been canceled, but its movement was getting sharper and sharper. Moreover, it was becoming fierce.</p>
<p>Fran moved around Trismegistus in an uproar.</p>
<p>I used aerial hop, wind magic, fire magic, pillars created by earth magic, and magic threads stretched out between them to fly and bounce.</p>
<p>His movements were ridiculously tricky and fast, just like a ball of pinballs we had repelled with all our might.</p>
<p>It seems that he has come here and is beginning to master Sword King Technique with instinct.</p>
<p>His experience with the Sword God Transformation, which was ahead of him, must have affected his Sword King Skill. It is strange that he is changing to a more skilled fighting style that uses a lot of high-speed maneuvering instead of leaning toward a simple fighting style like the Sword God Transformation...</p>
<p>Because she understood how far the top was, she seemed to be able to perfect her Sword King Skill, which took advantage of her current strengths.</p>
<p>However, even so, we could not break through Trismegistus’ defenses.</p>
<p>This man, too, was a wielder of the Sword King Technique and had extensive combat experience.</p>
<p>In contrast to Fran, who was showing a lightning-like attack with divine speed three-dimensional mobility, he had a huge mountain-like presence that could not move from the spot and turn around with wide field of view and insight.</p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>「Hmm」</p>
<p>Lightning Stone Fire and Calm Judgment. If Fran was the Sword King of Movement, then Trismegistus was the Sword King of Silence. Even though they were the same skill, I didn’t think they were this different in type of battle.</p>
<p>I guess it meant that the destination was different depending on the qualities and experience of each individual.</p>
<p>Besides, there were other things that were bothering me besides my surroundings. It was the eyes of Trismegistus. I had those deep eyes that seemed to see through everything, as I thought when I noticed Urushi hiding in the shadows.</p>
<p>Those were not the eyes of many people. They made me wonder if they could see further into the depths of her being.</p>
<p>I’ve been watching us with those strange eyes for a long time now. I felt as if everything other than Fran’s movements had been seen through.</p>
<p>「Colos!」</p>
<p>「Just try it」</p>
<p>「Raaaaah!」</p>
<p>The exchanges only got more intense.</p>
<p>They were engaged in a battle where their intentions were mixed, and there was a mixture of fact and fiction. It was a very dense exchange of sword kings, even though it was only for a short time.</p>
<p>Even to my eyes, they looked almost equal. Compared to Trismegistus and Fran, they probably lost in many aspects. However, only the skill of their sword allowed them to fight on the same arena.</p>
<p>However, if their swordsmanship were the same, Trismegistus, who was immortal, would have an overwhelming advantage. They could demonstrate their full strength without worrying about exhaustion or recoil.</p>
<p>Fran, on the other hand, was not able to do without the blessing of the Beast Bug God, even though the backlash of the Divine Attribute had been reduced.</p>
<p>If he was even more motivated, they would lose their footing at once. The longer this battle dragged on, the more of a disadvantage we would be in.</p>
<p>Still, I didn’t immediately stop her because it might have been possible for me to get a hit on her.</p>
<p>He apparently would be resurrected between the thrones if he died. He would certainly be licking us, and at the very least, he would be immortal, giving us a good chance of being exploited.</p>
<p>Trismegistus muttered something in the midst of the fierce battle.</p>
<p>「......I see. Let’s try it. Okay.」</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>『Fran! Juanaverta, you’re going to do something!』</p>
<p>It suddenly looked like he was talking to himself, but I guess Juanaverta was giving him instructions. Immediately after my warning, Trismegistus’ eyes turned to us.</p>
<p>I don’t see anything unusual with the sword――</p>
<p>「Patience. 『The source of jealousy.』</p>
<p>「Eh?」</p>
<p>『Fran! Shit!』</p>
<p>What happened? The activation was so fast that she couldn’t even evade it! For a moment, the countless tentacle-like magic power emanating from them appeared to have enveloped Fran, and suddenly her movement slowed down.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Trismegistus’ movements were accelerating.</p>
<p>I was bewildered by the huge difference in speed that was born in an instant, and Fran’s face was sliced open with Juanaverta’s blade.</p>
<p>If I hadn’t quickly defeated it with telekinesis and wind magic, my head might have been cut off.</p>
<p>But I didn’t make it completely in time, and I cut deeply from his right jaw to his ear. He healed with recovery magic, but also accelerated with flame magic and left at once. Fran’s back, which was dragging her on the ground, was shredded and blood was gushing out, but it’s better than dead!</p>
<p>「Young miss!」</p>
<p>Isario, who had just blasted away the antidemons, could be seen running toward us. It must have looked as if Fran had been seriously injured.</p>
<p>「You okay?」</p>
<p>「Nn, I’m fine」</p>
<p>Fran stood up, wiping the blood off her face. Well, it doesn’t do as much damage as it looks, but I’m still worried that she’ll cut her face.</p>
<p>『Fran, what happened?』</p>
<p>(Suddenly, my body became heavy. All the various enhancements have disappeared.)</p>
<p>『I see. So, it’s the ability to forcibly cancel enhancements! No, seeing the change in Trismegistus, it might be a skill that takes away an opponent’s enhancement』</p>
<p>(But......)</p>
<p>『But, what’s wrong?』</p>
<p>(Magic power recovered.)</p>
<p>『Huh?』</p>
<p>Now that you mention it, Fran’s mana had almost fully recovered. So, in other words, she had regained her mana instead of being deprived of the strengthening effect?</p>
<p>I didn’t get it.</p>
<p>However, Fran seemed to have calmed down a little now that she had been hit by an unknown ability. Her killing intent was considerably suppressed.</p>
<p>「......What have you done?」</p>
<p>「Hmm. I’ll let you know if Isario is willing to let you know anyway. The name of the power used was 『The source of jealousy』, which is the ability to forcibly exchange equivalent power with the subject. What you just used was to take some of her power and force her to use magic power.」</p>
<p>「It’s still a ridiculous ability as usual. The only salvation is that I can’t use it continuously」</p>
<p>I see, so it’s not a matter of stealing, but a kind of exchange! But unlike our skill taker, it seems that it can forcibly exchange magic power, buffs under enhancement, and many other things.</p>
<p>「With this power, you can take away the skills and such that the girl has. What about you holding that sword before you lose something important?」</p>
<p>「......There’s nothing more important than this sword!」</p>
<p>『......Ah, that disgusting little girl! I’m jealous of those eyes full of life force...』</p>
<p>Suddenly, a woman’s screeching voice rang out in our minds. Just by looking at her voice, I could fully understand the malice directed at us.</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>『Is this Juanaverta?』</p>
