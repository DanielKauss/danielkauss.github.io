</div><h1>Chapter 953</h1><p>「Miss Hilt... Why don’t you take a break now?」</p>
<p>「Nn? Oh, I’m fine. The uncle doesn’t have much strength, so I’m already tired.」</p>
<p>「Okay.」</p>
<p> Half a day after we left Brutori early in the morning for an investigation request, we were on our way to the center of the continent. There was the castle of Trismegistus and the place where the main source of the antidemons, the Abyss Eater, rested. We actually obtained information about Trismegistus and his beloved sword from the Silver Lady along with the information about the Divine Sword. We didn’t know who he was, but we did know a lot about his whereabouts and abilities. We didn’t know who she was, but we did know where she was and what she was capable of. There was a small castle in the center of the continent, and Trismegistus was sleeping there.  Well, our destination was a little in front of it though.  We were to check the number of antidemons in the center to see if there were any abnormalities. Isario said he was tired, but I guess he was concerned for Fran, who hadn’t been eating since our departure this morning.  Fran landed on Urushi and immediately started preparing her meal.  In the middle of the wilderness with a nice view, she used earth magic to create a chair and a table.  Thanks to the improved skills in earth magic, it was a beautiful table with no distortion at all. I put a white cloth on it and finished the table.  Well, I told her so by telepathy.  Fran doesn’t mind just being like that, but I really want her to eat even a little better. She also has a chair for Isario, right? </p>
<p>「I-I’m particular about the details」</p>
<p>「Master’s insistence」</p>
<p>「Hmm?  So, you’ve taught me that?  I think it’s a good teacher」</p>
<p>  Isario nodded in admiration and sat down in the chair in front of him. He seemed to be really impressed because he knew the importance of eating.  What I took out was a stew and a carapace.  Fran must have wanted to eat the curry, but she ate it this morning as well. I had considered the nutritional balance and made it different.  </p>
<p>「Nom nom!」</p>
<p>「Om om!」</p>
<p>  Fran and Urushi began to devour the super-sized carapace. I’d like to wipe the stew on their mouths, but it’s right in front of Isario.  They say hunger is the best spice, but Fran and Urushi are the same at all times. A mountain of lizards quickly disappeared.  Isario glanced at us. I couldn’t hide my envious expression, but he didn’t say he wanted it.  Even this bad guy must have known that eating a meal for a child was too much for him.  He then began to eat the sandwich of spiciness and ham.  I think it was a good meal for an adventurer, but it seemed to be unappetizing for someone in front of Fran. He looked a little subtle.  Fran then glanced at Isario like that. Then she gently lifted up three more dishes with carapaces remaining and placed them in front of Isario.  </p>
<p>「I’ll give it to you」</p>
<p>「... Are you sure?」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>「Thanks!」</p>
<p>  She didn’t have to tell her that she wanted it, but she would accept it if she was asked to. So much so that she was eager to return it, she picked up a dish of dragonkin.  </p>
<p>「T-This is!」</p>
<p>「Is it good?」</p>
<p>「Ou!  Yum!  It’s so damn good!That’s good to hear.  Apparently, he didn’t bring a drink with him. This bad dad looks like he’ll drink normally.  Just as that thought passed through my mind, Fran pulled out a few bottles of wine. It turned out to be liquor.  </p>
<p>『Wha, Fran?  Where did you get it!?』</p>
<p>(This is the guild’s bar.  I put in the leftovers.)</p>
<p>  Fran was strangely interested in liquor. It seemed that she had stored the liquor that had been left unattended on the day of the party in her storage.  </p>
<p>「Eh? Young lady?」</p>
<p>「I’ll give it to you」</p>
<p>「No, even uncle must be in this place...」</p>
<p>「?  It’s stronger to drink, right? </p>
<p>「I-is that so?」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  I believed Isario’s disgusting words!  Come to think of it, I didn’t deny it either. I never thought it would be better to be serious drinking!  </p>
<p>「Yes」</p>
<p>「O-ou!」</p>
<p>  Isario took the bottle with a look of determination. After all, it shouldn’t be a lie if he had come this far.  But is it okay to let him drink here?  What if an unexpected situation arises while Isario was drunk? No, I guess we should just take care of the poison then.  This dad has to take care of what he says.  Isario looked troubled and took a sip of the wine.  Then his eyes widened.  Well, the one inside was the extremely high-ranking wine. It was the so-called spirits.  There were three of them, called spirits, placed in front of Isario. They had a tremendous punch that even an S-ranked adventurer would hesitate to do so.  But Isario did not run away.  He grabbed the bottle with a determined look on his face and began to drink it at once. The average person would probably be defeated by acute alcohol poison.  </p>
<p>『Guys, don’t do anything rash!』</p>
<p>(Master?)</p>
<p>『Even if Fran will be able to drink in the future, you shouldn’t do that way, okay? You’ll have to taste it and drink a little at a time, okay?』</p>
<p>(Okay)</p>
<p> Apparently, he’s become Fran’s On the other hand, he’s also a bad teacher for Fran’s education, but I’ll forgive him this time.  </p>
<p>「Yeah~, it was delicious」</p>
<p>「Yeah」</p>
<p>「T-thanks」</p>
<p>  So, we took a short break. Well, we’ll let him get rid of it when we leave.  Fran, who had erased her chair and table, leaned on Urushi, and Isario sat on a suitable stone. Fran could feel Urushi’s body heat and was in a perfect state.  Isario seemed to be resting her body as well. A strange silence continued for a few minutes, and then Isario suddenly opened his mouth. </p>
<p>「Hey, young miss!」</p>
<p>「What is it?」</p>
<p>「Why did you come to this continent, young miss?」</p>
<p>  Isario’s face had the same relaxed expression as before. I couldn’t tell from his expression whether he was really wondering if he was starting a chat or not.  However, for a little while, his eyes seemed to be more serious than ever. Fran, perhaps realizing this, straightened up her posture for a little while.Well, we’ll just stay at Urushi though.</p>
