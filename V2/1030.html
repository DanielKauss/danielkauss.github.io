</div><h1>Chapter 1030</h1><p>Why is Trismegistus here? Anyway, it’s not a good idea to run away! I quickly activated my short-range teleport to get some distance, but――. </p>
<p>「Don’t hurry. Wait!」</p>
<p>『Wha-!』</p>
<p> Just after the teleport, Trismegistus was already right in front of me. It seemed to have detected my teleportation destination instantly and moved at the same time. This was trying to make a further jump in space, but the moment Trismegistus’ eyes turned to us, the magic power he had gathered for the teleportation dissipated. Was it canceled out this time? The power of that eye? Is that the power of his eyes?  No, before that, why was he here? Wasn’t Trismegistus unable to get out of the barrier of the castle in an instant?  His head was filled with various thoughts, but it was not the time now. In some way, he had to take Isario with him and escape to a safe place.  If teleportation was not good, then telekinesis was.  But that didn’t work in front of Trismegistus either. He was interfered with his magic in some way, and neither his magic nor skills could be activated properly.  Shit!  While I was doing this, I could still feel Isario’s life force! </p>
<p>「I’m telling you to wait」</p>
<p>『Guh!』</p>
<p>  His body stopped moving for a moment.  What the hell?  </p>
<p>「</p>
<p>『Don’t move』</p>
<p>『!』</p>
<p>  That guy’s words...  A verbal ability, huh? The binding power was an instant, but when combined with the ability to cancel out magic power, there was a moment when he was completely neutralized.  They were aiming at me.  This was too fatal. Trismegistus didn’t seem to want to kill me, but I don’t think he would attack us. </p>
<p>「I have no will to attack.」</p>
<p>『?』</p>
<p>「Isario needs to keep defeating the antidemons.  Swords.  </p>
<p>『Don’t move.』</p>
<p> The original sin of jealousy.』</p>
<p>『Huh?  W-What......!』</p>
<p>  Trismegistus stretched out countless black hands toward Isario. I’m sure they were the original sin of jealousy.  I couldn’t dodge them, all I could do is watch the black hands sink into Isario.  What are you trying to do? Are they trying to take away my Divine Sword Release skill?  But a surprising change occurred right in front of me.  To my surprise, Isario’s body was suddenly stable.  His complexion had returned and his wounds had been blocked. More importantly, his life force and magic power had returned to the safety level.  What the hell did he mean?  </p>
<p>「Gfuh. Trismegistus, on the other hand, had greatly reduced his magic power and was vomiting blood from his mouth.  </p>
<p>『What do you mean by robbing him of time?』</p>
<p>「It was all about the physical experience and changes over the past few hours. Instead, I’ve given him magic, life force, and experience.」</p>
<p>  Physical time over the past few hours......?  Does that mean Isario has taken the damage and exhaustion received within the past few hours? So, he was suddenly feeling unwell! If he wasn’t careful, the price might have shifted to Trismegistus. In return, Trismegistus must have given Isario life force and magic power. Trismegistus lost so much that I didn’t think it was equivalent to an exchange, but the fact that it was founded on that showed that the skill was judged to be equivalent.  </p>
<p>「Either way, people’s time is precious and can’t be changed for better or worse.  It’s worth so much to me. The more experience I have, the more valuable it is」</p>
<p>  His expression was as calm as ever, as if he didn’t feel any pain.  However, the damage itself seemed to be. His voice was trembling.  Even so, I wondered if this was the reason why he was so jealous.  He could heal himself by taking away the damage from his opponent.  As I groaned, I felt a presence running toward me. It was Fran.  Even though she couldn’t move as well as before, we must have felt it was dangerous and decided to squeeze our strength.  However, we fell down again a few meters behind. </p>
<p>『Fran! Maximum Heal!』</p>
<p>(Master... , this?)</p>
<p>『I learned a new one.  Don’t be too reckless.  Your body is the limit, okay?』</p>
<p>(But...)</p>
<p>「Daughter and sword, it’s no problem. I’m fine.  I’m no longer going to destroy and take away the sword.」</p>
<p> Oh, now that you mention it, they could steal my telepathy!  </p>
<p>「Fran and Master.  You have shown us your value.」</p>
<p>『So you’re saying that it’s strong and will help us destroy the antidemons?』</p>
<p>「That’s right.」</p>
<p>  That’s a very clear standard of thinking.  I would heal and forgive them because it was useful for my goal. If it had been weaker, I would have been destroyed and deprived of my power here. Come to think of it, Trismegistus would nod without getting any worse.  I know he’s no longer going to target us. </p>
<p>『What did you want to do in the end?』</p>
<p>「That’s a good question. My goal is to create and defeat that huge antidemon.」</p>
<p>『Huh?』</p>
<p>「That’s probably what gave the Abyss Eater a lot of power.  It has given me a lot of power to achieve its mission.」</p>
<p>  Seriously?  Certainly, to create strong antidemons, the Abyss Eater would have to push itself too hard and focus on it. And when that special antidemon was easily defeated, it meant that it was was wasted power. </p>
<p>「Now that we have the key to defeating the failed divine sword wielder and the forces to resist the antidemons, this was our greatest opportunity, and it seems to have worked.」</p>
<p>「The key to this was the Discarded Divine Sword Magic-User, and I have the strength to resist the antidemons now, so this was our greatest opportunity, and it seems to have worked.」</p>
<p>『That’s why we’ve worked with Meritte and Georg.』</p>
<p>「Indeed.  Their work was truly well done.」</p>
<p> There was no emotion on Trismegistus’ face.  There was no joy, no apologies, no anger.  I saw it and understood.  This man was a doll that moved mechanically to achieve the mission given to him by the Gods. To do so, he didn’t think about using others, nor did he think that he was bad.  As the word suggests, he acted to weaken the Abyss Eater and praised his collaborators in form because he had accomplished it. Maybe they were just acting like that.As the word suggests, she acted to weaken the Abyss Eater and, because she had accomplished it, she praised her collaborators as if it was her goal.  Maybe she was just acting on what Juanaverta said, with Trismegistus obeying her orders?  But still, I couldn’t help but question her.  </p>
<p>『A lot of people are dead, aren’t they?』</p>
<p>「It’s another goal too」</p>
<p>『Killing people is our goal......?』</p>
<p>  I could understand that we shouldn’t turn against them, but I could understand why the words were offended. </p>
<p>「I had ordered him to leave several times, but he was still in his presence, so it was necessary.」</p>
<p>  Trismegistus nodded his head without a word. I could understand why he was such a monster because I didn’t sense any madness or malice.I now understand what Isario meant when he said it was a monster.</p>
