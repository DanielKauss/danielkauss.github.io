</div><h1>Chapter 1086</h1><p>Diaz approached one of the mountain dragons, albeit small, but large enough to be compared to the other dragons.</p>
<p>「Guoogh!」</p>
<p>「I wonder if that’s the effect of summoning? That’s very motivating!」</p>
<p>Perhaps recognizing us as enemies from the beginning, the mountain dragon narrowed its golden eyes and glared at Diaz.</p>
<p>They must have been very intimidating, but where did Diaz come from? He then ran in a straight line toward the mountain dragon and unleashed his magic.</p>
<p>「Yes!」</p>
<p>「Woof?」</p>
<p>It was weak fire magic. The mountain dragon’s face looked puzzled, as if it hadn’t expected a blow this weak.</p>
<p>Then she immediately began to show her anger. She must have thought that she had been given a beating.</p>
<p>「Grrrrr!」</p>
<p>「Hahaha! I can’t get a hit on you!」</p>
<p>「Grrrrr!」</p>
<p>The mountain dragon slammed its thick paw at Diaz, but it easily dodged him without a hitch. And sometimes, it threw a counterattack.</p>
<p>Well, all they did was surprise us with their dragon illusions and make a huge sound behind the dragons.</p>
<p>Even so, the mountain dragon that we had never seen before seemed to get caught up in something interesting, and every time it did, it seemed to get angry with Diaz.</p>
<p>This was probably due to Diaz’s good timing, Thought Guidance, and Eye Guidance skills. Even if it didn’t have a dramatic effect, it seemed that even a dragon could be toyed with by an old cunning person like Diaz.</p>
<p>Did Diaz keep holding back a huge dragon for almost five minutes? At first glance, this may seem like a leeway, but a reduction in magic power is a dangerous area. We won’t be able to keep going for another five minutes.</p>
<p>But then, the mountain dragon took a deep breath, as if it had braced itself for not being hit no matter how many times it attacked.</p>
<p>「Lugaaaaaaaahhh!」</p>
<p>「Unfortunately! That’s just an illusion!」</p>
<p>There was a tremendous roar that made even Fran’s ears hurt even at a distance. The mountain dragon didn’t seem to release a breather, but instead, it used a roar with excellent destructive power that took advantage of its huge body.</p>
<p>The earth was heavily gouged around the mountain dragon, and the remnants of which were blown away hundreds of meters. Diaz, who was at the center of the explosion, seemed to be completely involved, but that was not his real body.</p>
<p>Before anyone knew it, he had swapped himself for a dummy made with illusion magic. He had made a wall of earth at a distance of more than 500 meters, hiding in the shadows and roaring.</p>
<p>Even we thought about it before we knew it, but the mountain dragons didn’t understand why.</p>
<p>However, he seemed to have been completely enraged by the fact that this much was mossed by the feathers of the lower rank.</p>
<p>Like a cow in front of us, she scratched the ground a few times with her paws. In fact, it was a signal of a rush. She started to run toward Diaz, swinging through the dungeon and the ground.</p>
<p>Mountain dragons didn’t fly in the sky since they had no wings, but they were capable of running on four legs. Their speed was terrifyingly fast. Or rather, they were about 500 meters for mountain dragons over 100 meters.</p>
<p>Within a few steps, he was already closing in on Diaz. He was going to blow Diaz away with that rush of destroying even the city walls with a single blow.</p>
<p>Diaz ran away in a somewhat panic, but the mountain dragon followed Diaz with a surprisingly sharp turn. It seemed to have bent its huge body well by releasing magic power.</p>
<p>But this was exactly what made up Diaz’s trap. It seemed that what he was in a hurry was an act. As soon as Diaz started to smirk with a nasty smile on his face, something burst out.</p>
<p>「Binding of Ten Thousand Threads!」</p>
<p>「Wrrrooof!」</p>
<p>At that place, a group of threads that Fermus had prepared over the past five minutes was hidden. As the name of the technique suggested, nearly 10,000 threads were tangled around the dragon’s limbs, blocking its movement.</p>
<p>They were facing mountain dragons, which boasted high power among the dragon species. It must be impossible to restrain them completely. The strings were cut apart in no time at all.</p>
<p>However, while he was forcibly bent, he got his legs tangled up. That was a fatal imbalance. The mountain dragon lost its stance and collapsed to the side, chipping away at the earth and falling.</p>
<p>「Are you sure?」</p>
<p>Our follow up attack was Eiworth.</p>
<p>The feet and face of the mountain dragon were getting covered with ice. The ice on his face was reddish-purple in color. I guess it was specially made ice with poison in it.</p>
<p>The feet of the mountain dragons also froze, turning into an ice field.</p>
<p>Half panicked after his face was covered with poison and ice, the mountain dragon tried to get up and wake up. Then he slipped on his feet and collapsed again.</p>
<p>「Uwahaha! Young individuals are easier to fit in!」</p>
<p>So this was the reason he froze his feet. Because of the ice on his feet and the frozen ground under his feet, the mountain dragons were unable to stand properly. His vision was also taken away by the ice on his face, so he must not have noticed.</p>
<p>That’s why the mountain dragons began to struggle to figure out what to do with the ice on its face first――.</p>
<p>「Hey young miss! I hit the target with a magic stone! And then you hit it with a big one!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Gamudo began to move, not missing the opportunity of the mountain dragon. In his hand is not the hammer he had been using up until now, but a deadly hammer with a pointed tip.</p>
<p>Name: Dragon Panisher</p>
<p>ATK: 1099</p>
<p>Mana Conductivity: B+</p>
<p>Skill: Scale Piercing, Explosion, One-point Concentration, suicide bomb.</p>
<p>It’s a consumable weapon that penetrates even the scales of a dragon, but it only breaks once. Moreover, it seems that the user is damaged by the backlash of using it.</p>
<p>Only the tough Gamudo could use this weapon to its fullest potential. It was an overly sharp weapon.</p>
<p>「Dooooooooaaahhh!」</p>
<p>Gamudo, who had jumped upwards using a magic tool, struck a dragon panicker at the base of the mountain dragon’s neck.</p>
