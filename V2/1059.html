</div><h1>Chapter 1059</h1><p>Fran and Urushi, who had begun action to rescue their acquaintances, rushed to their side at once using teleportation. The Raydossian soldiers were in complete chaos when the girl and the wolf suddenly appeared and began to attack the surroundings. After using Fran and Urushi’s attacks to blow away the nearby soldiers, I activated several land spells on them. </p>
<p>『Great Wall!』</p>
<p> We enclosed all sides of the captives and separated ourselves from the surrounding Raydoss soldiers. The inside of the wall was wide enough that even Urushi’s giant body would leave a bit of room for leeway. The inside of the wall was large enough for Urushi to remain a little relaxed even if he grew huge.  Because of this, the Raidos soldiers remained inside, but we eliminated them with a quick attack. There was one person who seemed to be important, so we only needed to paralyze them and secure them.  Outside the wall, the screams and shouts of the Raidos soldiers were ringing. At this rate, it would take some time for them to break through.  Fortunately, the handcuffs on the adventurers’ arms and legs were not magic tools. Besides, the slave collars had not yet been used.  As Fran cut off the shackles on their hands and feet, she began to remove the gagged stones on her own.  </p>
<p>「Everyone!  Are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Fran-san?  Why are you here......?」</p>
<p>「I came to help you.」</p>
<p>  When Fran told them so, the adventurers gasped for relief.  Eugene hugged their fellow adventurers, while Maia hugged them and shouted. The others seemed to be relieved as well. Judith smiled, tears build up in the corners of his eyes and hugged Fran as he thanked her. </p>
<p>「Thank you, very much.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>  Fran patted her on the back, and then she killed her voice and began to tremble. She must have been worried for a long time.  I wanted to slowly appease Judith, but there was no time to waste.  </p>
<p>『Fran, our priority now is to get away from here』</p>
<p>(Yeah)</p>
<p> Besides, there was not a single person Fran wanted to save.  </p>
<p>「What about Charlotte?」</p>
<p>「That’s because one of them got taken somewhere...」</p>
<p>「... Oi!」</p>
<p>  and </p>
<p>「Hiiii!」</p>
<p>  They woke up the elderly man who had been paralyzing and interrogated him. Since it was an emergency, the interrogation was quick and rough, but it couldn’t be helped, right? My fellow adventurers were a little off, but I was able to get some information about her.  Raidos Kingdom, which had taken note of Charlotte’s special skills, had captured her in a building in the center of town. Only the upper echelons of the invasion army knew her purpose, but they were said to have been captured in the center of the town along with the other captives.  The adventurers here were supposed to be transported by ship to the Raidos Kingdom and made into slaves. </p>
<p>『For now, let’s get them out of here』</p>
<p>「Nn.  Guys, ride on Urushi」</p>
<p>「O-Okay」</p>
<p>  Fran urged them to ride on the back of the giant Urushi.  Many were hesitant, but as the Scarlet Maidens took the lead and began to climb up on Urushi, their guards seemed to have weakened. They all began to climb on Urushi’s back.  The adventurers of Barbra had known Urushi for a long time already. They must have realized that he was a wolf who had been fooling around while swinging his darlings beside Fran.  Urushi’s back is in a normal state, but I wonder if it’ll be okay. Please hold on to his fur.  </p>
<p>「Urushi, please」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  Urushi slowly started to move so as not to swing the adventurers on his back. It would be dangerous to suddenly run up from an angle, so it was little by little to increase his altitude.  It would be good from the ground if we don’t do something, so Fran and I will stay as bait.  </p>
<p>『Let’s go!』</p>
<p>「Nn!  Phew――Shii!」</p>
<p>  Fran flashed me inside the wall. The slashed Great Wall slowly fell on all sides.  </p>
<p>「G-Girl, get down!」</p>
<p>「Ugyaaah!」</p>
<p>  With the tremor, we heard the soldiers’ screams and the dull sound of something soft crushing. The sudden tragedy has frozen the soldiers of the Raidos Kingdom. But Fran has no mercy for them. </p>
<p>「Haaaah!」</p>
<p> She leapt into the soldiers in front of her and slashed at the soldiers one after another.  </p>
<p>「Teyaaa!」</p>
<p>『Eat this!  Burst Flame!』</p>
<p> I chose the most flashy spell I could to cause chaos among the soldiers.  The attacks were launched sporadically toward Urushi, but gradually, the attacks on the ground were focused on Fran.  What we were worried about was their flying force. The adventurers on their backs would be in danger if they were attacked from all sides by magic beasts other than Lesser Rock.  But what if there was a commotion in the harbor that caused continuous pillar of fire? They’re coming here as expected. </p>
<p>『Let’s go even flashier!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  To protect her comrades.  And to vent her anger towards the Kingdom of Raidos, which was smoking inside of her. Fran went on a rampage.  She slashed and slashed at the soldiers who rushed in, and sometimes dispelled them with various spells. Soldiers came all over the town as she had hoped, but no matter how many people there were, she couldn’t stop Fran.  </p>
<p>「Gyaaah!」</p>
<p>「Shiit! Why are there so many girls like this!?」</p>
<p> The invasion continued.</p>
<p>「I don’t want to die.」</p>
