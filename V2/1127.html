</div><h1>Chapter 1127</h1><p>The main force of our Adventurers Guild was the Knights of the Kranzel Kingdom, who along with the Knights of the Raidos Kingdom, was engaged in an army clash with the Kingdom of Raidos. The location was a Swift Fort built on a hilly area south-east of the Raidos Kingdom, and it was a key force in the defense of the largest city in the south, the Raidos Kingdom, “Rage Hil”. We didn’t even know the geography of the area before we attacked Raidos, but a rough map was created based on information from the captured villages and captives and documents obtained from our base.Our location was a Swift fort built on a hilly area in the south-eastern part of the Raidos Kingdom.  It was a key defensive feature in front of the largest city in the southern part, the “Large Hil”.  We didn’t even know the geography before we attacked Raidos, but a rough map was created based on information from the occupied villages and captives and from documents obtained from our strongholds.Before we attacked Raydoss, we didn’t know much about the geography of the area, but a rough map was created based on information from the occupied villages and captives and from materials obtained from our strongholds.  It was obvious from that map, but if we drop Swiss Fort, the southern part of Raydoss would be completely separated.  If we go any further to the north, we will see a flat area, but this area was dominated by a magic forest and mountainous areas where many magic beasts lurk. If we couldn’t use the road running in all directions around the Swift Fort, it would be difficult to even move properly through the southern part of Raidos Kingdom. In the Kranzel Kingdom, lodging towns could be built at the points where these roads are gathered, but Raidos seems to be thinking first about building up forts and protecting their distribution routes.  The knights and adventurers must have been off guard by the fact that they were able to drop such a fort so easily. Based on the information they had obtained from the scout, they attacked the Swift Fort with their unchanged formation.  Without even knowing it was a trap for Raidos...  The first unusual report came from the scout’s brigade that went behind the fort. They were surprise troops who would be deployed secretly from the back entrance of the fort, as well as troops who were responsible for blocking supplies coming from the outside.  At this point, the Kranzel Kingdom still thought they had an overwhelming advantage. There were only a few soldiers trapped in the fort, and the fort’s defense was not so strong. They had been planning to encircle it and slowly advance through the fort as before.  However, the first bad news came immediately after the war broke out.  About 500 undead had been attacked and destroyed by the same number of undead. Moreover, they did not know where the undead that had retreated had disappeared.  Was there some kind of hidden passageway somewhere?  Or was there some Jean-level magician there?  Either way, it’s not as simple as it used to be. It won’t be that simple.  That feeling is confirmed by the next report.  The long-range magic from the fort had damaged the front lines.  There were magicians among the enemy soldiers before, but there were not many of them.  However, that fort was full of magicians who deployed troops.  It was a force that could not be ignored. After all, we could not let our guards down this battle.  However, Kranzel’s commanders seemed to have little sense of urgency. They tried to suggest a change in strategy, but I didn’t expect them to be drinking tea in the camp.  </p>
<p>「So you’re not going to change your strategy as we are now?」</p>
<p>「Yes.  We will send another antidemon brigade and attack them head-on. We’ll launch our raid on you guys now」</p>
<p>「That fort is quite dangerous, so you need to correct your strategy!」</p>
<p>「Hmph.  You can destroy the traps head-on.  Don’t argue with us, adventurers! Just follow us in silence!」</p>
<p>  The nobleman, one of the commanders of this army, replied to my words with an annoyed look on his face.  Each nobleman led their own troops to participate in the battle, but this man was the one who led the most troops in the army. He had a title as well as a title of Count and had a lot of say in the battle.  He had been providing support for the people in the rear, but he seemed to think that the upcoming fortification attack was the most important part of the war.They had been providing support for the antidemon hordes for a long time, but they seemed to see this kind of fortification as the main force of the war.  They had been involved in a strategy council that used to send substitutes, but they had been planning the strategy themselves.  Until now, they had only been staffed by knights and high-ranking adventurers, but...  He could not afford to offend the nobles with their 3,000 soldiers, so his words were accepted. Well, the plan itself was to take over their strategy, and we hadn’t heard rumors that they were greedy but incompetent.  However, because of this, they misunderstood that we would follow them.  It seems that they don’t know that the will of the knights is their top priority on the battlefield.  Kranzel’s law told them to follow the knights on the battlefield. Well, even so, it was not possible to despise the nobles, but we were still allowed to disobey their will.  Moreover, the guild was given great authority this time, so we were not obliged to obey them unconditionally.Moreover, the guild had been given a lot of authority this time, so they were not obliged to obey unconditionally.  The adventurers were all agreeing that they would not be tolerated by the nobles for making reckless achievements, and I came to voice my disagreement.  I don’t understand why it’s me.  I know it’s because the commander, Forrund, is not very good at speaking.  But there are other high-ranked adventurers, right? Well, I guess they have more contact with nobles though......  </p>
<p>「But wouldn’t the mobile striker make sense if they can’t find us now?」</p>
<p>「We’ll now send a thousand times larger! Now all we have to do is turn the undead who attacked us into enemies!」</p>
<p>「We won’t send adventurers out to those people, are we?」</p>
<p>「What!  I’m sure there’s plenty of adventurers left over!」</p>
<p>「We don’t have any leftovers.  All of them have some kind of work assigned to them, and you don’t have the authority to command them. If you want to do it, just divide it up based on your own forces」</p>
<p>「But――」</p>
<p> Isn’t this guy incompetent at all? No, he’s not just incompetent, he’s just so greedy that he can’t see what’s around him?  In this case, it seems that Zenos-sama, who was said to be incompetent, was more capable than Zenos-sama. He understands that he has no ability and won’t be reckless.  Besides, he has enough loyalty to send troops to a talented commander. As expected, if he was rude to the royals, he would be sternly moved to protect their faces, but he was usually a eagle and easy to deal with.  Anyway, after a useless argument, I managed to get a word out of him. I don’t think the adventurers would die in vain now that they had been caught up in reckless operations. As I was relieved, I heard a loud scream behind me.  On closer inspection, I saw that a noble army posted in the back was attacked by the undead.  I had seen this scene before, just like the battle that Jean had fought when he exterminated the Raidos Kingdom. The position is reversed, but this is not good.  If there is a caster on par with Jean, the army would swell by devouring noble soldiers. We must hurry and go to the rescue――  </p>
<p>「D-Donad-san!」</p>
<p>「What’s wrong!」</p>
<p>「Enemy army is coming out of the fort!」</p>
<p>「What!?」</p>
<p> Just as his subordinates shouted, the gate to the Swift Fort was opened and we saw the knights in red armor flooding into the air.  </p>
<p>「Shit!  We have to hold on to that side, okay!  Adventurers!This isn’t good. If there’s a caster on par with Jean, the army would swell by devouring the soldiers of nobility. We have to hurry and go to the rescue―― </p>
<p>「D-Donad-san!」</p>
<p>「What’s wrong!」</p>
<p>「Enemy army is coming out of the fort!」</p>
<p>「What!?」</p>
<p> Just as his subordinates shouted, the gate to the Swift Fort was opened and we saw the knights in red armor flooding into the air. </p>
<p>「Shit! We have to hold on to that side, okay! Adventurers! You can get close to me!」</p>
