</div><h1>Chapter 1112</h1><p>While evading and defending, she jumped around the Great Spirit to look for its nucleus. Then, Marr, who should have been asleep inside Fran, woke up and began to release her power.</p>
<p>『Fran, how is it?』</p>
<p>(Mal is guiding us!)</p>
<p>Fran stared at the upper half of the Great Spirit’s body. With Maar’s assistance, she seemed to be able to sense the presence of the spirit even more than before.</p>
<p>At this rate, we might be able to find the nucleus of the Great Spirit in no time.</p>
<p>However, it seemed that even the Great Spirit had sensed Marl’s magic power. They would take their next step to making sure that we eliminated the dangerous opponent.</p>
<p>「Gwah!」</p>
<p>『Fran!』</p>
<p>「......!」</p>
<p>Fran let out a sobbing scream, which instantly lost its blood and turned white. She was holding her throat with her hand and moving her mouth, but no voice. It was as if she was suffocating――.</p>
<p>『So that means it’s me!』</p>
<p>I quickly used my wind magic to send the wind out of Fran’s mouth. At the same time, Fran was coughing violently and regaining her voice.</p>
<p>「Gehoh! Gohoh! Hahah......」</p>
<p>I don’t even know the composition of the air in this world, and I don’t even know if the living being was sucking oxygen or not. However, there was no doubt that there was some kind of substance that was necessary to breathe. The great spirit manipulated it to suffocate Fran.</p>
<p>Fran was used to the pain and shock, but this was the first time she had ever suffocated. As expected, her movements had stopped.</p>
<p>Naturally, the number of interceptors had decreased, and the wind of the Great Spirit’s control rushed in at once.</p>
<p>『Uwooooh!』</p>
<p>I activated a large amount of magic at once and scattered it around the area. It was bad, it felt cold. The use of magic had exceeded the limit. But even so, it hadn’t filled Fran’s hole.</p>
<p>Countless wounds had been drilled through Fran’s body, with blood flying everywhere.</p>
<p>「At any rate, we need to take her to a place where she can rest. What do you think?」</p>
<p>Swoop.</p>
<p>For a moment, something was wriggling within me. It was as if it was exposing its existence. And at the same time, it was giving off an evil energy.</p>
<p>Fragment of the Evil God was appealing to me that I could use my power? With that in mind, I remembered what I saw in the lake of the Kingdom of Belios.</p>
<p>It was the scene where Sierra used the Evil Spirit of the magic sword, Zelos Reed, to cancel out Zelyse’s skill. Since I could borrow power from the Evil God Fragment, wouldn’t I be able to do the same thing?</p>
<p>Amid the thoughts flowing at super high speed, I immediately moved into action. I didn’t have time to hesitate.</p>
<p>Lend me your strength, Evil God!</p>
<p>There was no response from the Evil God Fragment, but I felt less resistance when drawing out the Evil Spirit.</p>
<p>I felt as if an Evil Spirit was being drawn from a piece of the Evil God――or rather, it even sent evil spirits out from the other side. Sierra used evil spirits as a chain and wrapped it around his opponent to use it.</p>
<p>But I had to intercept the attacks that were pouring down from all around me. Then it was not a chain, but a wall. All I had to do was create an evil barrier.</p>
<p>『Uwooooh!』</p>
<p>Without interrupting the barriers we were currently maintaining and the magic of intercepting them, we created a new evil barrier! I can tell that we’re beyond our own limit, but this is where we have to compete!</p>
<p>Just as I had hoped, the evil wall of energy completely canceled out the wind attacks, and the surrounding area calmed down at once.</p>
<p>But I was a little surprised. I couldn’t call it a disappointment. The burden of creating an evil barrier was less than I had imagined. It was as if something was splitting the burden for me.</p>
<p>I felt a small hint of assistance from the Evil God Fragment, but there’s more to it――?</p>
<p>(Master?)</p>
<p>『Oops. Fran, are you okay?』</p>
<p>(Nn. Suddenly, I can’t breathe)</p>
<p>I knew it.</p>
<p>Now I’m circulating the air with my wind magic, but my opponent was the Great Spirit of Wind. I’m one of the best class of opponents in the world in terms of manipulating wind. I don’t even know if this will be able to keep me from suffocating attacks for long.</p>
<p>(This wall of evil energy, Master?)</p>
<p>『Yeah. But this is not going to end well after all』</p>
<p>I activated Magic Absorption and Magic Plunder with all my might, but it drained a lot of magic power. At this rate, I would only be able to maintain it for about a minute.</p>
<p>(Master, please stay like this. I’ll find the nucleus.)</p>
<p>『Okay, I’ll protect it with everything I’ve got. Fran, focus all your attention on looking for the spirit’s core』</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
<p>If Fran asked me to, I can’t just make a mess of it! I won’t even let it scratch Fran’s orb skin!</p>
<p>I will protect Fran who had stopped by using Simultaneous Operations at full power. Not only did I maintain an evil barrier, but I must also try to not affect her as much as possible so as not to disturb her concentration.</p>
<p>Even the slight swinging of her bangs in the wind might be a hindrance. She could then concentrate more on her magic and danger detection and intercept any powerful attacks that might even break through the evil barrier.</p>
<p>『Doryaaaaaah!』</p>
<p>The attacks of the Great Spirit were becoming more fierce than ever. The power, range, and frequency of the attacks had increased, and it was like a storm wall covering all of us.</p>
<p>I could see the earth being carved into a bowl around the place where Fran was standing.</p>
<p>The mana was terrible, but the chill was terrible. At this rate, it was almost as long as I could feel the pain. If we went that far, it really was a dangerous signal.</p>
<p>Still? Kuaa――</p>
<p>(Master! Got it!)</p>
<p>『Really!?』</p>
<p>That’s Fran! Thank you!</p>
<p>(Let’s get closer!)</p>
<p>『Alright! Leave it to us to pave the way!』</p>
<p>「Nn! Let’s go!」</p>
