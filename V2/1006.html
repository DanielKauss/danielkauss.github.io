</div><h1>Chapter 1006</h1><p>「There’s no way I can’t help but make a few sacrifices to destroy the dragonkin!」</p>
<p> Maybe he was agitated, but Mertlyte was breathing heavily, her shoulders up and down. Her beautiful face was distorted into a prajna-like appearance. Her mind now seemed to be eroded by her insanity. </p>
<p>「...I know how much you want to take revenge on me.」</p>
<p> Fran’s words showed how strong her feelings were. She must have remembered that she had a grudge against the entire blue cat race before. She must have remembered that she had a grudge against the entire blue cat race before.  </p>
<p>「You’d better not hesitate! So, you’re saying you’re going to let me off the hook then?」</p>
<p>「That’s not it.  I can’t blame you for the small sacrifices.  Besides, there are many people on this continent that I want to protect. So, I’ll take you down.」</p>
<p>  Fran held me up with a sad expression.  She had no intention of persuading Meritte. She probably replaced me with her own body and knew that reason couldn’t stop.  Even Fran had no idea what would happen if the black cats were in the same eye.  </p>
<p>「I’ll kill you first!  And I’ll punish all the criminals who lurk in this continent! Until then, I won’t stop!」</p>
<p>「I won’t let you!」</p>
<p>「Death!」</p>
<p>  That shout was the signal for the start of the battle.  Meritte and Fran began moving at the same time, slamming their weapons against each other.  </p>
<p>「That sword...  It’s not just any magic sword! How can you ever cut it off and not break it!」</p>
<p>「The best sword!」</p>
<p>  Meritte was much stronger than I had imagined.  His stats were quite high, maybe even those of a high-ranking antidemon.  The thin arms that slammed against my blade had unusually high power. Her eyesight seemed to be away from humans, and she was handling Fran’s sword well.  However, Fran was clearly better at swordsmanship. Gradually, my defenses stopped working, and finally, my magic caught him.  </p>
<p>「Kuh!  I’m not even going to use any magic!」</p>
<p> The main body of the robe didn’t seem to be badly damaged, but it was burned by lightning and flame magic, and its half-broken robe was completely burned down. As a result, I had succeeded in appraising Merritte completely.  </p>
<p>『Your race is not just a lorelei?  You mean an antidemon?  Just like Nadia!』</p>
<p>  Just like a high-ranking antidemon, your body is already half-burned. On closer inspection, I saw that the body under your clothes was hardened.  There were no features on the face or hands, but it seemed that your torso had already been mutated into that of an antidemon.  When Fran saw this, her eyes widened. After seeing that, both Nadia and Dab couldn’t help but get freaked out.  Mertritte must have sensed Fran’s surprise. She smirked, lightly waving off the exposed chest.  </p>
<p>「Is this?  That’s wonderful, isn’t it?」</p>
<p>「...... The body of an antidemon......?」</p>
<p>「Yes, it is. Did you know that it’s a failed divine sword?」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>「Heeh?  You can give me a quick explanation.  Both of these swords are failed divine swords. I used their wonderful power to obtain this body.」</p>
<p>  I never thought there would be any other failed divine swords left behind besides Overgrowth! Moreover, they were in a state where the two were fused.  Was it a falldown sword or an Evil Eater? Either of them had some ability similar to Overgrowth.  </p>
<p>「Did you do it yourself?」</p>
<p>「That’s right. I’m gonna do it if I want to get the power to fight!」</p>
<p>  With the release of the antidemonization, there was no longer the need to suppress their power anymore. Meritte began to move even faster than before, fully utilizing her distinctive antidemon power. However, his attacks never hit Fran.  </p>
<p>「Why...  can you avoid them!」</p>
<p>「They’re fast, but that’s all.  How to attack them must be exposed.」</p>
<p>「Then how about this! Haaa!」</p>
<p>「No hits!」</p>
<p>「Damn!  Don’t do it!」</p>
<p>  It’s a tricky attack because of his physical ability and the cross-shaped magic sword, which is a failed divine sword. That was what we tried to take at first, but once we got used to it, it was not Fran’s opponent.  The level of our swordsmanship was way too great. Meritte was indeed strong, but rather, his strength as a rearguard.  Now it’s Meritte’s turn to defend. He was able to use his reflexes that transcend human flesh to manage to catch Fran’s attacks.  However, he could not defend everything perfectly, and shallow wounds were carved into his skin.  Apparently, antidemons were becoming more numerous than on the outside. There was no blood at all from the wounds, and it regenerated in an instant.  The look was the same as that of a high-ranking antidemon.  This would be meaningless if she had to use a small attack.  A big move would have to kill him all at once. He must be confident in his immortality.  Sensing this, Fran calmly kneaded her power while attacking. She was aware of the magic power that was dormant inside her, even though she had made enough moves to block Meritte’s attack.  I never thought that Fran, who had been feeling headaches just by activating the magic in two, would be able to use this much of her Parallel Thought. Apart from the magic power used in the battle, magic power with the divine attribute was also developed inside Fran.  Meritte seemed to have noticed too.  A relaxed smile twitched slightly. But she didn’t have time to escape anymore.  </p>
<p>(Master!)</p>
<p>『Ou!』</p>
<p> As Fran stepped forward, I slammed my full telekinesis against the cross-shaped magic sword that Meritte was holding.  It seemed that she had noticed the invisible power with a keen sense, but she couldn’t dodge at this close range.  Although she didn’t let go of the sword, the sword and her hand snapped up. Fran was already right in front of her when Meritte was about to pull back the cross-shaped magic sword. </p>
<p>「...!」</p>
<p>  Meritte’s face contorted in frustration as she realized that she was unable to make it in time. She must have not expected a girl as a bonus from an S-ranked adventurer to be able to do this much.  </p>
<p>(Now that she can use it, she can use it)</p>
<p>  Fran was clad in the magic power of the divine attribute.As soon as Fran muttered these words, he unleashed a slash at a godspeed, which flew right through Merritte’s torso.</p>
