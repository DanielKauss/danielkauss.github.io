</div><h1>Chapter 1044</h1><p>「Well, it can’t be helped. We’re in a great hurry after losing the Divine Sword Knight」</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>Sophie and Yagilale followed Fran, who was surprised to hear Mea’s words.</p>
<p>「He said he has lost his Divine Sword Knight... Eh? He’s dead?」</p>
<p>「Is that so?」</p>
<p>Was Adoll dead? But I have certainly not confirmed her to be safe...</p>
<p>「I’m not saying I’m dead.」</p>
<p>「What’s that? I’m confused」</p>
<p>It’s the truth!</p>
<p>「So, you mean you’ve lost it?」</p>
<p>「They don’t seem to be able to see us. Apparently, they had escaped, so Quina had been investigating it. I’m sure of it」</p>
<p>「What happened to the Divine Sword?」</p>
<p>「It seems you didn’t take it with you. If you steal the Divine Sword, you will be chased to the ends of the earth. It looked obedient, but I’m sure you had a lot of it in your mind」</p>
<p>「Yeah. And Addle is...」</p>
<p>Fran muttered with a complicated expression on her face.</p>
<p>Addle was not something Fran could like, partly because she didn’t like to go, but it was still a very rough position for her as a comrade-in-arms.</p>
<p>Maybe he was involved in the story of selling Sophie, but I don’t think that guy would be involved in such a conspiracy. Rather than not doing it out of his personality, I think he couldn’t just sit and interact with the other country.</p>
<p>Rather than him being the mastermind, it makes more sense to think that Silard’s intelligence and dark circles were setting up schemes in various places using the name of the Divine Sword Knight.</p>
<p>「So Silard was trying to take me by force......」</p>
<p>「It’s just like a way to kidnap their country. If they managed to get away from the Divine Sword Knight and return to their country in a little while, they won’t even know what kind of punishment they’ll get. Therefore, I’d like to bring the strong back and score some points.」</p>
<p>When they returned to their country, they would have a replacement for the Divine Sword Knights. But they hadn’t brought them with them now, so they must have approached Fran and Sophie.</p>
<p>Especially in Sophie’s case, she was definitely a Divine Swordsman.</p>
<p>The solicitation must have been quite fierce. They must have obeyed her after hearing her secret contract with the Medical Director.</p>
<p>「If we’re going to that country, it’d be better to die on this continent!」</p>
<p>「Then, what about our country?」</p>
<p>「Eh?」</p>
<p>Sophie’s eyes were on Yagilale’s words. She probably didn’t expect him to accept the solicitation while exposing his disgust for the solicitation.</p>
<p>Those words even reached Mea.</p>
<p>「We can go to our country too! If you’re a Divine Swordsman, we’re more than welcome! Of course, let’s accept the people of Nocta!」</p>
<p>「Ah! That’s terrible, Nemea-sama! The same goes for our country!」</p>
<p>「Umm?」</p>
<p>「Don’t worry, I’m not going to bind you to a bad contract. Well, as a servant of the country, if you have a stray Divine Sword user, you can’t solicit them」</p>
<p>「Me too. Besides, I’m confident that it’s a better option than Silard」</p>
<p>「Indeed! It’s better than Silard!」</p>
<p>In other words, they would be willing to talk to them if they don’t have any other choice. I wanted to tell them to talk to us, rather than worrying about the people of Nocta.</p>
<p>「But Sophie was originally a nobleman of some country, wasn’t she? I heard that your foster father was a musician and a nobleman. Can’t you just ignore him?」</p>
<p>「That is...」</p>
<p>Apparently, Mea had asked Sophie about her situation halfway through. She casually asked her about Sophie’s foster father.</p>
<p>However, after seeing Sophie’s expression, they immediately understood that something was off.</p>
<p>「What the hell was that? That’s right! It could have been someone else」</p>
<p>She said that out loud, but Sophie immediately shook her head and started telling us about her situation, as if she had overcome the trauma of the past.</p>
<p>「Yeah. I can’t just keep ignoring my foster father, right――」</p>
<p>Her story was almost the same as before. A swirling story about her love, hatred, and past, with complicated feelings for her foster father.</p>
<p>She was still a hard child as usual. Fran was the one with the majority of her injuries, but Sophie had a very tough life too.</p>
<p>Mea had also lost her word. However, Yagilale seemed to have a thoughtful expression on her face.</p>
<p>「You said your foster father’s name was Rober Sarrath-dono?」</p>
<p>「You know them?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. He was a famous person on the continent of Capul.」</p>
<p>The Kingdom of Segilusel is said to be located in the northern part of the Capul continent. It was a continent on the opposite side of Gordicia from the continent of Zilberd, where the Kingdom of Kranzel is located.</p>
<p>Sophie was also from the continent of Capul.</p>
<p>「As the leader of the knights, I have heard much about the incident. However, I was confused because what I heard was very different from what I had heard」</p>
<p>「What do you mean?」</p>
<p>「It’s the case of Viscount Sarras, but ostensibly they are in conflict with the bandit brigade.」</p>
<p>「Apparently...?」</p>
<p>「Yeah」</p>
<p>From Sophie’s point of view, her foster father had led a mercenary group to attack her native village and kill her family.</p>
<p>However, Yagilale told us that Viscount Sarras was led by a group of serious criminal slaves, and the one who fought was the bandit group that occupied the village. And then the fight went to an end and the Viscount was left behind.</p>
<p>「That is reported to my country」</p>
<p>「No...... That’s because...」</p>
<p>Sophie stared at Yagilale with a confused look on her face. She must have no idea how she would react now that the tragedy she had believed had been denied.</p>
<p>「We have an allied relationship with his country, and our country’s personnel are also participating in the investigation. I wonder if that is the case」</p>
<p>「So what about the village where I was born? Who about Dad, Mom, and sister? Was I a thief’s child? Or was it all a lie? What was it true?」</p>
<p>「I’m sorry, it seems you got me confused. But Sarras-dono was a person who could be called a music maniac, but not a malice. Sophie-dono must have been put on a show to let her experience various emotions」</p>
<p>「B-But then I killed my foster father――」</p>
<p>Sophie clogged up her words and suddenly sat down there, mumbling something for a while with a gloomy expression on her face.</p>
<p>「Sophie, are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Fran...」</p>
<p>「Sophie, weren’t you sure your foster father was satisfied?」</p>
<p>「What do you mean......?」</p>
<p>「I went back to listening to the ultimate music in a state where I had no hope of life. I guess I really wanted to go.」</p>
<p>「Sure thing! Such a thing...!」</p>
<p>Sophie’s words lost power as she tried to refute Mea. She must have realized somewhere along the line that this might be the case. I guess that was the personality of Viscount Sarras I heard about.</p>
<p>「First, we have to find out how true it is.」</p>
<p>「Let me help you too」</p>
<p>「Thank you」</p>
<p>「But that’s good to hear」</p>
<p>「Eh?」</p>
<p>「Because Mom and Dad might be still alive.」</p>
<p>「Ugh! Yeah! That’s right...」</p>
<p>Because Fran had lost her parents, her words had a different weight. Sophie rolled her eyes in surprise, then nodded her head with a complicated look on her face.</p>
