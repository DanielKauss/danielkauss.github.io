</div><h1>Chapter 1030</h1><p>Why is Trismegistus here?</p>
<p>Anyway, we’ll have to get out of here!</p>
<p>I quickly activated my short-range teleport to get some distance, but...</p>
<p>「Just hurry. Wait.」</p>
<p>『Wha!?』</p>
<p>Trismegistus was right in front of me right after my teleportation. He must have sensed my teleportation destination instantly and moved at the same time.</p>
<p>This was bad and I was about to leap into space, but the moment Trismegistus’ eyes turned toward us, the magic power I had gathered for the teleportation dissipated. It was canceled out now? Is that the power of his eyes?</p>
<p>「Trismegistus......」</p>
<p>Various thoughts filled my mind in an instant, but now was not the time. I must somehow bring Isario to escape to a safe place.</p>
<p>If teleportation wasn’t good, then telekinesis was the better choice.</p>
<p>However, that was also meaningless in front of Trismegistus. It seems that magic was interfered with in some way, and neither magic nor skills could be activated properly.</p>
<p>Shit! While all this was going on, Isario’s vitality was still there!</p>
<p>「I’m saying 『Wait』」</p>
<p>『Guh!』</p>
<p>My body stopped moving for a moment. What the hell?</p>
<p>「『Don’t move.』</p>
<p>『!』</p>
<p>My words... A verbal ability, huh? The binding power was instantaneous, but combined with the ability to cancel out magic power, there was a moment when I was completely rendered powerless.</p>
<p>They were all aiming at me. This was way too fatal.</p>
<p>I couldn’t sense any killing intent from Trismegistus, but this guy would probably never do anything like that when he attacked his opponent.</p>
<p>「I have no intention of attacking.」</p>
<p>『?』</p>
<p>「Isario needs to keep defeating the antidemons. Sword, 『Don’t move. This is the source of your jealousy.」</p>
<p>『Huh? W-What...!?』</p>
<p>There were countless black hands stretched out from Trismegistus to Isario. That must be the source of his jealousy.</p>
<p>I couldn’t duck either, all I could do was to see my black hand sinking into Isario. What am I going to do? Are I going to take away the Divine Sword Release skill too?</p>
<p>But then a surprising change occurred in front of me. To my surprise, Isario’s body was rapidly stable. His complexion had returned and he had covered his wounds. And above all, his life force and mana had recovered to a safe zone.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>「Fufu... I’ve forced time out of Isario’s body...」</p>
<p>Trismegistus, on the other hand, had greatly reduced his magic power and was vomiting blood from his mouth.</p>
<p>『You took my time, huh?』</p>
<p>「I only had a few hours of physical experience and change. Instead, I gave you magic, life force, and experience」</p>
<p>For the past few hours of my body......? Does that mean that Isario had taken the damage and wear and tear from within the few hours? So, I was suddenly feeling sick!</p>
<p>If we were not careful, the price might have shifted to Trismegistus.</p>
<p>Instead, Trismegistus must have given Isario life force and mana.</p>
<p>Trismegistus lost his sanity and was not considered to be an equivalent exchange, but the fact that it was realized seemed that his skill judged this to be equivalent.</p>
<p>「Time is a valuable thing that can’t be changed, for better or for worse. It is worth it. The more experience I have, the more it is worth.」</p>
<p>His expression was as calm as ever, as if he didn’t feel any pain. But it seemed that he had taken some damage, and his voice trembled.</p>
<p>But still, I wondered if there was such a way to use jealousy against him. By taking away the damage of his opponent, he could heal them.</p>
<p>As I groaned, I felt a presence running toward us. It was Fran.</p>
<p>They must have been unable to move well earlier, but they must have sensed how dangerous we were and squeezed our strength back. However, they fell again a few meters behind us. I couldn’t get up just like that.</p>
<p>『Fran! Maximum Heal!』</p>
<p>(Master... Is this so?)</p>
<p>『I’ve learned a new one. Don’t be too reckless. Your body is at its limit, okay?』</p>
<p>(But......)</p>
<p>「Obey, girl and sword. I have no more intention of destroying and taking away the sword.」</p>
<p>Oops, Come to think of it, these guys should be able to steal my telepathy!</p>
<p>「Fran, Master. You have shown me your value.」</p>
<p>『So you’re saying they’re so strong that they’re useful for eliminating antidemons?』</p>
<p>「Yeah」</p>
<p>That’s a criteria that is so clear and annoying. They would heal and forgive us because it would be useful for their goal. If we had been weaker now, I would have been destroyed and deprived here.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, Trismegistus should nod his head without a hint.</p>
<p>I knew that they were no longer targeting us. But there were some things we didn’t know yet.</p>
<p>『In the end, what did you want to do?』</p>
<p>「That’s a good question. My goal is to create and defeat that huge antidemon.」</p>
<p>『Huh?』</p>
<p>「As a result, the Abyss Eater has greatly reduced its power. It is probably close to the completion of its mission given to me」</p>
<p>Seriously? Certainly, to create strong antidemons, the Abyss Eater would have to push itself too hard to focus on it. And if that special antidemon was easily defeated, it would mean that it had consumed a lot of power.</p>
<p>「Now that we had the key wielder of the failed divine sword and the strength to resist the antidemons, this was our greatest opportunity, but it seemed it worked out.」</p>
<p>『That’s why we had the chance to work with Merritte and Georg?』</p>
<p>「Indeed. Their work was truly magnificent.」</p>
<p>There was no emotion on Trismegistus’ face. No joy, no apologies, no anger, no anger.</p>
<p>Seeing him made me understand. This man is a doll that moves mechanically to accomplish the mission given to him by the Gods. To do so, he didn’t think he would use another person, or think that he was bad for it.</p>
<p>As she said, she acted to weaken the Abyss Eater and praised her collaborators as if she had achieved it.</p>
<p>Maybe Juanaverta was in charge of the conspiracy, while Trismegistus was just doing what he was told.</p>
<p>But even so, I couldn’t help but feel it.</p>
<p>『So many people have died, aren’t they?』</p>
<p>「That’s one of our goals too」</p>
<p>『You think your goal is to kill people......?』</p>
<p>Even though she understood that she shouldn’t make him an enemy, she could still feel the anger in her words.</p>
<p>「I’ve ordered him to leave a few times, but he remained in his place, so it was necessary.」</p>
<p>Trismegistus nodded casually at my question. The fact that I couldn’t feel any madness or malice from him made me understand that he was a ridiculous monster.</p>
<p>Now I understand what Isario meant by saying it was a monster.</p>
