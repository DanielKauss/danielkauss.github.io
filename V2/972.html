</div><h1>Chapter 972</h1><p>In order to stop the magic circle, I stowed away the evil crystals. Then the magic circle began to shine brighter than ever before. Why? No, it was just a booby wrap for when it was lifted? </p>
<p>『Fran! Let’s teleport!』</p>
<p>「Okay!」</p>
<p> We used teleport to escape the hole at once. Immediately after that, a huge explosion occurred at the bottom of the hole. Fran unleashed her flame magic just before the teleport to destroy the magic circle. A bright red flame swirled around the bottom, and countless sparks of fire rose to the edge of the hole. A bright red tempest swirled at the bottom, and countless sparks of fire rose to the edge of the hole.  However, the evil energy was still thicker than before. It seemed that the explosion did not destroy it.  A few seconds later, the black aura-like evil energy erupting from the hole suddenly disappeared. However, that didn’t mean the evil energy had disappeared.  Something that emitted powerful evil energy appeared in the hole. It looked down from the edge.  </p>
<p>「... Evil person?」</p>
<p>『Yeah, it looks like an evil person, just like a doll that twisted its evil energy into a humanoid. Its outline wavered and wavered, which seemed to be similar to a ghost.  As it was called a berserker, it raged like a trap until death when it was summoned. This must be a trap used to kill anyone who interfered with the activation of the magic circle.  Even so, I feel a strangely high killing intent or just a stubborn relentless feeling.Named the berserker, it seemed like a trap used to kill anyone who interfered with the magic circle’s activation.  But still, it had a strangely high killing intent.  I think it was just enough to lure in the antidemons, including the giants, and cause them to go on a rampage.  Moreover, even if the giant-type had destroyed the evil crystals and magic circle, the evil berserker that appeared would rampage around them. I could feel a kind of obsession for destroying the city at all costs.  </p>
<p>「Hooooooooourgh!」</p>
<p>「It’s mixed with evil in its voice」</p>
<p>『If we don’t do something, the others might get in danger.  So, we won’t blame them.  Let’s defeat them』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  The Ibilberserker was so dense with evil that just getting close to it was almost as if you were going to get sick. But it turned out to be a dead trap for an ordinary adventurer.  But the opponent was wrong.  </p>
<p>『Let’s make a hedgehog before we leave the hole!』</p>
<p>  I transformed my decorative string to create countless spears. Moreover, I attacked the Ibilberserker from all directions so that there was no gap between them.  Moreover, Fran continued to unleash her thunder magic from above. It may not be an opponent that was effective against paralysis, but her movements were dulled by the series of magic blows.  In the end, she couldn’t even try to avoid them, and her entire body was pierced by the spear I had created. However, as long as it was not a normal lifeform, that was not enough to cause a fatal wound.  The feeling coming from the spear was as if it had pierced through either a bubble or a bran. It was only a little touch thanks to its magical power, but if it hadn’t been for that, it would have just slipped through.  Well, this was also within my grasp. In the first place, I didn’t dare to activate the Evil Crusher so that I could defeat it with a single blow.  I used my Evil Domination to absorb the Evil Spirit of the Evil God.  I was able to do it quite well, probably because I was getting used to the skills. As long as his body was made up of Evil Spirits, Evil Spirit Absorption was a fatal ability for him.  The Evil Gods, who were trying to escape by slipping through the spear, stopped and shouted in agony.The evil energy cloaking her body quickly died off and disappeared in less than a minute.  </p>
<p>『Even though it was as evil as it was, it only healed about 500 of its magic power』</p>
<p>  It seemed to be inefficient to convert evil energy into magic power.  However, it was a great harvest to know that we could suck it out of fiends. After confirming the complete disappearance of evil energy from the magic circle, we decided to return to the main force.  When we reported on the evil crystals and the magic circle, they looked concerned. This was probably because it was more likely that the Dragon King was involved in this anomaly. The other adventurers had also come back, but they still couldn’t find any survivors.  Both Isario and Hilt decided to conclude that the residents had been annihilated by antidemons. The second unit decided to round out the investigation and head for the nearest town from here.  It was to replenish our supplies and share information. A day after our departure, we sensed a large number of people gathered around us as we arrived at the town.  </p>
<p>(Hmm.  There’s something there......!)</p>
<p>『There’s a human presence!  There’s quite a few of them!』</p>
<p>  Maybe some kind of army?  They were quite slow if they were to do so. They seemed to be heading in the same direction as us, but the speed was as if the civilians were mixed in. </p>
<p>「Miss Hilt...  can I ask them to confirm who you are?」</p>
<p>「Okay.」</p>
<p>「Maybe it’ll be a battle, so take a few fast-footed men with you.」</p>
<p>  Isario and the others noticed the group in front and sent Fran and a few others to scout out. A scout-type adventurer was selected from among the adventurers and left with Fran.  If things were to get worse, Fran would lure the enemies and have the adventurers run to Isario’s side. That was what I had in mind, but they were not our enemies.  There were adventurers and soldiers, but the vast majority of them were ordinary people, just like we had felt at first.  There were probably over a thousand of them. Urushi also had them hide in the shadows to approach Fran as little as possible.  The adventurers who had seen us relaxed when they knew that they were children. Adventurers, who seemed to be the leader of the group, called out to us from a distance.  </p>
<p>「You came from the town of Sende, huh? If so, do you know what happened to the huge antidemons in that town?」</p>
<p>「Nn!  We’ve defeated them」</p>
<p>「Eh?  W-What do you mean...?  By the number of people...?」</p>
<p>「Who are you guys?」</p>
<p>「A-Aah, yes.  We’re residents of the town of Sende.  We’re in the middle of evacuating......」</p>
<p> The town was destroyed, but there were apparently some residents who had survived. We explained that we were coming with an army and decided to move with them to a town beyond here. </p>
<p>『I hope this town is still safe...』</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p> But our hopes were met with disappointment, and as we continued forward, we saw a town that had been destroyed by giant antidemons, just like the Sante. </p>
<p>(Here, too, there are giant-types......!)</p>
<p>  It seems that even a town four or five times the size of a sate has no way for that huge body to survive.  </p>
<p>「A-ah...  The town of Sholts is......」</p>
<p>  The sight of the neighboring town finally arriving being destroyed by the giant-type stopped the refugees from the sate.  Some of them knelt and sobbed.</p>
<p>『I hope the town a little further down the road is still safe......』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p> But our wishes were met with disappointment, and as we continued on, we saw the town that had been destroyed by the giant antidemons, just like the ones we had seen on the stage. </p>
<p>(Here, too, there are giant-types......!)</p>
<p> It seems that even a town four or five times the size of a sate has no way for that huge body to survive. </p>
<p>「A-ah... The town of Sholts is......」</p>
<p> The sight of the neighboring town finally arriving being destroyed by the giant-type stopped the refugees from the sate. Some of them knelt and sobbed. Their hearts must have been broken and they despaired.</p>
