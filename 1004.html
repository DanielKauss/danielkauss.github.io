</div><h1>Chapter 1004</h1><p>A band of flames gushed out from the entrance to the nuclear facility. It looked like a super-sized flamethrower. It seemed that Isario had performed a large-scale fire attack between the nuclear facilities. A large amount of flames, which had not been contained in the small room, must have escaped and erupted into the passageway. A figure jumped out of the flames a moment later. The person who was rolling on the ground was definitely Isario. He rolled on the ground several times as if he had evaded the attack. He rolled on the ground several times as if he had evaded the attack.  No, in fact, he must have evaded the attack. As if chasing after Isario, a figure came out through the fire that was still engulfing him.  It wasn’t Merritte.  It was an antidemon.  Where did it come from?  It looked like a larger swordsman-type.  He was about two meters tall, but his whole body was bright red and his horns were gold. I had never seen those before.  And the magic and evil contained in it was so overwhelming that it made me tremble.  It was far beyond the size of a giant. It would not be an exaggeration to say that it was the strongest antidemon I’ve ever seen.  Its eyes turned to us, a few dozen meters away.  We entered the middle of it. If she moved badly, that alone was dangerous.  That’s how strong she was.  </p>
<p>『This makes it difficult for us to escape......』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>  Should we fight?  Or do we run as hard as we can? Isario shouted to Fran, who had hesitated and stopped.  </p>
<p>「Don’t let the dragonkin girls escape!  I’ll hold them back!」</p>
<p>  Isario’s face was definitely filled with panic. This red-golden antidemon was so troublesome that he had to give them such an expression.  Isario shouted and emitted murderous intent, trying to draw the antidemons’ attention. However, the antidemons’ eyes remained fixed on us.  Rather, he was staring at Velmeria and Frederick. </p>
<p>「You’re coming this way!」</p>
<p>「Gwooorgh!」</p>
<p>  Isario’s flames of impeding the antidemons, but the only way he could erase them with a single swing was to blow them off.  No matter how Isario is, it must be hard for him to take on them. It must be very difficult to win against them without releasing the divine sword.  </p>
<p>「Urushi!  Let them all go!」</p>
<p>『Fran! Are you going to fight!?』</p>
<p>「Isario has released his divine sword many times already.  It would be dangerous if he couldn’t push himself any further.」</p>
<p>『Well, that’s true, but...  Aah, it’s already!  We have no choice! Urushi, take Velmeria and Frederick to the upper floors!』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  The antidemons packed into us at once, probably sensing that we were about to escape. They were fast, but they were not so fast as to lose sight of us.  Fran’s parrying and my telekinesis managed to block the antidemon’s attack. There was no way I could expose such an opening in front of an S-ranked adventurer. </p>
<p>「Let’s ignore it!」</p>
<p>「Guggaaah!」</p>
<p>  Ignis slashed at them, and the antidemons were sent flying right next to them. It was a threat to not be badly injured by the slashes of the Divine Sword, but I guess it can’t be done without damage.  I’m watching over Isario as expected.  In the meantime, Urushi increased his speed and quickly became a legion. If he could distance himself from us this far, he wouldn’t be able to catch up with us anymore. </p>
<p>「What is Trismegistus and the girl?」</p>
<p>「I don’t know who’s Trismegistus, but he didn’t move.  He decided to stay put.  The robe bastard――He’s coming」</p>
<p>  With Isario’s words, a new figure appeared from the passageway. It was Merritte, the girl in a robe.  </p>
<p>「...... Did you let them go?」</p>
<p>  She was staring in a hateful way in the direction Urushi had run away.  </p>
<p>「Are you disappointed? The dragonkin girls are far farther away from here.」</p>
<p>「You did.  But that’s fine. I wished they would die miserably here, but it’s the same as killing them in the end」</p>
<p>「Hou? What are you planning to do?」</p>
<p>「You think I’ll tell you?」</p>
<p>「Well then?  Could you sneak a word to the poor uncle, who’s been in pain lately? I don’t even know your name yet.」</p>
<p>「Hmph.  Okay.  I’ll tell you before I kill you.  My name is Merritte Wisteria, and I’m the descendant of the pitiful kin who was destroyed by stupid dragonkin and exiled from this continent!  And those who were robbed of their families by the dragonkin! My only goal is to eradicate the evil dragonkin and those who have no value for their existence, and to avenge their ancestors and families!」</p>
<p>After giving a scowl at Isario’s words, Meritte cheerfully shouted out her name and purpose.  </p>
<p>「Avenger?」</p>
<p>「Want to warn them that no revenge will be given, or that it’s just empty?」</p>
<p>「I’m not someone who can do that.  But I don’t want to stop those who are trying to take revenge.  I just thought it was too much trouble.」</p>
<p> As she continued the conversation, Isario did not look away from the antidemons.  </p>
<p>「Mertorite-san.  Can you control the antidemons? In fact, it looked like an antidemon was created from a nucleus.」</p>
<p>「Yes, that’s right.」</p>
<p>  Meritte nodded strongly, as if he had no intention of hiding it after all. It seems that the red-golden antidemons were specially made from nuclear weapons.  </p>
<p>「Huh?  How?」</p>
<p>「Do you think you’ll teach me?」</p>
<p> They probably didn’t look like Isario. But to me, they looked faint like the evil threads that bind Meritte’s cross-shaped magic sword and the red-golden antidemons.  The cross-shaped magic sword was capable of manipulating evil spirits, and Wisteria’s evil spirit leads, which act on evil spirits as well. Perhaps they are combined to interfere with the nucleus of the Abyss Eater. Immediately after Meritte muttered these words, the antidemons began to move as if they were bouncing. Their target was Isario.  First, they were trying to defeat our strong enemy, Isario. In other words, they thought that Fran could handle Meritte by herself.  But it was something that had been mocked.  </p>
<p>『Fran.</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
