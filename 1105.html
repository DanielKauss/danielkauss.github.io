</div><h1>Chapter 1105</h1><p>When we arrived at the top of the wall, the situation had undergone a sudden change.</p>
<p>I saw some undead on top of the walls. And more than one of them.</p>
<p>Apparently, ghouls with long claws climbed up the wall. They probably didn’t notice it because of the darkness.</p>
<p>They were not very strong opponents, but they seemed to have a unique advantage in the darkness. Moreover, there were some low-ranked adventurers and young soldiers who were dealing with them.</p>
<p>(Master!)</p>
<p>『Yeah! Let’s take care of that one first!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Fran went into the middle of the adventurers and wiped out the rampaging ghouls in an instant. Apparently, they were no longer special individuals.</p>
<p>The surrounding adventurers froze at the appearance of the girl who quickly cut down the four ghouls. However, soon enough, cheers erupted.</p>
<p>『Fran, let’s keep kicking the undead out loud and raise morale even more』</p>
<p>「Okay」</p>
<p>『Urushi, find any people around you』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>But before we can do that, we need to check with Elevent.</p>
<p>「Who are the necromancers over here?」</p>
<p>「I’ve lowered it now! The top and bottom of the wall are all undead enemies!」</p>
<p>『Alright! Then it’s safe to unleash it so flashy!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Urushi’s Bottomless Shadow would be very effective if he was just going to handle the undead that were gathered under the walls.</p>
<p>It was able to defeat a wide area of undead without any damage to the city walls. All of them were low-ranked zombies by the looks of it, so I couldn’t expect to find any magic stones from them.</p>
<p>But above all, it was now nighttime. It was the time when dark magic was at its most powerful. Now, I might be able to gather hundreds of them and swallow them all in the shadows.</p>
<p>But there was one problem.</p>
<p>They were very unobtrusive. Even if we cast a spell to swallow an enemy at night when we had poor vision, no one would know what was going on.</p>
<p>That would not boost morale.</p>
<p>In that case, the adventurers would be more excited if the beautiful girl were to flick away their enemies with flashy attacks.</p>
<p>『But first, let’s go see the huge fireworks!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Fran and I jumped out of the walls into the air and casted our spells at the undead below us.</p>
<p>It was the multiple activations of the Flare Explosion Flare Magic. It was an aggressive technique that could attack a wide area.</p>
<p>The huge explosion chained together, blowing the surrounding spirits to pieces. Some of them were burning like torches, collapsing and collapsing against their friends to further expand the damage.</p>
<p>The adventurers were all cheering loudly.</p>
<p>『Next up is the Purification Magic!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>A pure white light expanded out at once, eroding the darkness of the night. The undead that had touched the light then crumbled away one after another.</p>
<p>With a weaker effect, this spell would only have the effect of dissipating the undead, but the story would change when we, who have high magic power, can use it. It will be a powerful anti-dead magic that cleanses the undead.</p>
<p>As we leapt around the perimeter of the city walls in the air, we emitted a white light and the undead were wiped out in no time at all.</p>
<p>Although the darkness had covered the entire area now, there were probably scattered undead-like remnants of sand around the walls.</p>
<p>Shouldn’t we have to clean up tomorrow? Should I ask the adventurers for help? That would surely reduce the morale I’ve boosted.</p>
<p>『Urushi, how is it?』</p>
<p>(Woof woof!)</p>
<p>『Did you find it!? I’m going now!』</p>
<p>To our surprise, Urushi had spotted a suspicious person. We headed there as if we had been captured.</p>
<p>On a small hill about a kilometer away from Alessa, a man who had been swallowed half by the darkness was being captured with a limp look on his face. He must have run out of spirit because he tried to escape.</p>
<p>It’s not a bottomless shadow, but a capture technique called Shadow Bind.</p>
<p>「Urushi, this guy is one?」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>「!! B-But who is she!?」</p>
<p>The man looked at us with a frightened look.</p>
<p>「That’s my line. Who are you?」</p>
<p>「I-I’m an adventurer. This is a message to let you know what’s going on in the north. If I was heading to Alessa, all this is going to happen......」</p>
<p>「Hmm」</p>
<p>「Is this wolf your servant? I’m begging you, can you release the restraints?」</p>
<p>He then bowed his head to Fran pleadingly. Looking at him like this, it was no wonder he looked like a pitiful adventurer who had been captured by accident.</p>
<p>But it still smelled bad. That’s what Fran thought of it.</p>
<p>「Then take out your adventurer’s card」</p>
<p>「Eh? No, I didn’t have it with me right now...」</p>
<p>「Then how did you plan to prove your identity in Alessa?」</p>
<p>「Y-Yeah, he’s registered, and his name and face would be known if he was Alessa」</p>
<p>「...? I’ve never seen you before?」</p>
<p>「Uwaah, about that...」</p>
<p>「Are you really Alessa’s adventurer?」</p>
<p>「That’s right!」</p>
<p>「Then why don’t you know me?」</p>
<p>「...Kuh」</p>
<p>He’s about to fell apart! Apparently, he didn’t have much knowledge about adventurers, so he couldn’t disguise himself. Anyone related to intelligence must have done some research, but this man was clearly a normal soldier.</p>
<p>He was probably just acting like a scout in a hurry.</p>
<p>However, that meant that there was a possibility that there was a certain group of people hidden around here who wanted to know what was going on in the area.</p>
<p>So what should we do about this guy now? The best thing to do would be to take him back to town and interrogate him. However, that might help us escape to any enemy troops that might have entered the area.</p>
<p>If that was the case, it was quick to get him to talk right here. Let’s do a quick check before leaving it to Urushi’s confess poison. With that, the other party would be stuck for a while, and he looks like he’ll be talking for sure.</p>
<p>『We don’t have any choice. Let’s ask her a few questions』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「W-Why are you raising your sword? I-I’m your friend!」</p>
