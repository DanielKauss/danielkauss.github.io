</div><h1>Chapter 1134</h1><p>「Ionez-sama!」</p>
<p>「You little ones!」</p>
<p> After defeating Ionez, the vice-leader of the Zhu Flame Knights, the red knights around us emitted killing intent. However, the red knights who lost their commander were clearly disrupting their coordination. And it wasn’t Fran and Urushi who escaped from there. Fran and Urushi were still bewildered after Forrund was freed from Ionez, the vice-leader of the group, and my secret magic shattered the red knights without a trace. Fran and Urushi were still bewildered after being freed from Ionez, the vice-commander of the group, and my secret magic wiped out the red knights. And my secret magic wiped out the red knights as well.  As the pressure on the red knights decreased, it would have a positive effect on the rest of the world.  The adventurers who had been on the offensive against the undead were even more free, and if the undead’s attention was diverted, the nobles had more time to rebuild their legion. The war situation then turned to the advantage of the Kranzel Kingdom at once.  However, the Raidos Kingdom was not just watching over them.  After killing about 30 red knights, they must have judged it impossible to rebuild. A trump card sounded from the fort.  It seemed to have been a signal of retreat, and the red knights formed a formation and began to descend to the fort. Normally this would have been a good chance for them to take us by surprise, but they unleashed flame magic from the fort and the knights. The barrage had blocked the adventurers, so they couldn’t chase after us.  However, now that the battle was no longer a disorderly brawl, it was easier for us to fight. No longer had to worry about involving our friends, and we could unleash our magic without any worries.  </p>
<p>『Fran!  Urushi! Let’s do it!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>『Ekato Keraunos!』</p>
<p>「Thunder Bolt!」</p>
<p>「Aooooh!」</p>
<p>  The red knights rained down on us as Fran and I retreated from their Thunderbolt Magic and Urushi’s Dark Magic.  However, their attacks did not defeat the soldiers. Some kind of barrier was deployed around the troops to block their magic.  But this was expected from us as well.  In a world where there are strong people, a large unit is not only advantageous. Even if there is one magician who is more capable than expected, they will suffer a great deal of damage.  Therefore, it was inevitable that the equipment and techniques to prevent it were being researched in various countries.  Even at the sea, magic could be blocked in the same way. The Kingdom of Kranzel had similar equipment, and it was only natural that there would be more powerful magical tools and magic circles on the battlefield of Raidos.  Or rather, we had heard information about that from Avenger. As a fort that defends an important base, it seemed to be equipped with both physical and magical defense barriers.  However, it required a lot of magic power to use it at the same time, and the simultaneous deployment would be limited to about half an hour. Now that the battle was already prolonged, they would only have enough magic to use the magic defense barrier for a short time.  We’ll keep firing our spells in rapid succession and let them use the magic defense barrier. Then, Forrund was ready.  </p>
<p>『Can we go soon?』</p>
<p>(Yeah.  I’ll leave it to you!)</p>
<p> Forrund nodded enthusiastically.  </p>
<p>『Fran!  Urushi! Let’s do this flashy in the end!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「Woooof!」</p>
<p>  In order for us to keep using the magic defense barrier, we released a spell that I didn’t know how many times already. As we had aimed for, the magic was blocked by the barrier.  Meanwhile, Forrund stepped forward and held his right hand up to the sky. As he moved, the Forrund’s magic sword, which the surrounding adventurers had possessed, disappeared as if dissolving into the void.  The strengthening of the magic sword would no longer be there, but it was protected by the white magic power that Donadrond seemed to be using right now. Even without Forrund’s sword, he would not fall into an immediate disadvantage.  I could see that an enormous amount of magic power was returned to Forrund. Apparently, magic power was used to materialize and maintain it, and when it was broken, the magic power that made up the sword was recovered.  </p>
<p>「My flesh and blood, Swords, cut through. Ten Thousand Blades」</p>
<p>  As usual, Forrund was a quiet voice, but his mutterings were clearly heard.  I guess the power contained in his words gave him a presence. In the next moment, countless swords gushing out of the thin air were swung down toward the ground, as if they had been swung by an invisible arm.  Moreover, he did not attack just randomly. All of the more than a hundred slashes were aimed at the knights.  Many of the slashes had been slammed down the necks of the red knights as if they were a guild blade. Most of the attacks that were dodged also inflicted deep wounds on the knights.  Moreover, each one of them was a magic sword with special powers. It even had additional effects, such as burning wounds, turning them into poison, and paralyzing them with lightning.  It was a terrifying attack.  It was vicious power, even against large armies and one-on-one.  </p>
<p>『Yosh! Now we can deal with the undead without worrying about the back!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「Yeah.」</p>
<p> They may still have troops in the fort, but if the strongest unit, the Red Knight, is destroyed, they will be able to deploy instantly.  </p>
<p>『Forrund, hang in there a little longer!』</p>
<p>(Don’t worry.)</p>
<p>  In fact, Forrund has already used up most of his magic power. After all, his attacks and the backlash are probably great.  However, if he falls down from the distance, it will be realized that Forrund’s attacks could no longer be unleashed. That would not be a deterrent. So, the plan was to have him work a little harder so that he could ride on Urushi and evacuate from the battlefield.</p>
<p>『Yeah, I’m on it!』</p>
