</div><h1>Chapter 1023</h1><p>As the hydrangea pulled out Berserk, a moan leaked out from General Hagane’s soldiers. I thought they were afraid of getting caught in the middle of it, but that didn’t seem to be the case.</p>
<p>There was clear sadness and frustration on their faces.</p>
<p>「Not only is it not worth my while...」</p>
<p>「Even the Hydrangea Princess-sama is here...」</p>
<p>I guess the hydrangea was saddened to use Berserk and sacrifice himself. After all, the soldiers of General Hagane seemed to care about the Berserk’s wielder.</p>
<p>He seemed to have a lot of respect and affection for Fran rather than just being a superior.</p>
<p>Fran looked like she had stopped the hydrangea, but she didn’t talk about her feelings. At the moment, if she had to rely on her, it would be difficult to put an end to the giant antidemons.</p>
<p>And the wielder of the Divine Sword had made up their minds. Fran couldn’t let that sentiment slide. She was standing there, holding her fist so tightly that it made her blood gush.</p>
<p>「Fran」</p>
<p>「Hydrangea」</p>
<p>The girls’ gazes intertwined. They stared at each other for a few seconds. But then things moved much in that few seconds.</p>
<p>「Wait. Berserk girl, you won’t have to sacrifice anymore.」</p>
<p>The owner of the voice was the Demon Lord Jayne.</p>
<p>「? What do you mean?」</p>
<p>「It is the job of an adult to risk their lives at a time like this」</p>
<p>Jayne quickly stood in front of the girl and stopped the hydrangea with a serious look on her face. However, the hydrangea shook her head and tried to step forward.</p>
<p>「That antidemon is starting to regenerate. We don’t have much time」</p>
<p>Like she said, the body of the giant antidemon was visibly starting to heal. We couldn’t let it stand any longer.</p>
<p>Still, Jayne did not retreat.</p>
<p>「You don’t have to worry. You don’t even have to attack――」</p>
<p>She’s like a baby!</p>
<p>As if to agree with Jayne’s words, a huge explosion broke out on the surface of the antidemon’s body. The explosion burned its body and turned the regenerating part into ashes.</p>
<p>It was clearly not normal magic. It was probably the work of a figure in the sky.</p>
<p>「Us demonkin and other adults. And that guy will do his best」</p>
<p>「That is...... Isario!」</p>
<p>Just as Fran had shouted, the identity of the person who had fired the explosion was Isario, who should have been missing. Her body was supported by a translucent, ghost-like object.</p>
<p>「Did Jayne find Isario?」</p>
<p>「That’s right――!」</p>
<p>Jayne, who had responded to Fran’s words, shook her hand lightly. Then, a dagger appeared as a magic bullet.</p>
<p>It flew at high speed and seemed to have returned to Jayne’s hand. It was a national treasured dagger, and said to be one of the proofs of the Demon Lord’s identity.</p>
<p>「This sword is the best catalyst for necromancy. I created a ghost that maximized my detection ability and the command ability of my underlings, searching for it under the rubble.」</p>
<p>I summoned an enhanced ghost with this dagger at its core and let it command a lot of ghosts. By doing so, they were able to create an Isario search party that could operate without any problems under the rubble.</p>
<p>Jayne was not very active in the battle because of her emphasis on that.</p>
<p>「But are you okay with Isario?」</p>
<p>「Well, I don’t think we’ll be able to fight for long, but we’ll be fine! After all, I’ll help you!」</p>
<p>Jayne exclaimed, holding up her dagger high. From there, magic power overflowed from the divine attribute.</p>
<p>「Atone for your death, celebrate your death with your death. We recognize your death, record your death, and make your life come true! Necronomi-con!」</p>
<p>The door opened in front of our astonished eyes.</p>
<p>「Divine Sword Release!」</p>
<p>A blueish-black light shone from the national treasure dagger, obliterating the vision of those around us. When the light subsided and everyone’s vision was restored, it was not even a weapon.</p>
<p>「A book?」</p>
<p>『Is that the Divine Sword? Well, I knew that it was a general name for super weapons that sometimes had no weapon form, but...』</p>
<p>Sophie’s oratorium was also in an instrument form. I never thought that a Divine Sword would still be hiding in this close range!</p>
<p>What was floating on top of it was a huge book with a metal cover. It was about a22-inch TV, wasn’t it? The silver cover was engraved similar to the dagger before it was released, showing something in common.</p>
<p>The aura of intimidation and Divine Power that overflowed makes it easy for anyone to believe that this was a Divine Sword.</p>
<p>The Divine Sword, or the necronomicon, that had been floating in mid-air, slid smoothly on Jayne’s hand. It was untouched and floated a few centimeters above her palm.</p>
<p>「Heroic spirit chapter, Item 7, Reproducible. Pride in defeat on seven battlefields, the seventh Demon Lord. One time he pulled out his sword, he lost seven heads, and fell seven castles. He fought seven days and seven nights in a row, defeating seven countries and defeating the great War King――」</p>
<p>Jayne’s words were matched with the pages being flipped around on their own. Then, something like small letters jumped out of the opened page into the void, then I lined up in a circle and drew something like a magic circle.</p>
<p>The magic circle emitted light, and something even greater sprang out of it.</p>
<p>It was a coffin.</p>
<p>It’s a very sumptuous and intimidating coffin made of stone, with engravings all over. No doubt that those who were buried inside were of a noble status.</p>
<p>As everyone watched with bated breath, the door to the coffin opened on its own. A mummy was placed in a narrower-than-expected coffin.</p>
<p>「Awaken, heroic spirit! We are our forerunners!」</p>
<p>『...It’s been a while since we’ve been on this battlefield』</p>
<p>She then smirked as she peeked through the bandages.</p>
<p>「That’s right. Beat that big monster together with us」</p>
<p>Fran’s continued the offensive, but not with her sword.</p>
<p>Judging from the name, he seemed to be Jayne’s ancestor, the same as the Tort on her necklace. However, the power was on a different level. Considering Morten as a magic beast, he could probably reach Threat Level A.</p>
<p>The bandage that had been wrapped around Mummy’s body turned into a grain of light and unraveled, becoming an armored kabuto that adorned Morten again. The magic power that adorned her body was devastating enough to never be passed on to enemies.</p>
<p>I had seen Tort gain physical body and fight, but he was much stronger than that.</p>
<p>「Please leave. Next up is the heroic spirit chapter, chapter――」</p>
<p>Moreover, Jayne summoned two more undead beasts with Dovey’s family name and sent them to the battlefield. All of them were very strong.</p>
<p>It seems Morten was a swordsman, and the newly called Diez and Maut were of various types, such as magician-types.</p>
<p>Does that mean it’s a Divine Sword that can use powerful undead?</p>
<p>Jayne briefly told us if she had noticed Fran’s questioning gaze.</p>
<p>「They are the successive generations of necronomicon users. And this is the result of them. Those who have made a contract with the necronomicon, the sword that led the demonkin, will become heroic spirits and continue to protect the demonkin even after their death」</p>
<p>Did the price of using it mean that they would continue to use it after Jayne died? Both Fran and I were shocked, but Jayne had no gloomy feelings for it.</p>
<p>「Ahahaha! You see, that was an amazing power, right?」</p>
<p>She seems to be saying that seriously. Maybe it was not something to avoid for her, a powerful necromancer.</p>
<p>「Come now! Ignis, oratorio, and necronomicon! The competition of three divine swords! Burn it to your eyes!」</p>
