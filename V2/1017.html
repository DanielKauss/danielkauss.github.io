</div><h1>Chapter 1017</h1><p>Adoru, who was already in the Divine Sword Release state, attacked the giant antidemons. As expected of a Divine Sword. Even though Adoru’s level was slightly down, its power was immense. The compressed Divine Power Blade, which stretched out from the Divine Sword, easily slashed at the legs of the giant antidemons. It was an overwhelming slash that made me wonder if I had sliced through the entire space. And it didn’t end there. After multiple slashes, both legs were slender, and its huge body was slammed down into the ground. Several slashes sliced both legs thin, and its huge body slammed down into the ground. It was an unrealistic sight, as if it had been cut down by a building.  However, the lost legs began to regenerate quickly. It was as if we were watching the process of tree seeds growing in an instant and growing into a great tree at a tremendous speed. It wouldn’t regenerate in an instant, but it wouldn’t take her thirty seconds for that super huge leg to return to its original state.  Adoll bit her teeth when she saw that. </p>
<p>「As long as they’re top-level antidemons, that’s until they disappear!」</p>
<p>  Certainly, she could defeat them if she made them disappear so that they couldn’t regenerate... Even a Divine Sword was capable of that? They were already huge and strong, but with the endless magical power coming from the Abyss Eater, their regenerative power and barriers were top-class.  </p>
<p>「Can you do it?」</p>
<p>「...... My sword is Silard’s most powerful divine sword! It’s easy to defeat an enemy of this level with your strongest move!」</p>
<p>  He said that as if he was telling himself the truth.  He may not be lying, but it seems he really didn’t mean it. It was as if he was trying to inspire himself to be like that.  But Adoru did not let his trump card go in front of him.  Suddenly, there were signs of a large number of people around the giant antidemons. Over a thousand armies suddenly appeared. In the center of it was a short female dwarve that gave off an intimidating aura that pierced her skin, as well as a demonkin woman clad in mana with the terrifying necromancy attribute.  </p>
<p>「Fuhahahaha!  Snorabbit army, here I am!」</p>
<p>「Ahahahaha!  Approaching the Demon Lord!  He’s very intelligent! I swear to refrain!」</p>
<p> The queens led the dwarves and demonkin.  Just like before, Jayne’s abilities must have been enough to hide the entire army.  So super-shield that even we would not be able to detect in the middle of a battle. Moreover, the Demon Lord and his entourage will show up.  This is much more troublesome than an army of tens of thousands. Considering that it was a large army or a nation against a whole, it would be much more dangerous than a single weak person.  Was it okay to expose this ability to the Holy Nation or Snorabbit? That country is dangerous, so I don’t think it would be surprising if they used logic to attack first.  I don’t know Orfalve and the other dwarves, but I don’t know how reliable the Holy Nation is...  Is it because they are so close that they don’t have to worry about being attacked? Or is there such a thing as having a trump card that it won’t matter if they teach us the stealth ability of the entire army?  Seeing the queen’s army, Adoll stopped attacking and licked her tongue lightly. As expected, she couldn’t attack with anything that would get caught in her way.  </p>
<p>「Go!」</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Yeah!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>  In front of us, the dwarves, strengthened by the demonkin’s support magic, began their attacks at once. They were targeting their right leg, which was still in the regeneration process.  </p>
<p>「Oiasaa!」</p>
<p>「Dorasaa!」</p>
<p> Despite her roar, the movements were perfectly regulated.  Dozens of dwarves were unleashing blows with the utmost magic power at the same time.  They unleashed dozens of powerful slashes at the same time, enough to take down even a giant tree with a single blow. Even against the giant antidemon’s barrier, those blows were easily broken through.  The shock of an explosion caused the antidemon’s armor to goug and fly away. Its regeneration began quickly, but before it could fully regenerate, the next attack was launched. The dwarves that had formed a five-row formation continued to strike with their all-out attacks, swapping their fronts one after another.  However, the giant antidemons were not just being defeated.  They simply extended their arms and slammed against the dwarves. Fran couldn’t help but let out a yelp, but the dwarves remained motionless.  </p>
<p>「Shield Brigade!」</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Yeah!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>  In response to the queen’s voice, the dwarves, who had been standing on their left and right, stepped forward.  Just like that, they held their large shields high above their heads. And at the same time, they shouted.  </p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Shield Saint Technique, Power Shield!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>  It was a spectacular sight.  They looked like a huge shield when they were densely packed together and activated their shield techniques at the same time. The dwarves’ mana shields catch the hands of the giant antidemons and repel them.  Apparently, the shield itself was a powerful magical tool, which had the effect of increasing the strength of the shield techniques.  Even so, they did not expect us to catch them, or even push them back. Moreover, they had even calculated the direction in which it would be repelled.  The giant antidemons whose arms were being deflected had lost their balance. Maybe they had too big a body to control them completely. This was just like the giants.  The combined forces of dwarves and demonkin exemplified the tremendous power of the group. But for some reason, the two queens looked bitter.  </p>
<p>「This is no good.」</p>
<p>「Yeah, I won’t lose at this rate.」</p>
<p>  To my surprise, weak words came out of their mouths.  </p>
<p>「Are you afraid you can’t?」</p>
<p>「Indeed.  No way.  Black Lightning Princess, you know it’s you, right?  Even that stupid regeneration doesn’t reduce your magic power. On the contrary, it’s still increasing right now, you know?」</p>
<p>「Shaving it little by little will be meaningless.  If we’re going to do it, we’ll have to take one hit after another」</p>
<p>「We can still hold it back for now, but we’ll run out of power eventually」</p>
<p>「I’ve never seen such a troublesome enemy in my life」</p>
<p>  I guess their conclusions were the same.  I was thinking about the same thing too.</p>
<p>「Shaving its power little by little will be meaningless, you know? If we’re going to do it, we’ll have to go all out one at a time」</p>
<p>「We’re still able to hold him back for now, but we’ll run out of strength eventually」</p>
<p>「I’ve never seen such a troublesome enemy in my life」</p>
<p> I guess their conclusions were the same. I was thinking about the same thing too. In the end, it would be impossible to defeat this guy unless we completely destroy his entire body so that he could not regenerate, as Adoll said.</p>
