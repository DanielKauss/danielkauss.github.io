</div><h1>Chapter 949</h1><p>「Is all of this time the name of the Divine Sword?」</p>
<p>「Original Sword, Alpha, Mad God Sword, Berserk, War Knight Sword, Chariot, Golden Dragon Sword, Eldrado, Earth Sword, Gaia, Brilliant Flame Sword, Ignis, Water Spirit Sword, Crystalus, Sanctuary, Roaring Storm Sword, Tempest, and Wisdom, the Wisdom Sword. It is only a guess by observation, but it is possible to teach you a certain level of ability」</p>
<p>「I want to know!」</p>
<p> It was the same for me! But I don’t have much time to talk right now.</p>
<p>「I want to know!」</p>
<p>  I’m one too!  But the situation has not changed much for now.  </p>
<p>『Fran, let’s go back to town first.  I want to hear what you have to say calmly.』</p>
<p>「Nn.  Can I enter the town?」</p>
<p>「No problem.」</p>
<p>  This continent was full of ex-criminals, and there’s no point in worrying about my status.  As long as I don’t feel any signs of antidemons, I can enter without any problem.  The antidemons seemed to have been completely exterminated, and I think Isario will be unusually tired. I’m not sure if he’s tired out because he’s an old man who was still covered in dirt. Maybe he was trying to show how strong he is, but since the Divine Sword Release was so short, he’s sure he’s better than Ader.  He was fighting on this continent for a long time and seemed to know how to fight to suppress his exhaustion.  </p>
<p>(Isario came this way)</p>
<p>  He seemed to have naturally captured Fran even at this distance. He was waving his hands with a flicker.  He doesn’t seem to care about us getting caught up in it. Well, it was probably because we were bad, and he didn’t think we were gonna die from it.  It seemed that there was no problem by himself, so we decided to go back without talking to him. Isario’s alone was important from the beginning to the end.  We returned to Brutori a little ahead of ourselves and headed straight for the inn.  I thought about talking at the bar, but it was gonna be longer. It would be better if it was in a place where there were no strange obstacles.  Fran offered the Silver Lady a chair and sat herself down on the bed. </p>
<p>「Tell me more about the Divine Sword」</p>
<p>「Understood」</p>
<p>  Fran asked a few questions as if she couldn’t wait. It would be quite rare to see such an excited expression only before a fight or a meal.  I know how she feels.  After all, we can hear firsthand from someone related to the Divine Level blacksmith about the Divine Sword. </p>
<p>「Let’s start by getting some information about the Blade of Origin, Alpha.」</p>
<p>「Nn.  Please.」</p>
<p> It’s Alpha that we can turn against. We want to know as much as possible about it.  </p>
<p>「The Divine Sword, Alpha, is currently managed by the Holy Nation of Silard. Its wielder is called the Divine Sword Knight, and it is replaced every five to ten years or so」</p>
<p>「Is it that short?」</p>
<p>  5 to ten years... That’s not something a normal Divine Sword wielder would lose so much.  In their long history, they might not be unbreakable. However, it would be impossible for the Divine Sword Knight to be defeated every 10 years.  If such a dangerous being ever happens to appear, it would be a crisis for a country, or rather, for the world.  </p>
<p>「The use of the Divine Sword has a high price to pay for each. </p>
<p>「Yes. All Divine Swords have a price and a restriction」</p>
<p>  The Silver Lady’s explanation was very understandable.  The Divine Sword was a super weapon that could change the terrain and kill large numbers of people in a short period of time. If it was used multiple times for personal interests and self-interest, it would be more dangerous than an Evil God.  That was why there were various restrictions.  The first restriction was the upper limit of the number of existence.  There was a maximum of 26 of them set by the Gods. Moreover, even a Divine level blacksmith cannot create such a thing.  The second restriction is the choice of the wielder.  Not only can anyone handle it, but only those who meet the requirements can be equipped.  In many cases, the Divine Sword itself chooses the wielder.  </p>
<p>「What are the Alpha restrictions?」</p>
<p>「To use the Blade of Origin, Alpha, you must be recognized as an wielder by a pair of special magical tools. Apparently, it is currently controlled by the Silard King.」</p>
<p>  If the Royal Family of Silard can choose the wielder, then that would work for the sake of the country.  But Adar is not like a royalty. So, she went out of her way to choose commoners? </p>
<p>「The condition for becoming an Alpha wielder is that they are not related to the person you choose.  They also have a high level of education in some skills」</p>
<p>「No blood relation?  That’s not the case?」</p>
<p>「Yes.  There should be no blood connection. However, it is said that Silard nobles have complicated bloodline and most of them are related to each other.」</p>
<p>  That was probably why they chose the commoners after their brainwashing. Judging by the high level of consciousness among the holy knights, it was unnatural for Silard nobles to give their power to the commoners.  The third restriction was the price the wielder would have to pay. In some cases, they might even die, but there was a heavy price to pay.  </p>
<p>「The price for Alpha is the inability to gain experience and a decrease in level.」</p>
<p>「...... Do you want to use it to lower your level?」</p>
<p>「Yes.  During the opening, you will not be able to gain experience, so it is known that your level will gradually decrease.  The duration depends on your original level.  It is said that some knights used their divine swords for half a day or so when the pieces of the Evil Gods resurrected in the northern continent. I guess it’s only a matter of time before you level down 1 level in 10 minutes.」</p>
<p>  Six levels for an hour, and 72 levels for 12 hours.  That’s half a day’s work. So, the original level meant that they could be active for a long time.  Moreover, the price of lowering that level was a trap.  If the level was too low after use, the backlash of using the Divine Sword would come all at once.  The backlash was not a price, in other words, the physical damage and exhaustion from forcibly pushing power beyond a person.  The backlash of using the Divine Sword was so intense that even ordinary people could not withstand it. Judging from how weak Adoll was, it was understandable that he would have been dangerous if he had been a little weaker.Judging by how weak he was, it was understandable that he would have been in danger.  Considering the safety margin, if he wasn’t around 25~30 level, he might have died from the backlash.  </p>
<p>「What is known from Alpha’s performance is a significant increase in physical ability.  However, as the level continues to drop, its effect will also decrease」</p>
<p>「I see」</p>
<p> The more you use it, the more your status will keep decreasing.  </p>
<p>「Moreover, the greater the skill.  However, this power does not cause evolution. However, there are skills that are given to the wielder when they are released, and they are sure to become that skilled.」</p>
<p>「Sword King Technique, Sword King Technique, Physical Manipulation, Divine Power Control, instant regeneration, Abnormal Status Nullification, Air Way」</p>
<p>「Sword King Technique!」</p>
<p>  So, I wondered how much sword skills he had acquired. Even if his swordsmanship was at the highest level, it was strange for him to become that skilled.  His physical abilities increased ten times, Sword King Technique was given, and the other skills were maximized.  He was just as strong as normal. But the price would be too high.  </p>
<p>『Low level, huh...?』</p>
<p>  A divine sword that gets weaker as he continued to fight and defeat his enemies. It would be very scary to replace it with her own.  Fran thought about the time she used it. She frowned slightly.  </p>
<p>(I guess Master is the best, not with Alpha.)</p>
<p>『Hahaha.</p>
<p>『Hahaha. You’re kinda embarrassed, aren’t you?』</p>
