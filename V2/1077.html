</div><h1>Chapter 1077</h1><p>Satia’s interrogation――No, torture was terrible. To be honest, if she had a stomach, she might have returned it. Fran and Urushi can be looked at as normal. The agent’s man certainly had pain nullification, so he didn’t feel any pain. But it was not that he didn’t feel any pain. Rather than the pain itself, he felt the slowly melting of his arms and legs, and the fear of being directly patted by his brain and heart. He was afraid that his stomach would be cut open and his body would be filled with small insects. The fear of having his stomach cut open and his body filled with small insects.  Satia was mentally cornered with various fears. The way the expressionless-looking man’s face gradually contorted in fear was so sympathetic that she forgot that he was the one who had killed Fran.  No matter how bad he was, the torture did not end there because Satia would regenerate him.  The arms that had been melted earlier were now gradually cut down into pieces, their bones were visible. Then they were regenerated again, and the next time they were swallowed by the tentacles.  For a man, this must be a nightmare.  However, the man still did not open his mouth.  He was impressed when he had gone this far, but Satia was not in a hurry. But Satia was not in a hurry.  In fact, she must have expected the man to endure it.  </p>
<p>「You’ll endure it well, aren’t you?  But can you withstand this even with your heart weakened?」</p>
<p>「...!」</p>
<p>  Ronowe grabbed the man’s torso and lifted it. It was quite weak because of Fran’s slash, but it seemed that it was fine enough for him to show up and wield some power.  The man didn’t even scream when he had the huge demon’s mouth in front of him. On the contrary, he even glared at Ronowe and said that he would never give up.  A gray smoke was sprayed from Ronowe’s mouth on such a man.  </p>
<p>「Guh...」</p>
<p>  Poison, huh? After multiple blows, the man’s appearance gradually changed.  When I appraised the man, I found that he had multiple status abnormalities, including daze, confusion, and self-destruction. He must have used poisons of various effects at the same time.  </p>
<p>「Aah...  Ah...」</p>
<p>  His emotions flowed from the man’s face and he began to stare into the void in disbelief. Satia, who had confirmed this, asked the man a question.  </p>
<p>「What is your name?」</p>
<p>「...Drick Weston」</p>
<p>  He answered honestly!  It seems that he had multiple status anomalies and was in a state ofconfessing. This was amazing, although it was not the name in the appraisal...  No, it quickly changed its name to Dirk Weston.  There were also a few more skills. In addition to the Appraisal Disguising, the effect of the Information Cloaking skill seemed to have fooled the information in the appraisal.  I see.  So, you made it look like it didn’t matter, and you were hiding the important part. This must be the same as how we’re using Appraisal Jammer and Appraisal Impersonation.  Satya looked at her lightly when she heard her name.  </p>
<p>「I never thought I’d see this man in Weston?  I never thought I’d meet him in a place like this」</p>
<p>「He’s a celebrity?」</p>
<p>「Yes.  No one in the upper echelons of our country knows this, and he’s probably the head of the Intelligence Department of the Western Duke. In other words, he was the pocket sword of the Western Duke」</p>
<p>  Oi oi!  No way!  This was no big deal!  He had heard only the name from the operatives he had interrogated in the past. However, he didn’t know anything about his face or age, and was apparently known as a legendary operative who walked alone with only his name. He was only a B-ranked adventurer in terms of combat power, but his skills as a operative were quite impressive.  He could change his name and face with disguise, appraisal, and illusion magic, and then turn into someone else with his Acting and play skills. They could infiltrate enemy areas, transfer, trap set up, and perform various other operations with fraud skills.  They also had high stealth and concealment abilities.  Well, they wouldn’t be able to catch us even if we looked for them normally.  </p>
<p>「Urushi, get the credit!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「What is your purpose?」</p>
<p>「Knight of Demon...」</p>
<p>「What do you mean?  Please explain」</p>
<p>「Yes...」</p>
<p>  The hypnosis Dirk spoke with a stunned expression on his face.  There were several reasons why they used the villages of the Kranzel Kingdom to curse. As Satia had expected, they were also aiming to weaken Philias with the curse and gain a body from the demon knights that came to stop the curse.  However, their main goal was to kill the demon knights and obtain their bodies. Because they were given forces and skills, the Western Duke was unable to offset their demands.  Dirk’s miscalculations show that his strong enemies, Frut and Satia, have appeared.Their mistake would have been the appearance of their strong enemies, Frut and Satia.  With the pressure from the north and the sea on Philias, they did not expect royalty, who was a very important force, to travel to the continent.  </p>
<p>「I was originally in the defensive side of the sea, but because Raydoss’s fleet has disappeared」</p>
<p>  Our rampage in Barbra and Dars had apparently caused a breakdown in their plans. No, Fran’s visit to Metermum in the first place was probably the most miscalculations.  After seeing Fran at a glance, Diaz realized that he would never win.  Then he switched his goal to Fran’s assassination.  </p>
<p>「Diazbolos knows that only men among the royalty can inherit. If he can kill the prince here, even if his strategy is unsuccessful, he will be fine.」</p>
<p>「!  I can’t believe that it has been discovered......  Ah!  F-Fran-san!  N-Do what you didn’t hear before......!」</p>
<p>「Nn. Okay, thank you very much.」</p>
<p> Only the royalty can inherit the man...... So that’s why they chose Fran as their target, huh?  Later, Dirk tried to escape and was captured by Urushi.  He seemed to be confident in his escape, but it seems that Urushi’s ability to track them outweighed his. Well, in fact, he had been away for a few hours, and if it hadn’t been for Urushi, he would have escaped. Fran stroked Urushi again. </p>
<p>「Urushi, good」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  After that, we learned a lot of things about the plans and internal affairs of the Western Duke. With this information, we would be able to gain an advantage over the Western Duke.  </p>
<p>「Hey, I have a question for you」</p>
<p>「Please do」</p>
<p>「... Black slaves are sent to the Raidos Kingdom from the west side of the Kranzel Kingdom.  Are you buying from the Western Duke?」</p>
<p>「That’s right」</p>
<p>「...Why are you buying the illegal slaves?」</p>
<p>  Fran apparently wanted to know about the illegal slaves.  If she wasn’t careful, she might have been sent to the Raidos Kingdom too. She was probably curious about that.  </p>
<p>「Soldiers, miners, farmers, servants.  There are as many ways for adults to use them as they want. They send children to the north.」</p>
<p>「The north?」</p>
<p>「The northern Duke buys children. I don’t know what he’s using it for, but unpopular races such as the black cats and fishmen can sell at high prices.」</p>
<p>「The Northern Duke......」</p>
<p>  He’s one of the Dukes of Raydoss.  So he’s probably not using it for anything.  It was at the moment when the name of the Northern Duke was engraved on Fran’s murder list. </p>
<p>「Old people and injured people who have no way of using it are used as sacrifices」</p>
<p>「Sacrificing?」</p>
<p>  Fran’s mutterings exuded killing intent. However, Dirk continued to tell the truth.  </p>
<p>「When making a knife to kill demons, it is a sacrifice to remove magic power and curses. They will need more than a hundred people to make one, so they need as many slaves as they can.」</p>
<p>「......!」</p>
<p>『Fran!  Wait!  You’ll die if you punch them! We’ll have to save you as a valuable witness!』</p>
<p>「...!」</p>
<p>  Fran swung down a nearby tree to spit out her placeless anger. With a fierce impact, her trunk broke and her hands were covered in blood.  </p>
<p>『You should not get angry.  We’ll fight against the Raidos Kingdom anyway』</p>
<p>「... Nn」</p>
<p>  Fran was no longer going to stop.  She must be actively involved in the fight against the Raidos Kingdom. The killing intent that Fran was giving off right now was so strong that it was convinced that it had been confirmed.  But still, was the knife used to kill demons mass-produced?  ... Derick himself did not know the specifics of how to make it.  But, of course, he knew the creator.  The person who made it was the alchemist Ansel. To my surprise, he was a leader in the research of the Divine Sword and a disciple of Zelyse.  He was the one who conducted the research on the Divine Sword, Zelyse’s magic stone knowledge, data on the Pseudo Fanatic Sword, and the actual magic sword for killing demons.But still, was the sword for killing demons mass-produced? ...Derick himself didn’t know the specifics of how to make it.

As a result of bringing all of these together, they succeeded in mass-producing a knife for killing demons.</p>
