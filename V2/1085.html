</div><h1>Chapter 1085</h1><p>《The effect of self-evolution has been activated. I’ve earned 100 self-evolution points.》</p>
<p>『Alright! It’s been a while since I’ve had self-evolution!』</p>
<p>「Master, congratulations!」</p>
<p>『Thanks!』</p>
<p> The antidemons on the continent of Gordicia didn’t have magic stones, and I greatly reduced my magic stone value due to my Potential Release. I thought it would take a longer time, but thanks to the bonus stage, I was able to evolve myself at once. Moreover, my self-evolution points were bad. Because Fenrir-san had lost his power, I didn’t get many points when I evolved myself for a while. I haven’t gotten so many points in a while. I haven’t gotten so much points in a while.  Wasn’t the amount I had accumulated all at once?  </p>
<p>『Well, let’s do this at once!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  There were eight remaining magic stone soldiers. There was no way they could escape Fran and Urushi, and the invasion was completed in less than three minutes.  </p>
<p>『Uwaah, that was a good prey!』</p>
<p>「Nn!  Master looks happy」</p>
<p>『It’s been a long time since I’ve self-evolution!』</p>
<p>  Moreover, my magic stone value had been less than 1000 until my next self-evolution.  It wouldn’t be too long until I self-evolution again. </p>
<p>『Well, I wonder what’s going on with the old guys?』</p>
<p>「Undead have dropped a lot」</p>
<p>『Yeah, certainly』</p>
<p>  The undead that had been nearly 5,000 had been reduced by half.  No, now about 300 more of them had been defeated in front of us. It was a tremendous annihilation power. Moreover, the coordination was also skillful.  The leader of the group was Gwad. He used skills to provoke their opponent and took on almost all the undead’s hate with one hand.  </p>
<p>「Doryaaaaaah!」</p>
<p>  With loud shouts, he swung down a huge hammer more than himself and literally crushed the undead.  Thanks to the heavy armor he wore, he was able to remain unharmed no matter how much he was gathered in the undead. This was how the battle unfolded like a dwarve.  Diaz seemed to be guarding two rearguards a little behind him.Diaz seemed to be guarding two rearguards a little behind him.  While defeating the undead that Gumdo had shot out, he was using illusion magic to guide the undead toward Gumdo.  He must be trying to freeze the undead as much as possible in one place.  Then, Eiworth’s magic exploded.  He used ice and snow magic to freeze a large area. About 200 undead that had swarmed Gumdot were covered by white frost.  Or rather, Gumdot was also involved!  To my surprise, Gumdot didn’t seem to care about magic and continued to crush the undead in the snowstorm.  Eiworth was once the target of magic against his friends in the Royal Capital. Is this the cause of this uninhabited behavior?!  If he was always fighting like this, it wouldn’t be surprising if he thought that he could get involved as long as he didn’t die.  Next, Felmus’ strings raged wildly.  The strings that were laid out over a wide area raged in unison and cut through the undead. That would have shattered another hundred.  Moreover, if the old men were to get serious, they would be able to destroy them even faster. However, they dared to cut down the undead with this strategy.  Because they didn’t even know what would happen after this, they chose a battle method that reduced their undead’s wear and tear. In fact, their caution was met.  </p>
<p>『A huge magical reaction from the Shallus army!』</p>
<p>「There’s a pillar of light.」</p>
<p> The Shallus army, who had remained in the back without entering the undead’s rescue, raised a huge pillar of light.  A rather strong magical power was released, and the pillar of light gradually transformed into a magic circle.  Wasn’t that pretty bad if we didn’t leave it alone?  For now, we should unleash our magic and interfere with it! It seems that I wasn’t the only one who thought that way.  As soon as I released my magic, Eiworth and Felmus attacked.  Eiworth activated deadly poison magic and ice and snow magic at the same time.  Felmus rained down the strings to pierce the soldiers. They were really all-powerful if he mastered them.  They may have defeated quite a few soldiers, but the soldiers did not move from their positions.Having defeated quite a few soldiers, the soldiers did not move from their positions.  No, it seemed that their movements were blocked in some way, and they were unable to move instead of not moving.  And then the magic circle emitted a particularly strong light.  What remained after the flash of light was thousands of soldiers lying on the ground and a huge creature.  It was a brown lump about as big as a small mountain...  </p>
<p>『A dragon?  A dragon, right? It’s just so huge, isn’t it...?』</p>
<p>  It’s several times larger than the water dragon I’ve seen before.  It’s probably at least ten times larger than a water dragon. Even in its current state, it was nearly 100 meters high.  The aggressive magic power was conveyed to me.  It was obviously a threat level of B or higher. In some cases, it might even be A.  </p>
<p>「Oi oi!  That’s a mountain dragon! It’s a high-ranking species dragon!」</p>
<p>「Hello!  I haven’t seen one in a while. I guess from its body color, it’s a type that lives on this continent.」</p>
<p>「However, it’s small for a mountain dragon.」</p>
<p>「It’s because I cut down the magic power of my summoning, huh? It’s a little rough, but its flesh quality doesn’t look good」</p>
<p>  As expected of dragon experts!  I easily found out what it was!  I heard that mountain dragons were dragons that grew huge like mountains. It seemed to have a threat level of C*A and a threat level of approximately 300 meters. It’s said to grow up to nearly 300 meters long, so this guy is probably still small. </p>
<p>「Miss Hilt!  Can you take the lead?」</p>
<p>「Nn.  What am I supposed to do?」</p>
<p>「I’m gonna ask for your help. Keep building up your power until you get the signal.」</p>
<p>「Okay.」</p>
<p>  Fran obediently obeys Gwad’s words.  She was their forerunner as an adventurer, guildmaster, and expert in fighting dragons. That’s why there’s no reason not to obey.  </p>
<p>「All right!  It’s been a long time since I’ve been hunting dragons!」</p>
<p>「Hyah! I’m so tired of the necromancy!」</p>
<p>「I heard you were summoned, but will you still have a corpse? I’d like to get scales too.」</p>
<p>「The dragon’s tongue is a treat, so please leave it to us.」</p>
<p>  The old men stared at the mountain dragons as they started to move, precisely targeting their prey.  I wonder why Fran, the natural enemy of the magic stone soldiers, and Gwad, the natural enemy of the dragons, are so coincidentally together?</p>

<p> The old men stared at the mountain dragons as they started to move, precisely targeting their prey. I wonder why Fran, the natural enemy of the magic stone soldiers, and Gwad, the natural enemy of the dragons, are so coincidentally together? Yeah, I’m sure it was because of the misdeeds of the Raidos Kingdom’s daily work.</p>
