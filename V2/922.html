</div><h1>Chapter 922</h1><p>『Fran! Sorry I kept you waiting!』</p>
<p>「Don’t wait at all.」</p>
<p> It felt like a long time because she dived deep into the world of her mind, but in reality, it only lasted for a few minutes. Well, in the few minutes that happened, the situation had changed drastically! Fran had left the walls and moved forward a long time. She was completely surrounded by an army of antidemons. But I guess it was easier for her now, since she didn’t need to involve her comrades in the fight. But I guess it was easier for Fran now to fight since she didn’t need to involve her comrades in it. </p>
<p>「Teryaaa!」</p>
<p> She was in the middle of a huge amount of black lightning around her.  </p>
<p>(Master, let’s go!)</p>
<p>『Yeah!』</p>
<p>  Just by holding the hilt, I could understand Fran’s evolution. It wasn’t just a matter of increasing her stats.  Her swordsmanship seemed to have been strengthened.  There was a strange sense of elation, as if she was being held by Fran, who was in a state of Sword God Transformation. </p>
<p>『Here, go!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  Fran pulled me out on her back and swung me out with the same momentum.  A slash that was just imbued with magic power. However, it was even more powerful than the Sword Saint Technique.  </p>
<p>「Haaa!」</p>
<p>『Hahaha!  Amazing!  Fran!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  So, this was the power of the Divine Beast!  I felt like it was fast enough earlier, but I wasn’t serious yet! The speed was terrifying!  Fran was dashing around incessantly at super high speeds that didn’t even leave an afterimage. Every time I was swung, countless antidemons disappeared, and the shockwaves blew the antidemons even farther away. After Fran ran through the water, several extremely thick black lightning bolts went on a rampage, eating antidemons over a wide area.  Just like that, no matter if the antidemons were black or red. They were no longer ordinary antidemons, there was not much difference between them and goblins. Fran continued to swing me as she was lucky enough to get hit by the antidemons in her way.  </p>
<p>「Master!  Somehow!  It’s so fun!」</p>
<p>『Y-You’re very motivated!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  Fran smiled.  She seemed to be even more excited than usual. It seemed that she was in a state of excitement from becoming a Divine Beast.  The elation of her strong power and the increase of her wildness from getting closer to the beast were a combination of them. They must be a combination of them.  This may be the first time I’ve ever seen a smile like her.  </p>
<p>(Hey! What kind of power did Master get?)</p>
<p>『O-okay?』</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
<p>『Of course. I’ll show you the skills I’ve acquired!』</p>
<p>(Oooh!)</p>
<p>  I guess I’m just as excited as she is. The adventurer’s song may have the effect of raising the spirits of those who hear it.  </p>
<p>『Let’s go!  Activate the skill, “King Wolf”!』</p>
<p>  Sniff!  I could feel a huge amount of magic power coming from within me. Well, it was normal for me, though.  But it was not a big consumption for me right now. </p>
<p>「Hmm?」</p>
<p>  Fran’s body was covered with black magic power. Rather than covering it, it was wrapped like a thin veil.  It was dignified, wasn’t it? It was not as evil as it was, but as fierce as black lightning.  Fran, who was clad in black magic power, felt a dignity and elegance that allowed her to naturally follow her surroundings. The closest atmosphere to us was Fenrir after all.  The King Wolf skill was Fenrir’s strengthening skill using magic power. However, that was not the only thing that had the power of this skill.  The change had occurred to me as well.  My decorative strings stretched out with great force and branched out at a tremendous speed. At the same time, I could see that they were trying to shape something by intertwining in a complicated way.  Moreover, as they were intertwined and curled, they branched further and swelled more and more. It was as if the bunches of the huge giant peak were lying on the side. Eventually, each fruit began to swell and was separated from the branches to form an individual.  </p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Grrrr!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>「Iron Wolf?」</p>
<p>『That’s also the ability of the King Wolf』</p>
<p>  It was a metal wolf about five meters long that was created. I could feel a sense of dread from its intimidating appearance.  </p>
<p>『That was...  the Me from that time, huh!?』</p>
<p>  I went out of control as a result of using my skill taker to steal Ashwrath’s Mad Demonization. After using my Potential Release, I turned into a steel wolf and attacked Grandma Kiara.  To be honest, I didn’t remember clearly, but I managed to remember what I looked like. These wolves were very similar to me at that time. The King Wolf skill was a skill that strengthened the wielder with Fenrir’s magic power and created steel wolves.  It was the power to transform their wielder into a wolf king.  Maybe it was an ability that reflected the characteristics of the wolf that was making a flock.  </p>
<p>『Ake!』</p>
<p>「Grrrr!」</p>
<p>「Ooh, amazing!」</p>
<p>  The steel wolves were quite strong.  Their fangs and claws easily tear through the antidemons, and their armor easily repelled the attacks of lower class antidemons. Antidemons that could keep up with their movements were rare, and each time the wolf ran, the antidemons disappeared.  If they were in a flock, they would be able to fight head-on with Urushi before he was strengthened by the oratorio. Well, not that we could win though. </p>
<p>(Is Master even moving all of them?)</p>
<p>『Half.』</p>
<p>  Normally, these steel wolves were autonomous kin.  They think and move independently. They may or may not be conscious, but they have a lot of robotic personality.  However, these steel wolves were now connected to me.  It was possible to move them individually but also to follow my instructions. Moreover, I had perfect control over all the Wolf. I have the Simultaneous Operation skill, but I usually don’t have this much control over them.  This was thanks not only to the King Wolf skill, but also the Fanatics and Wisdom skills. They were connected by the Steel Wolf created by the King Wolf with Fanatics and were perfectly controlled by their Wisdom.  Wisdom was an ability I inherited from Cherubim―― announcer-san.  A Divine Sword that could access and overwrite information about the Divine Territory. People tend to focus on that part, but the most terrifying thing was its computing power.  It had the ability to instantly find the information you were looking for and select the information you were looking for from the library of information from all over the world. It would be easy enough to control ten Steel Wolf at the same time.  King Wolf, Fanatics, and Wisdom. The King Wolf was much stronger and more numerous.  Fanatics was even more fearsome and ugly.  Wisdom was much wiser and faster.  It was probably only a tenth of its original ability. However, when the three were combined, he was able to unleash his abilities that were impossible to achieve.  </p>
<p>『Moreover, this is possible!』</p>
<p>  When I ordered him to do this, one of the Steel Wolfs was knocked away.  However, it was not that he had self-destructed. And then, the steel threads that had killed more than a hundred antidemons took the shape of a wolf again.</p>
<p>『Fufun, right?』</p>
