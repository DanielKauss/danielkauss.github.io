</div><h1>Chapter 1066</h1><p>The day after we delivered the refugees from the port town of Dards to Lockers. We left the town at sunrise. Our destination was the village of Metelmam, a village that didn’t communicate with anyone. </p>
<p>『It seems to be a little further up the mountain road. Urushi’s legs should take us about an hour to reach here.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p> Yesterday, when the guildmaster suggested that Fran should scout out the missing adventurers, Fran decided to accept the request after a little deliberation. Metelmam was a village between us and her neighboring country, Philias. If they were to hold on to that village, they would be cut off from contact with Philias. That was one of the reasons why she decided to accept the request. I guess that was one of the reasons why she decided.  However, the main reason was for Charlotte’s safety.  Charlotte was about to be sacrificed for some kind of ritual. If she was about to be taken to Metelm for some kind of ritual, she might be able to understand the details if she went there.  That was the most important reason for the request.  Urushi was flying high in the sky, so high that his shadow could not be seen on the earth, and he found something in front of him.  </p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>『What’s that? Something’s flying...?』</p>
<p>  It wasn’t as high as we were, but something black was floating in the air as if it was bobbing.  It was like a magic beast with bat-like wings and a demon... Just below the flying object, we could see a faint Metermum. It hadn’t been noticed yet because it was using illusion magic and light magic to disguise its appearance just like when we scouted out Dars.  But what should we do?  It would be bad to attack it out of the blue. There’s a high possibility that it’s related to Raydoss, but it’s troublesome if it’s not.  However, it’s too stupid to show up if it’s an enemy. We would have to surprise them or wait to see how they would react.  But we didn’t have to think about it right away. As we got even closer, the other side noticed us.  I looked around and turned my face to us.  Then, as if I was staring steadily, it rose to the same altitude as Urushi. It seemed that they were an opponent with higher detection abilities than we had expected.  </p>
<p>(Are they exposed?)</p>
<p>『Probably』</p>
<p>(What do they do? Attack them?)</p>
<p>『No, wait a minute. When this happens, you’d better find out who they are』</p>
<p>(Okay)</p>
<p>(Woof)</p>
<p>「I know from the flow of the air that they’re there! Reveal yourself!」</p>
<p>  Aah, I see.  So it was their ability to detect them using wind and air, huh?  If the air current was strange in the sky where there was no shield, I’d notice that. So, I had no choice but to let the concealment break Fran and Urushi.  </p>
<p>「A lot of kids? Who are they?」</p>
<p>「...The adventurers of the Kingdom of Kranzel」</p>
<p>「!」</p>
<p>  The moment Fran told her so, the opponent’s face twisted violently. Well, with dark skin, I couldn’t even understand his expression.  His voice was like that of an elderly man, but his appearance was far from that of a human. In fact, he was completely that of a demon.  He had jet-black skin, bat wings, and a slender macho body.  His equipment was also jet-black metal armor. It had a very sophisticated design, and I could clearly tell that it was equipped with knights and similar equipment.  A demon in black armor.  That was all he looked like, but his race was human.  Perhaps it had something to do with his skill, Demon Possession. The knights were in a state of being fused with the demon.  </p>
<p>「...... Get away. Then he suddenly slashed at her.  </p>
<p>「Shii!」</p>
<p>「Mwah!」</p>
<p>  Fran took the slash without any injuries and jumped back, but the attack was clearly to kill her now.  </p>
<p>「Did you dodge the one now?」</p>
<p>「Are you from the Raidos Kingdom?」</p>
<p>「... I mean, you from the Raidos Kingdom?」</p>
<p>「... I’m sure you’re from the Raidos Kingdom because of lacking anything to say!」</p>
<p>「The cowards who suddenly slash at you without mentioning your name are surely from the Raidos Kingdom」</p>
<p>「T-that’s not it!」</p>
<p>「Then tell me your name and organization」</p>
<p>「... Don’t die!」</p>
<p>  So, it was no good to provoke them. I heard that you were not from the Raidos Kingdom, but it would be a problem if you went to Metelmam. When you think of the demons, you might think of the Kingdom of Philias, but you wonder what they’re doing here.  In normal circumstances, it meant that they came to capture Metelmam for the benefit of war hunters. But Philias shouldn’t be interested in expanding his territories, right? Worst case scenario, Filurias was also controlled by Raidos like Seedran, and we could imagine a scenario where he invaded the Kranzel Kingdom.  </p>
<p>(Master.  Let’s catch him.)</p>
<p>『Okay.』</p>
<p> The fierce aerial battle began as it was.  Their opponent had wings and was used to fighting in the air, but there was too much difference in ground strength. Fran parried all the attacks from the demon knights and slashed off their limbs with a counterattack.  If they hadn’t had regeneration, they would have been in a dormant state within a few minutes of the start.  </p>
<p>「I-What does this kid mean......!? I’m going to use the arms of a higher-ranking sword in my squad...」</p>
<p>  His Holy Sword Mastery was at a high level of 3, so he must have been very confident.  Moreover, he was in an aerial battle where he should have the advantage. He was easily knocked away by a ball of cards in a battle that could not be defeated and he was astonished.  As long as we win, there is no problem.  Urushi hasn’t done anything yet. However, it would be a bit hard to catch an opponent that has such high regenerative power.Immediately afterward, an enormous amount of magical power enveloped the entire body of the knight.</p>
