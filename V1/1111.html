</div><h1>Chapter 1111</h1><p>『Not magic, but a direct attack. And if it doesn’t cause any damage to the town――』</p>
<p>(Put.)</p>
<p>『Yeah, that’s good then』</p>
<p>Fran continued to walk, discussing with me, and kneading her magic power. She hadn’t run away yet.</p>
<p>She must have been watching to see how the other side would react.</p>
<p>She seemed to be planning to calm down and build up her power until it was attacked. Her opponent was a Great-Spirit. In terms of threat level, she was unquestionably A or higher.</p>
<p>What a bad attack would do to her.</p>
<p>They must be able to detect its nucleus and hit it with the most powerful blow possible. That was the best way to go.</p>
<p>「It’s coming!」</p>
<p>『Yeah!』</p>
<p>I couldn’t sense any spirits’ behavior. However, Fran seemed to be able to feel the spirit’s breathing well. She was able to sense and move the spirit’s attack.</p>
<p>A sharper blow than ever pierced the place where Fran had been. A deep hole, which could even be called a small crater, opened into the ground.</p>
<p>Apparently, the Great Spirit was also serious. No, maybe it had become a clear enemy from the one being eliminated.</p>
<p>Fran dashed through the ruined noble district, dodging the spears of wind that were released one after another. There were no signs of people around. They must have escaped, or――.</p>
<p>The damage would only get worse if we left the town as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Perhaps because she decided that a single attack would not hit Fran, the attacks of the Great Spirit changed. Small wind bullets began to rain down on a wide area like a shot gun.</p>
<p>Moreover, each shot was quite powerful. That’s plenty of killing power. One shot would be enough to kill an orc.</p>
<p>If Fran were to unleash such a series of attacks, there would be no way for her to escape. But Fran stepped forward without stopping.</p>
<p>She knew I was gonna do something about it.</p>
<p>I created a series of wind walls in the direction Fran was going and created a path for her to follow. Fran charged in before she could see any results, rushing through the small space.</p>
<p>If she was still unable to respond, she slipped through with Dimension Shift. The reason why she didn’t use teleportation was that she might be able to detect the teleportation destination and attack it in advance.</p>
<p>We’ve experienced it many times in the past. If it was the Great Spirit Class, the danger would be high. That was what we thought when we first moved to Klimt and Zelos Reed’s side, but we didn’t use teleportation. Well, the time it took to reach them would be much different for Fran now.</p>
<p>As a result, Fran had traveled almost to the closest distance, and in no time at all, we were approaching the Great Spirit.</p>
<p>But the problem stemmed from here.</p>
<p>『It keeps attacking on us!』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p>I’m no longer at the barrage level. I heard wind bullets, wind spears, and wind slashes. The attacks of the Great Spirit that filled the space were sure to kill and shit in a shooting game.</p>
<p>If I hadn’t used Dimension Shift, I wouldn’t have been left unscathed.</p>
<p>They told me that spirits had nuclear weapons, and that I should attack them...</p>
<p>『Where it is? I feel like I’m feeling something, but...』</p>
<p>So, this was the presence of nuclear weapons and spirits? I had a strange sensation, like a chilled spine. If I tried to remember a similar sensation, it would be like seeing Ignis in Gordicia......? Maybe crisis detection was just telling me something in the face of a strong opponent?</p>
<p>『Fran, how is it?』</p>
<p>(Nn... I don’t know. I can’t feel any sign of him at all right now, probably because of magic)</p>
<p>Dimension Shift was able to slip through the attack, but it also seemed to slip through the opponent’s presence. Now that you mention it, the vicinity was showing very little presence.</p>
<p>It was not that I couldn’t feel it, but it seemed to be unsuited for a situation where I was delicately searching for something.</p>
<p>『...We’ll have to solve the Dimension Shift.』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p>Fran nodded eagerly, but it was not that easy. If we deactivate the Dimension Shift now, we would be under attack with a force that did not yet stop.</p>
<p>(Klimt said we didn’t have time.)</p>
<p>『Kuh... I guess so.』</p>
<p>It seems like we have to find the nuke while running away. I checked Klimt’s condition for a moment, and I could feel that his life force was starting to decrease again.</p>
<p>『Let’s go! Okay?』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>『Alright―――Can it be canceled!』</p>
<p>As soon as she regained her physical form, the explosions and blasts of wind rushed in at once. Wind attacks of all kinds attacked her from all directions.</p>
<p>We immediately put up a barrier, and when we found a small gap in the wind, we forced our way out. No matter how much we escaped, the wind would follow us no matter how far we went.</p>
<p>Fran was still bouncing around at high speed, releasing magic to offset the wind. But even so, complete evasion was difficult. Evil attacks that pierced through barriers, which were sometimes mixed in with weak attacks, were troublesome. It was very difficult to detect invisible attacks that were hidden among the hundreds of attacks.</p>
<p>However, Fran did not lose her concentration. She continued to look for the nucleus of the spirit, even though her skin was engraved with countless wounds and sometimes even bones.</p>
<p>Still, I couldn’t find it. And yet, it was getting closer and closer to its limit.</p>
<p>It was like we were running as fast as we could right now. Fran had already awakened and used Brilliant Lightning Rush, and I had activated my magic multiple times to the very limit.</p>
<p>If things continue like this, we might collapse in the not-so-distant future.</p>
<p>In the midst of all this, a change appeared in Fran. A magic power emanating from within her that did not belong to Fran.</p>
<p>『Is this, Marl!?』</p>
<p>(Nn. Maal is telling me the truth.)</p>
