</div><h1>Chapter 927</h1><p>The civilians clapped Fran and Sophie with thunderbolts, but they seemed to be exhausted as well. Many of them were unable to stand the pressure and sat themselves back down. Some of them were also injured. It seems the battle wasn’t the only cause of their injuries. They must have been injured when they rescued soldiers and adventurers from the rubble of the wall that had been destroyed by the cannon-type. Some of them were too enraged to even sing. Sophie’s condition was particularly bad among these people. Sophie’s condition was particularly bad among these people.  The tips of her fingers were covered in blood, and her claws had been peeled off. She had used up all of her strength. But Sophie greeted us with a smile, even though she looked exhausted. </p>
<p>「Guys, thank you very much for saving Sendia.」</p>
<p>「Sophie and his friends, thank you. </p>
<p>「That’s right!  I would love to hold a party, but...... A little drowsiness......」</p>
<p>「Me too......」</p>
<p>  Fran, Mea, and Velmeria were about to collapse at any moment. They were too exhausted to control their drowsiness. </p>
<p>「Grrr?」</p>
<p>『Rindo!  Thank you very much for your help!』</p>
<p> Just in time, Lind’s appearance began to disappear, and a telepathy had reached him. He let out a shriek and disappeared. </p>
<p>「Is Miss Hilt okay?」</p>
<p>「Are you okay?」</p>
<p>「I’m not going to sleep here so much」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p> It seemed that Zefmate and Urushi didn’t have enough time to sleep like this. I guess there were individual differences after all.  </p>
<p>「Unyu...」</p>
<p>「W-woof!」</p>
<p> We rushed to Fran, who was flustered, and Urushi supported her. </p>
<p>「Let’s take her somewhere into the building」</p>
<p>「Y-you’re right!」</p>
<p>「Fran, do your best a little more」</p>
<p>「Umyu」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Miss Hilt, come this way」</p>
<p>「Hmmm...」</p>
<p>「Dragon girl too, come this way」</p>
<p>  Zefmate was lending Mea his shoulder as he managed to pull off Velmeria’s hand. Sophie could leave the rest to her.  She sent Fran and Frederick to a private house nearby.  It seems this was the home of someone who had taken part in the valiant army. She usually used it as a storage room.  I covered the floor with covers as if Fran had taken it out of the dimensional storage. For now, I guess we should just take out five of them, right?  Then Urushi and Zefmate put the girls to rest.  </p>
<p>『Hold off, Fran』</p>
<p>「Nn...」</p>
<p>  She must have reached the limit.  Fran nodded lightly and fell into the world of her dream. Mea and Velmeria have already slept.  </p>
<p>『Urushi, how is it?』</p>
<p>「... Ofa~」</p>
<p>  Urushi and Zefmate looked sleepy too. But if they fall asleep here, I’ll be worried about Fran and Urushi’s safety. Or rather, how about my backlash?  My evil spirits have already subsided. It seems that I can still use my skills, but...  </p>
<p>『Fenrir?  Announcer-san?』</p>
<p>『Master, are you done?』</p>
<p>《Attension of evil energy detected.  predicted to be over.》</p>
<p>『Do you see it?』</p>
<p>  The usual Fenrir and Announcer-san should be able to see the outside from inside of me. In fact, it seems that both of them know most of my actions.  </p>
<p>《In order to stop the outburst of the activated area, I used all of my abilities to control it. During that time, all the information about the outside world was blocked.》</p>
<p>『The main idea is that I’ve done a lot of hard work and didn’t know anything about it at all.  Well, you won, right? There’s no way you can use that much magic and evil energy to defeat it.』</p>
<p>『Yeah, the antidemons have been completely exterminated.  So, what will happen to me after this? If I’m going to sleep for a long time because of the backlash, I’m worried about Fran’s defenses.』</p>
<p>  So far, there has been no sign of any backlash. I didn’t feel much of my exhaustion as I did when I used my Potential Release.  </p>
<p>『Don’t worry about that.  We’ll split up and take care of the backlash on Master and Fran』</p>
<p>《Affirmative.  I expect both of them to only use mild exhaustion》</p>
<p>『Eh?  You mean that Fenrir and the others will bear the price for me and Fran? Are you okay?』</p>
<p>『We might not be able to make contact with Master for a while again, but that’s all. Don’t worry until they disappear』</p>
<p>『Even if you’re told to rest assured by that...  Besides, you’re willing to take on the backlash of Fran... Is that possible?』</p>
<p>『I’m glad that the Divine Beast appeared on Fran.  This is a former Divine Beast, you know? As long as the connection is slight, it can manage』</p>
<p>  It seemed that it was because she was a former Divine Beast that she could interfere with the Divine Beast. Fenrir would take on Fran’s wear and tear and the price, and she would also share it with Announcer-san.  </p>
<p>《This is a measure for the safety of the individual named Fran, the wielder. </p>
<p>『Something like that. It’s our strength to be able to work together at a time like this, right?』</p>
<p>『... It really doesn’t mean that Fenrir and Announcer-san will disappear, right?』</p>
<p>《Yes.  They go into dormant for a certain period of time, but they can return to normal in a short period of time》</p>
<p>『Well, I think it will be a few weeks at the most, right?』</p>
<p>『I see...』</p>
<p>  Certainly, when I think about Fran, I am grateful that I can keep up. I should rely on Announcers-san for this.  </p>
<p>『I’m always sorry. I’m just counting on Announcer-san for this.』</p>
<p>《Negative.  Here I am grateful.》</p>
<p>『Announcer-san is right.  She is able to do a worthwhile job, even if she was just waiting for us to disappear. Are you grateful?』</p>
<p>《Affirmative.  It is as the individual named Fenrir said. Individual named Master and individual named Fran, thank you》</p>
<p>『I’m not going to lose my power as well as Announcer-san. Well, don’t think I’m on a vacation for a while』</p>
<p>  Fenrir’s magic stone absorption ability.  My translations and Announcer-san’s support are still available. It seems that they can use these as usual.  </p>
<p>『Okay. And there is one more thing that’s bothering me, can I ask you?』</p>
<p>『What was that King Wolf’s Sword, Fenrir?』</p>
