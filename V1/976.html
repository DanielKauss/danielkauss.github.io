</div><h1>Chapter 976</h1><p>At the price of taking away the giant’s right leg, the snow fell to the ground, looking as if it had run out of spirit and power.</p>
<p>But none of them dared to help her. Even the guards standing right next to her, the mob, refused to move. They were just standing next to the rough-blooded Matley, to protect her.</p>
<p>A hydrangea came up to us. He jumped off the carriage with a light body and approached the short run of the tree.</p>
<p>In her hand, she held another jet-black sheath. It must be Berserk’s sheath.</p>
<p>While still at her knees, she picked up Berserk with a trembling hand and held him horizontally in front of her.</p>
<p>The hydrangea, on the other hand, slowly put Berserk in its scabbard with both hands. After a few seconds, Berserk was completely slayed with a cracking sound.</p>
<p>Then the monster immediately moved and picked up the young man with a big smile. Perhaps there was a reason why he couldn’t touch it while Berserk was unsheathed.</p>
<p>『Yeah, and that toughness... I don’t think it was just because of her high status』</p>
<p>That exhaustion even without being released. Well, it’s no wonder she’ll die if she puts her mind to it.</p>
<p>(Master, we’ll be taking out these giants.)</p>
<p>『Yeah.』</p>
<p>The super giant-type had been greatly enhanced by the fusion of its giant-types. However, he had fallen to the ground due to the loss of one of his legs.</p>
<p>『I still won’t regenerate. Maybe it’s Berserk’s ability? Anyway, this is the perfect time for us!』</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
<p>This was our greatest chance now that everyone was struggling to get up. Everyone knew that.</p>
<p>You gathered the soldiers together again, and the adventurers went around to support them.</p>
<p>「Hey young miss! Give me five minutes!」</p>
<p>「Okay!」</p>
<p>Isario was not going to use the Divine Sword Release, but was instead trying to unleash a powerful attack by taking a long buildup.</p>
<p>Neither Fran nor I wanted her to use the Divine Sword Release. She didn’t use the Divine Sword that often. The backlash and exhaustion alone are tremendous burdens.</p>
<p>Now I could see just how surprising it was for me that Ashwrath had shown us the power of the Divine Sword in the Beastman Country.</p>
<p>It took Isario a pretty long buildup, but I guess that’s just how strong the super giant-type was.</p>
<p>『Fran, let’s crush our remaining left leg』</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
<p>『Urushi, you can use the bottomless shadow to attack its arm. Even if it doesn’t work, I can just block its footing』</p>
<p>(Woof!)</p>
<p>Bottomless Shadow was a technique that swallowed the opponent into the space of the shadow opened in the ground and made them disappear. However, the speed at which it swallowed was slow, and if it couldn’t swallow the entire body of the enemy, it could not be fully activated and escaped.</p>
<p>It would be impossible to swallow this huge body. However, the shadow on the move was like a bottomless swamp, making it harder to stand on the ground than on the average person.</p>
<p>「Urushi, let’s do it!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Fran and I were both aiming for the giant ankles. As soon as we put in enough force to get him up, we fired a series of thunder spells at him.</p>
<p>「Haaah! Brilliant Lightning Rush! Kanna Kamui!」</p>
<p>『Kanna Kamui!』</p>
<p>With Fran and I, a total of four Kanna Kamui shattered the giant ankles. The super giant-type, which was trying to shift into a bridging state to get up, lost its support and struck its back on the earth again.</p>
<p>『Fran! Pursuit! Inflict more damage to his legs before they are regenerated!』</p>
<p>「Nn! Haaaaah!」</p>
<p>Fran, who had run through the sky and approached the ankle of the giant figure, activated her sword technique as hard as she could. It was not a Heaven Judgement that required a buildup, but an instant-use Holy Sword Art.</p>
<p>「Brade Ronde!」</p>
<p>Blade Rondo, the level 8 Holy Sword Arts, was basically a series of ultra-high-speed slashes. About twelve slashes were unleashed in three seconds, causing major wounds on the giant-shaped knees.</p>
<p>It was originally a technique to attack multiple enemies, but Fran concentrated her attack on a single point. The current Fran was able to use even a higher-level Holy Sword Art quite well.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean the giant-type has just been defeated.</p>
<p>「Muh?」</p>
<p>『That was dangerous!』</p>
<p>Against Fran’s sore throat after the technique, he was willing to take any damage and fired a magic bullet at her. I’m glad that she had prepared for the teleportation.</p>
<p>As I’d expected, she’s not the type of person to be underestimated.</p>
<p>The regeneration of my knees has already begun, but it will take tens of seconds for it to fully heal. It will take more time for me to get up from there.</p>
<p>(Master, next is her arm!)</p>
<p>『Got it!』</p>
<p>Urushi was attacking with a bottomless shadow on his left arm. He didn’t seem to like the feeling of sinking and couldn’t poke at it well.</p>
<p>『We’re after her right arm!』</p>
<p>「Nn! Haaaah!」</p>
<p>「Brrrrr!」</p>
<p>She severed it on her right arm, which remained with Sheaths of Wind, and activated Thunderbolt Magic in rapid succession. It was intended to hinder her movements and make her unable to use it to wake up.</p>
<p>I heard the giant-type roaring after it hated us. Perhaps in a hurry for a situation where things were not going well, the giant-type ignored us and held up its arms to try to get up forcibly. But I had been waiting for this.</p>
<p>『Here!』</p>
<p>She aimed for the moment she put her arm on the ground and slammed it with her full force telekinesis. The giant elbows, which were applied invisible power as if it was a cook from the inside, bent greatly.</p>
<p>「Buoooogh?」</p>
<p>The giant-type was lying on the ground again with an expression that said it had no idea why its elbows bent on its own. The impact of the body being slammed against it caused a swaying motion to run around.</p>
<p>Because of the Giant-type that had already occurred many times and had fallen over many times, the lower half of its body had collapsed.</p>
<p>「I’ll give you my knees again!」</p>
<p>『Yeah!』</p>
<p>As Fran and I were saving time by attacking the giant limbs, Isario shouted to us.</p>
<p>「Sorry to keep you waiting! Get away from me!」</p>
<p>At the same time, a pillar of flame exploded from the place where Isario stood, right in between the giant-type and the city.</p>
<p>I guess they were trying to minimize the damage as much as possible.</p>
<p>Fran and Urushi didn’t look back, just after they had moved away at their maximum speed.</p>
<p>「Haaa! Shall we turn into ashes!」</p>
<p>What Isario released was a huge sphere of flame.</p>
<p>A bright red ball of fire ran through the air, melting the earth like candy. And when it landed a direct hit on the giant torso, a crimson dome that swallowed the upper half of the body was created.</p>
<p>「Brrrr!」</p>
<p>From inside the huge dome over 100 meters in diameter, formed of fire, we could hear the pitiful screams of the giant figures.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, we didn’t sense much heat coming from it. Apparently, flames and heat were trapped inside the dome.</p>
<p>As proof of this, the ground bordering the dome only glowed a slight reddish-hot.</p>
<p>Isario must have chosen to attack with as little damage to the surrounding area as possible.</p>

<p>Some of the remaining lower body and arms crumbled apart and disappeared. No matter how tremendous their regenerative power was, they couldn’t be revived once their upper body was erased.</p>
<p>「Phew......... Sin......」</p>
<p>Isario cowered on the spot after witnessing our victory. He managed to avoid falling down thanks to the support of Ignis, but I could clearly see the fatigue and weary look on his face.</p>
<p>It seemed to be more worn out than the slash we had defeated the giant-type before. Still, this one was better than the Divine Sword Release.</p>
<p>Unlike this time, which was only exhausting my physical and magical power, the Divine Sword Release was even more exhausting. Even I, who was not a Divine Sword, could understand that.</p>
<p>「Isario! Are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, somehow... It’s just that I want to take a break」</p>
