</div><h1>Chapter 1108</h1><p>A pillar of light rose from the eastern side of Alessa. </p>
<p>「Alessa is...!」</p>
<p>『It’s around the area where the lord’s office is!』</p>
<p> A tremendous amount of magic power was released, causing great damage to the surrounding area. </p>
<p>(Voices, I can hear it.)</p>
<p>『Voices?』</p>
<p>(Call......)</p>
<p> I can’t hear any voices, right? But Fran seems to be hearing it. Could it be the voice of a spirit? As I watched the pillar of light, it gradually changed its shape. A violent wind seemed to be blowing in the meantime, but there was nothing we could do. It seemed that a violent wind was blowing around us in the meantime, but we couldn’t do anything. Then, three minutes later. </p>
<p>「I came to form a woman」</p>
<p>『I’ve heard that only high-ranking spirits are able to form a person...』</p>
<p>  A huge, human-typed being. Moreover, it’s only a violent wind that blows us.  </p>
<p>(Klimut’s, great spirit?)</p>
<p>『Yeah, it’s definitely the great spirit of the wind. But why is it in a town like this?』</p>
<p>  Even if Klimut and the others were to be attacked, they wouldn’t be able to counterattack with that great spirit.  If they were to use it, the surrounding area would surely be affected by the disaster. Even now, almost half of the wide noble district was probably damaged.  It seemed that something unexpected had happened and they were forced to send out a great spirit. </p>
<p>(What should we do?)</p>
<p>『What’s wrong...?』</p>
<p> The Great Spirit remained there.  There was no sign of movement. However, just being there, the wind raged wildly, and the damage to the surrounding area was increasing.  I could feel Klimut’s presence too.  He seemed to be still at the feet of the Great Spirit. Whether he could move or not, how much of the Great Spirit was under Klimut’s control in the first place?  </p>
<p>(Let’s go)</p>
<p>『You’re right. I’m sure Klimut is the only one who can do something about it...』</p>
<p>  I don’t think he can manage a fight, and if he goes on a rampage, Alessa will disappear. So, we have to hold him back peacefully. </p>
<p>「Urushi, wait here」</p>
<p>「Woof」</p>
<p>  Leaving Urushi to handle the captives, we decided to head for the main building. I didn’t know how effective it would be on the spirits, but I erased my presence and moved slowly along the main street.  </p>
<p>『Are you not aware of us...?』</p>
<p>(Nn...)</p>
<p> The spirits’ gazes were not fixed on us.  But I didn’t know what the spirit’s vision was. I didn’t know if it was aware of our presence or not. We approached them cautiously, thinking that they might suddenly attack us.  As a result, it seemed that it was good.  </p>
<p>『Fran!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  The wind bullet wentuggling in the place where Fran had just jumped on the spur of the moment. We were still quite far away, but would she really be attacked by them now?  </p>
<p>『Tsk!  We’ve found out!  There’s no need to hide anymore!  Run as fast as you can!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  After Fran’s stealth was broken, she gave her all she could to run. Countless wind bullets attacked us, but Fran continued to scratch everything and run across the main street.  She didn’t seem to be looking at us as usual, but her aim was quite accurate. Moreover, not only bullets but even invisible slashes had begun to be added.  She would have liked to escape even to the alleys, but if things didn’t go smoothly, the civilians would be affected. Fortunately, thanks to their accurate aim, only the people around the main street Fran were attacked. Fran knew this and continued to dodge her attacks with only the minimum possible movement, gentleness, and barriers.  </p>
<p>『Just a little more!』</p>
<p>「Nn...」</p>
<p>『What’s wrong, Fran?』</p>
<p>「You want to shout a spirit?」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>  I couldn’t hear it as usual, but Fran seemed to be able to hear it so much that she frowned.  I should have been able to detect it with my Spirit Detection, but I could sense a faint presence, but it was probably because it was a powerful spirit. Perhaps a strong adventurer would feel something similar to me. The place where the feudal lord’s office seemed to be in the distance was in a terrible disaster.  It was completely destroyed, and most of it was blown away by the wind of the spirits. Well, it was not only the feudal lord’s office but also the noble’s mansions in the area.  Is the only good thing that there didn’t seem to be much damage to the civilians?  There were signs of nobles running away, but they seemed to be being attacked by spirits. Their life force was wiped out in an instant.  </p>
<p>(Master!  Over there!)</p>
<p>『It’s Klimut and the others!』</p>
<p> Klimut and the others were located on the site of the lord’s mansion.  Both Urushi, the leader of the knights, and Zenos, the lord, were safe. However, Klimut was the only one who dyed his robe with bright red blood and fell to the ground.  Both on the left and right were caring for Klimut, but they seemed to be able to do nothing more than first aid. Was the reason why he didn’t run away was because he was so seriously injured that Klimut couldn’t move?  A little while later, at the site of the lord’s mansion, a particularly powerful attack was unleashed. Two huge tornadoes that suddenly occurred approached from the left and right as if they were trying to crush Fran.  </p>
<p>『Fran!  We’re going to cut them all!  I’ll hold them off!』</p>
<p>「Okay!」</p>
<p>  That’s why I used wind magic to create two tornadoes and fired them forward. And against the tornadoes created by the Great Spirit, my tornadoes collided.  This one is much smaller, but it doesn’t have to be completely canceled out.  </p>
<p>『Yosh!  It weakened a little!  Just focus on your attack!』</p>
<p>「Taaaah!」</p>
<p>  Even if it weakened, it would still be a tornado.  My barrier would be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>『Oi!  This is bad!</p>
<p>『Oi! This is bad! I’m dead on the verge of death!』</p>
