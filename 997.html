</div><h1>Chapter 997</h1><p>The place through the passage was a strange place. It was a dome-shaped room not only spacious but also tall, with countless gray roots that wriggled around as if they were beatings. It felt like the room of the Rasbos of a shooting game. And in the middle of it, a huge gray heart was sitting. </p>
<p>「Miss Hilt... That’s the nucleus of the Abyss Eater」</p>
<p>「Nn... I can’t destroy it」</p>
<p> That’s something that I can’t destroy」</p>
<p>  Fran, a spirit she normally wouldn’t know unless she tried to do it, said that it was impossible from the start. That’s how extraordinary the nucleus of the Abyss Eater was.  The evil mixed with its magic power and the size of its power that lies within it. And its presence was so faint that it made me wonder.  It was giving off an evil atmosphere that was worthy of the Abyss Eater’s nucleus, created based on the pieces of the Evil God, and could almost ruin one’s mind just by looking at it. Even the huge magic beast in the lake that Weena Rhyn had destroyed seemed to be of a lower rank in front of this heart.  It was just as big as a human heart. But isn’t it more than 50 meters long? Compared to the dragonkin standing in front of it, its hugeness was even more conspicuous.  </p>
<p>「Velmeria!  Tilanaria-sama!  Are you okay!?」</p>
<p>「Oi oi, no matter how you look at it, you’re all sane.」</p>
<p>  Velmeria was among the dragonkin standing in front of their hearts. No wait, it’s not just them. The other, large dragonkin, didn’t seem to be conscious either.  He was a terrifyingly powerful dragonkin with golden scales like Trismegistus.  Is this man the Dragon King Georg? If so, why did he seem to be losing his mind?  </p>
<p>「What’s wrong?」</p>
<p>「Velmeria!  Tilanaria!  Shit!  Georg, this is your doing!」</p>
<p>  The dragonkin didn’t respond when Frederick kept shouting out loud. As expected, something was wrong.  There was a small figure beside the three dragonkin. They wore robes so deeply that they couldn’t see their faces, but they didn’t look like dragonkin.  Did that robe bastard do something to them?  It seemed to have a similar effect to Seliadot’s wards, so appraisals couldn’t pass through their robes. Who was that?  After closer inspection, I could see that the robe bastard had a sword stuck at his heart.  It was a magic sword at the level at which appraisals could be repelled. It may have the power of a failed divine sword.  It didn’t look like it was attacking a nucleus, but what on earth was it?  The shape of the sword was bizarre.  It had two hilts and it looked as if the sword was crossed by a cross. However, the overlapping parts were actually combined to form a single sword.  How to use it?  Like a boomerang?  I tried to appraise it again.  I consciously knead the magic power of the Divine Attribute and activate the Heavenly Eye skill. By using the Divine Attribute, I could further enhance my skills. It was not so much that the output would simply increase, but it was more that the skill would go a notch deeper.  If it was a physical enhancement system, it would be easier to manipulate, and if it was magic, it would be easier to recreate my image. If it was the Heavenly Eye, it might even work against a superior opponent.  </p>
<p>『Gnrgh... I can see it!』</p>
<p>  For just a moment.  I wasn’t able to see everything, but I still got a lot of information.  </p>
<p>『What’s the status of that sword...?』</p>
<p> Name: Destroyer of the Heavenly Sword, Falldown, Evil Erosion Sword, Ebiru Y―――Attacking power: 70% Mana Conductivity: A+ Automatic Repair, Evil Absorption, Evil Domination, Evil Erosion――― It’s a lot of performance, but I’m worried about too much else.  First, the name. Apparently, it’s a fusion of two swords.  Besides, I’m also interested in their skills.  They seem to have the ability to control Evil Spirits. I’d like to check it out later, but I can’t just go around it. The dragonkin over there were all ready to fight at once.  </p>
<p>『Fran! They’re coming!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「I’m going to fight with the Dragon King! No one can do that unless they’re me.」</p>
<p>  Trismegistus remembered Georg’s name.  In other words, that was how strong that guy, who was not interested in others, was. Trismegistus showed no sign of movement.  I guess it meant he could kill each other on his own. They wouldn’t help us, but we didn’t have to worry about Tilanaria or Velmeria being killed by them anymore?  </p>
<p>「I’m Tilanaria! The Black Lightning Princess begging Velmeria!」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>  From the looks of it, Tilanaria didn’t seem to be very strong.  Velmeria, on the other hand, had activated her Divine Dragon Form. Indeed, Frederick might be too heavy for her.  </p>
<p>『We’re in trouble too!』</p>
<p>(But we have no choice.)</p>
<p>  The moment Fran readied me with determination, Velmeria and Frederick suddenly began moving into action. </p>
<p>『We have to make sure Velmeria and Frederick aren’t in front of the robe!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p> Fran stepped forward and swung me down from above.  </p>
<p>「Graaaaaaaaaaaah!」</p>
<p>「Haaaah!」</p>
<p>  My and Velmeria’s claws collided, creating a high-pitched sound.  It wasn’t a sword, but their claws were so damn tough!</p>
<p>『We’re bad too!』</p>
<p>(But we have no choice.)</p>
<p> The moment Fran readied me with determination, Velmeria and Frederick started moving at once. </p>
<p>『We have to make Velmeria and Frederick quiet in front of the robe bastard!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p> Fran stepped forward and swung me down from above. </p>
<p>「Graaaaaaaaaaaah!」</p>
<p>「Haaaah!」</p>
<p> My and Velmeria’s claws collided, creating a high-pitched sound. It wasn’t a sword, but their claws were so damn tough! They were just as tough as me......!</p>
