</div><h1>Chapter 1046</h1><p>The day after our departure from Gordicia, Fran immediately relaxed on the deck. She transformed Urushi into his just-suited size and laid him down as a long chair. Urushi was also getting better at riding Fran on it and chewing on it. Fran took out some fruit juice in that state and sucked the straws. It looked blissful. Incidentally, the straws were made from a material that looked just like plastic. Thanks to the presence of the magic beast materials, there must be an item that looked surprisingly similar to the one on Earth. So, thanks to the magic beast materials, there were surprisingly many items that were on par with Earth.  I was asked to write a letter to report that she was on the continent of Gordicia, but...She had been asked to write a letter to report that she had been to the Gordicia continent, but...  Well, the boat trips would still continue, and we would have time to write a report tomorrow or later.  Since this was a large ship with fast </p>
<p>「Good Wind」</p>
<p>  and </p>
<p>「Woof」</p>
<p>  sails, the wind was always blowing at the right strength on the deck.  Urushi’s long fur was quickly stroked and his fur was flying as strong as the strong wind Pomeranian.Fran, who was burying her entire body there, felt really comfortable.  She was being buried by a huge fluffy creature and was lazy drinking juice.  The problem was that she sometimes sneezing, but if she meditates there, all the children’s dream would be fulfilled.  </p>
<p>(Master)</p>
<p>『What?  </p>
<p>(I want to eat the pancakes)</p>
<p>『T-this is it?』</p>
<p>(Nn.  it’s no use?)</p>
<p>  Have you ever dreamed of becoming a child?  It had been a fierce battle in Gordicia, and I’m sure this much of a request would be cute. I took out the pancakes from the storage and handed it to Fran.  It was not that I was overwhelmed by Fran’s begging cuteness, wasn’t it?  </p>
<p>(Fufufufu.It was not that I had been fooled by Fran’s begging cuteness, wasn’t it?  </p>
<p>(Foooh, this is a huge serving of cream!)</p>
<p>『Fufufu, there’s so much fun hidden in the cream!  </p>
<p>(Fun?)</p>
<p>  It just has cut fruits, but she’s happy to have this kind of play with it.  In fact, Fran looks happy when she sticks the cream.  </p>
<p>「Fruit!」</p>
<p>『F-found it, mogu mogu.  It’s delicious.』</p>
<p>  She held up the fruit stabbed by the fork high and threw it straight into her mouth.  The cream around her mouth was sticky. </p>
<p>「Nn?  Aah, every time Fran moved, the cream got extra... Moreover, it was scattered in the wind and had white spots on a considerable area.  Just wiping it normally won’t remove it.</p>
<p>「Woof」</p>
<p>「Nn?  Aah, every time Fran moved, the cream became even more moist...  Moreover, it scattered in the wind and had white spots on a considerable area.  So, it wouldn’t come off just by wiping it normally.  You definitely need to wash it whole.  </p>
<p>「... If you don’t, it’ll fall into the sea」</p>
<p>「Woof!  If it’s sea water, your hair will get crisp later!  I’ll wash it with water magic.  Hmm? </p>
<p>「Okay, Urushi, it will become small」</p>
<p>「Woof!  When Urushi was smaller, the equipment had a size setting feature, but the dirt was still there. A large amount of cream entangled in it and the dirt entangled in the back of your hair was still normal.</p>
<p>「Okay.In other words, in front of us, a super dirty little dog with white cream and black dirt all over its body exploded.  There were also small pebbles scattered around the area.  I was not aware that it was on the ground, but the dirt coming from Urushi was very conspicuous on the deck.  It was a huge body that I had taken a simple bath in Gordicia.  If I moved a little, it would get dirty quickly.  Urushi would use the Bottomless Shadow to wipe the dirt off the perimeter. So, I’m using this technique.  </p>
<p>「You’ll wash it now?」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  As I was cleaning Urushi up like this, Fran’s movements stopped unexpectedly.  She only moved her head and stared at the sea. As I was cleaning Urushi, Fran’s movements suddenly stopped.  She moved only her head and stared at the sea.  However, Urushi was getting amazing things because she still had the water out.  </p>
<p>「Gar...!  It’s coming!  It’s time for the magic beast to stop!  I know it’s here!  Urushi was free from the forced waterfall process, shaking his body and sending water flying. Fran is completely away from the ship and looking down at the surface of the sea.  </p>
<p>『It’s coming!』</p>
<p>「Nn!  It was a huge sea Urushi with a diameter of about two meters that floated on the sea.  His name was Jumping Sea Urushi. He has skills like Jumping, Neidhart Production, and Blood Absorption. I guess he’ll just suck the blood and kill it if he jumps in and gets stabbed.  I want that magic stone.  It’s a common skill in otherworld reincarnation survival to allow you to suck the blood out of meat! The crew members start moving on the deck, but Fran was already out at that time.  I’ll catch the magic power of the Jumping Sea Weapon and find out where it was.  A total of about twenty of them, I think?  </p>
<p>『Fran. </p>
<p>『Fran.  Let’s defeat it with ice and snow magic instead of thunder magic』</p>
<p>(Why?  Lightning is easier)</p>
<p>  He must have understood from the experience of infiltrating the fierce battle that thunder magic penetrates through water and deals damage to the surrounding area.  Fran tilted her head.  But there was a serious reason why she couldn’t use it. </p>
<p>『If I let it get a fever, my body might deteriorate』</p>
<p>(Can I eat it?)</p>
<p>『Yeah.  It’s sea Urushi and it looks delicious』</p>
<p>(!Fran will be fine.</p>
