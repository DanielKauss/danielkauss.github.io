</div><h1>Chapter 967</h1><p>Three days have passed since we had to forcibly obtain the consent of Silard.</p>
<p>Countries’ troops were gathering in Nocta one after another.</p>
<p>Soldiers who could not fully enter the town even set up a tent outside the gate and were waiting there. In front of the south gate, nearly 500 tents of all sizes were lined up, and the smoke from cooking was rising.</p>
<p>I don’t know the exact number of adventurers, but there were a thousand adventurers from the surrounding towns, including dragonkin sent from the various settlements. In addition, there were about 4,000 knights and soldiers from the country who accepted the convocation.</p>
<p>I heard that in some of the weak countries, about ten people were dispatched to cook the tea, so it was impossible to say how many people from any country they were from.</p>
<p>Moreover, not all the troops were gathered in Nocta.</p>
<p>In addition to Nocta, five other towns were chosen as gathering points, and the entire horde was supposed to be over 30,000.</p>
<p>And now, it seems that the number of people was about half of what I had expected.</p>
<p>That’s because the battle against the giants had already caused a lot of damage.</p>
<p>Nocta, Sendia, and Brutori were able to defeat it with less damage. However, of course, not all the places were doing well.</p>
<p>Dragonkin and reinforcements from outside the barrier had been put in to defeat the giants that appeared in some towns.</p>
<p>It would still be fine if we could defeat it before we woke up, but I heard that some cities were already half destroyed by the giant-type attacks that began to move.</p>
<p>Some giants were said to start moving once their amniotes were lost above a certain level, and were still asleep. However, more than half of them started moving, and they are still continuing to rampage throughout the continent.</p>
<p>Soldiers and knights from various countries were also severely injured, and many countries did not have sufficient forces at all. On the contrary, several countries, including generals and commanders, had been annihilated.</p>
<p>A certain one of the executives of the administrative council had also arrived in Nocta, and was currently discussing future actions.</p>
<p>There were generals and unit leaders from various countries, several dragon generals, and senior adventurers from Isario and Fran. There were probably about 50 representatives of the mercenary group in total.</p>
<p>We rented the first floor of a medical facility in the same shape as the tower to gather us. The Sanatorium seems to be in the shape of a tower on this continent. It was as big as Sendia and rarely as powerful as Sendia, but it was large enough because it was originally used as a waiting room for patients.</p>
<p>However, the long chairs were difficult to move around, so they were used as they were. It was like sitting in a room similar to the waiting room of a large hospital on Earth, with serious-looking men sitting on their faces.</p>
<p>Somehow ridiculous, and desperate to hold back the laughs. Besides, the fact that these men barely had any say in this match was strangely surreal.</p>
<p>Sitting around here were representatives of a weak country that could not disobey the decision of a large country.</p>
<p>I guess he really was thinking of only informing us of the results later. But we couldn’t help but attend the meeting as a representative of the country, and he couldn’t doze off at all.</p>
<p>Some knights even had drowsiness by tying their thighs with serious looks on their faces.</p>
<p>There were probably only about a dozen or three people in total who raised their voices during the meeting.</p>
<p>Oh, and Fran had some say in it. Well, Fran wasn’t just an adventurer right now after all.</p>
<p>The current Fran was also treated as a representative of the Kingdom of Belios. She was also participating in the conference with Admiral Brunen.</p>
<p>The Kingdom of Belios itself was not as strong as the two major powers of the northern continent, but it was classified as a major power by the rest of the world. The national power was high and the navy was quite strong. Well, the navy has almost no work other than the dispatch to Gordisia once every few years. It seemed to be thought that they were stronger than they were actually because they were usually on Weena Rhyn. Besides, the Academy of Magic was in the country, and there was a very large number of military magicians. There was no doubt that they were a small number of elites.</p>
<p>And now, in addition to Fran, an adventurer with an alias, she was also an employer of the Dimitris school, led by a Rank A adventurer.</p>
<p>This time, they had not brought in much normal power, but they had a lot of high-ranking forces who could be active in the front line.</p>
<p>The Kingdom of Belioth was one of the five important countries in this conference.</p>
<p>Well, even so, it was not as good as the land of Snorabbit or the Demons under the strong queen herself.</p>
<p>Besides, Fran would move as a member of the Adventurer’s Guild when she makes any moves after this. Hiltoria and Zelos Reed are likely to do so as well.</p>
<p>Still, Brunen asked them to do something like that, so they acted as Belioth’s people. Considering their national interests, they would probably want to insist that their country had provided them with a great force.</p>
<p>The faces of the council also had William, Weena Rhyn’s disciple and muscular elf. He was a magic consultant, and it seemed that he was more important than we had imagined.</p>
<p>Basically, it was led by the administrative council, and the other organizations approved of it.</p>
<p>The action plan for the gathered forces was to create several elite groups and destroy the giants around Nocta. The other groups would mainly focus on scouting, gathering information, and providing support for the various places around Nocta.</p>
<p>There were no dragonkin from the northern settlement. It was not that they were not called, but that they did not accept the call. When the messenger arrived, the dragonkin from the northern settlement suddenly disappeared.</p>
<p>After all, they were probably under the command of the Dragon King. And it seemed that they were more likely to be involved in this incident.</p>
<p>Looking at the unit percentage announced after the meeting, of course, Fran was an elite unit. There were also other adventurers such as Mea, Hilt, Colbert, and Diggins.</p>
<p>They also had the Divine Sword-Hardening Nation of Silard and the Militant Nation of Hagane, as well as the dwarves, demonkin and their queens. They also had the names of the dragonkin Chelsea, the mercenary Tzaluta Camellia, and the knight Yagilale.</p>
<p>That may be a reliable face, but it also meant that their superiors believed they needed to have this much strength.</p>
<p>The usual strategy would be to send forces out from the area around the giant-type appearance and defeat them as many as we want.</p>
<p>However, this time it had taken three days to gather all their forces. They must have decided that hitting them with the smaller ones was meaningless. The council also thought that the giant-types they started moving were that strong.</p>
<p>『It’s going to be a easy job then』</p>
