</div><h1>Chapter 958</h1><p>A huge, life-like being suddenly appeared from under the earth. However, I still hadn’t got a full view of it.</p>
<p>Perhaps due to the dryness of the entire continent of Gordicia, the dust was so dense that it never cleared up.</p>
<p>Still, it faded a little and I managed to see what kind of shadow it was.</p>
<p>It was a huge antidemon. It looked very similar to a swordsman-type, though huge in size...</p>
<p>However, his appearance was quite different.</p>
<p>The huge antidemon was sitting on its knees, carrying its own knees. It looked as if it was sitting in a gym. Moreover, it was covered with a strange liquid that could be felt viscotically.</p>
<p>It looked like a baby in a womb, protected by a shrub. No, really, was it an antidemon baby? It felt incomplete, though...</p>
<p>「Isario, what’s that?」</p>
<p>「Uncle doesn’t know about that either. I’ve never seen that kind of big antidemon before. My past documents probably didn’t show any antidemons of that level」</p>
<p>So, this was a super-sized antidemon that we had never seen before. It had finally been proven that the antidemon season was not right.</p>
<p>「What should we do?」</p>
<p>「Of course, antidemons will be annihilated. Is that the only way?」</p>
<p>「Nn! Okay!」</p>
<p>Fran, holding the smaller form of Urushi, used the last of her strength to run to the sky at once.</p>
<p>If this man could not be defeated, no matter what anyone did, no one would be able to defeat him. In the first place, it was unthinkable that there would be anyone that Isario could not defeat.</p>
<p>Isario had said “I’ll destroy them”. If that was the case, then the destruction would be done. The envious father in front of us was, no matter what he said, that was all he could do.</p>
<p>『Fran, let’s make sure I don’t get caught up in Isario’s real attack』</p>
<p>(Nn!)</p>
<p>Fran must have believed Isario too. She nodded her head in agreement with my words.</p>
<p>「First, we’ll go near him. We’ll need some info before we take him down.」</p>
<p>「Okay. Urushi, let’s go」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>As soon as Fran jumped on Urushi again, Isario activated his magic tool board.</p>
<p>「I’ll do my best. Follow me?」</p>
<p>「Urushi, you shouldn’t lose」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>Amid the dust that still flew like a thin mist, Urushi and Isario’s magic tools advanced. I had thought that Isario’s magic tools were not very fast, but now they were on par with Urushi’s full speed.</p>
<p>Flames suddenly appeared from the rear of the board floating in mid-air, creating a tremendous acceleration. This was the same principle as Fire Magic’s Vernier, but I was impressed that she could keep her balance over such a long period of time.</p>
<p>「Antidemons are pouring in!」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Woof.」</p>
<p>There was nothing in particular that prevented us from reaching the giant antidemons at once, but...</p>
<p>Suddenly, a wave of magic power covered the surrounding area, and the presence of antidemons began to spring up. As the word implied, a large number of antidemons suddenly appeared in an empty place. They must have springed up all at once.</p>
<p>The dust made it impossible to get a full view of the Great Magic Beast, but I could tell that its presence alone was more than a thousand. Moreover, the wave of magic power had not subsided. It was thought that more and more antidemons would spring up in the future.</p>
<p>「Let’s just beat them up for now, okay?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Most of the antidemons in front of us were high-ranking black antidemons. I thought there were only a few of them, but I’m sure they were quite powerful.</p>
<p>But in front of Isario, she was no different from a lower class antidemon.</p>
<p>Each time he wielded Ignis, a wave of flames was created and swallowed the surrounding antidemons. At first, we slowed down a little, but we were quickly back to full speed. We pushed forward at full speed, destroying only the antidemons in front of us.</p>
<p>Without a chance for Fran and Urushi to leave, they dashed through the antidemon wall, clad in flames.</p>
<p>At the same time, a strong wind shook Fran from ahead, enough to make her squint. It was because the magic power emanating from the giant antidemons was releasing physical pressure on her.</p>
<p>However, thanks to the wind, the dust around the giant antidemons had been spilt, and we could finally see them completely.</p>
<p>「It’s huge!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Yeah, it’s pretty big to see it up close!」</p>
<p>Even Isario was looking up at that small mountain of antidemons and shouting in admiration. The antidemon’s huge body had so much pressure that even he was surprised.</p>
<p>Seeing it up close in a mysterious liquid that stopped right in front of it despite its gravity, I thought it was just like a fetal being.</p>
<p>Isario and Fran seemed to feel the same way.</p>
<p>「Antidemon baby?」</p>
<p>「I’ve never heard of such a being before... But it must be too big for a baby」</p>
<p>「Hmm...? My power is being sucked out of you」</p>
<p>『Me too!』</p>
<p>「That’s exactly what he did. He could absorb magic power from a wide area. It’s not just us. He’s also sucking power from the earth」</p>
<p>Isario was right. It seemed that the giant antidemons were absorbing a huge amount of magic power from the surrounding area.</p>
<p>However, they didn’t smoke me, Fran, or Urushi at all, and it seemed that Isario wasn’t being completely effective against them.</p>
<p>This kind of power was less effective the more powerful the opponent was. Although it was a huge antidemon that contained tremendous power, it didn’t seem to be overwhelmingly superior to us.</p>
<p>「It seems too dangerous to let this continue. I don’t know how long you’ve grown up」</p>
<p>「......So we’ll take them down now?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. I’m going to be a little flashy, so just move away a little」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Isario was using a technique that made him flashy on his own. I guess it was really dangerous.</p>
<p>『Fran, let’s go even further than last time』</p>
