</div><h1>Chapter 963</h1><p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>Fran stared with a wry expression at the vanishing giant antidemons.</p>
<p>I guess she was frustrated that she couldn’t defeat it with her own strength alone.</p>
<p>(...I still couldn’t defeat it)</p>
<p>『Can’t we still make full use of the Black Lightning God’s Claw?』</p>
<p>(Nn... difficult.)</p>
<p>At the moment of the attack, the convergence of the black lightning became unstable and scattered unnecessarily around the area.</p>
<p>As a result, the power of her attacks did not concentrate solely on the giant antidemons.</p>
<p>The same time we tried to do something similar before, we failed to converge the black lightning. It seemed to be very difficult to combine it with other techniques.</p>
<p>With Divine Beast Form or Potential Release, this was a power that could be easily manipulated, but it usually required tremendous concentration.</p>
<p>It would be difficult for Fran now to unleash such a secret art while moving at high speed and with a large number of skills in use.</p>
<p>I have a memory of the time when I was seriously transformed into a Divine Beast, so I was meaningless in my current state when I couldn’t control the Black Lightning as I thought I would.</p>
<p>They clenched their fists and looked down for a few seconds.</p>
<p>But this frustration wasn’t just her fault.</p>
<p>『To be honest, I failed a little too』</p>
<p>(Really?)</p>
<p>『Yeah, it’s pretty difficult to control the money expression and Divine Energy Manipulation...』</p>
<p>The gold medal skill was the new antidemon skill that Announcer-san had left me with. If I had been able to make better use of it, I might have been able to do more damage to the giant antidemons. No, I’m sure it was given to me.</p>
<p>I felt like I wasn’t proficient in using the money formula myself. The same went for Divine Energy Manipulation.</p>
<p>I’ll have to practice more of these two skills in the future. I also need Evil Domination.</p>
<p>If we could convert not only the fragments of the Evil Gods inside ourselves, but also the evil energy we absorb from the giant antidemons into magic and Divine Power, we would be able to convert it into two chickens with one stone.</p>
<p>I had used it on goblins and other substances during my travels, but I had never used it on someone of a higher rank. So, I’m going to use it more on this continent.</p>
<p>However, it was also thanks to the skill failure that the burden on my blade decreased.</p>
<p>If Fran’s Black Lightning God’s Claws and my skills had been in perfect control, my sword blade would have been in much worse shape. It was because we failed to cut its durability value by just a little more than half.</p>
<p>(More training is needed.)</p>
<p>『Yeah. But don’t push yourself too hard. Let’s keep doing it like we can』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p>『Besides, Fran has grown a lot』</p>
<p>(Really?)</p>
<p>『Yeah』</p>
<p>She didn’t even activate it when she failed to use the Black Lightning God’s Claw before. But this time, even if the damage was reduced by half, it was still active.</p>
<p>That was certainly growth.</p>
<p>Even so, a figure approached Fran, who still had a unhappy expression on her face.</p>
<p>「Oiiiii, young miss!」</p>
<p>「Isario.」</p>
<p>「What do you mean?」</p>
<p>「......Nn.」</p>
<p>Seeing Fran’s somber atmosphere, they must have realized that they were not convinced of the result. Isario patted Fran on the shoulder.</p>
<p>「Young misses always try to challenge themselves and make mistakes. Besides, thanks to you, I was able to make it easier for me too. Thank you.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Isario’s words were not the only one that comforted Fran.</p>
<p>「Young lady is amazing!」</p>
<p>「As expected of the Black Lightning Princess!」</p>
<p>「Whoa! Thank you very much!」</p>
<p>The adventurers who had picked up their lives were all cheering. They knew that Isario was not the only one who had saved their lives.</p>
<p>Fran smiled happily when she saw the men running toward her.</p>
<p>『We were able to protect Brutoria. So, let’s be happy with that for now』</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
<p>We returned to town with Fran, who had calmed down, and were still greeted by the adventurers there. Everyone watched closely at how Fran had healed.</p>
<p>They thanked us all, and those that we were close to expressed their gratitude violently by tapping their shoulders and heads. Fran accepted them, looking a little annoyed, but looking happy.</p>
<p>They were all happy about the victory for a little while, but soon Isario began giving them instructions. The adventurers went to look around the town.</p>
<p>As a result, several of the old men and people who had originally been weakened lost their lives due to the magic absorption of the giant antidemons, and many other people were safe. If they slept for a day, they would suffer from both magic exhaustion and evil sickness.</p>
<p>This was one of the few towns that had been hit by such an overwhelmingly powerful force. It was the result of the adventurers risking their lives to defend themselves.</p>
<p>A few hours after we defeated the giant antidemons.</p>
<p>The sun sets, and the curtain of night has enveloped the earth in Gordicia.</p>
<p>However, I couldn’t help but think that the sky was shining brightly in this area.</p>
<p>Isario was roasting the corpses of the people who had died.</p>
<p>Since the land on this continent was limited, cremation was impractical. Apparently, cremation was the most common practice on this continent. Moreover, there were no individual graves, but rather large graves for many people.</p>
<p>In the warm fire with the power of purification, my body melted as if it was vaporizing, and it became nothing but a bone. Then the bone gradually changed its shape and finally crumbled down like sand.</p>
<p>The bones were completely transformed into ashes, which were transported to the graves by the bereaved families and friends.</p>
<p>「Well, let’s see what happens next. I don’t know what will happen to the other towns」</p>
<p>「Nocta and Sendia, worry.」</p>
<p>「Well, I think it’d be best to go back to Nocta to get some information about him first. Will Miss Hilt’s wolf be able to run?」</p>
<p>「It’ll be fine. Even if Urushi gets tired... he can still fly with his sword」</p>
<p>「Aah, about that huh? If that’s the case, we’ll leave Brutori in the middle of the night and head for Nocta.」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>If there had been any giant antidemons in any part of the country, there might have been heavy casualties in some areas. Whatever the move, we needed to get the information out of them.</p>
