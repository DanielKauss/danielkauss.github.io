</div><h1>Chapter 984</h1><p>I quickly put up barriers, but at the same time, a tremendous explosion and roar attacked the second unit. The sphere-shaped antidemon dragonkin who had been thrown at it exploded at the same time. </p>
<p>「Guh......!」</p>
<p>『Fran! Are you okay!?』</p>
<p>(What the......!)</p>
<p> The shockwaves from all directions made it impossible for her to even move. I could see Fran’s skin charring in no time at all because of the high heat, which even a barrier couldn’t block. My blade was also frothing, and my durability was being cut down. My blade was also froth, and my durability value was reduced.  As I was healing Fran, I avoided the difficulty with Dimension Shift. I pushed myself too hard to intercept her, and it took me longer than usual to activate it.  Because of the flames and dust raging on the battlefield, I couldn’t check on the surroundings. The flames contained powerful magic power, which also blocked my detection with my skills.  I couldn’t even detect the presence of the supposedly close by Matsuyuki. I should have been able to knock off nine of ten of them at a distance, but the self-destruction of the ball-type antidemon dragonkin was too great. Within a 100-meter radius, they hadn’t been able to completely negate it.  There was only one direct hit, which was terrifying. If everything had exploded at close range, Fran and I wouldn’t have known what would have happened.  After about a dozen seconds, our field of vision finally cleared. However, Fran was left speechless and ran out.  </p>
<p>「Hmm...」</p>
<p>『This is terrible...』</p>
<p>  More than half of the soldiers of the Hagane Kingdom were lying on the ground, which had been greatly gouged and covered with rubble. The bodies of many of the fallen were charred, their limbs had been bent, and missing. When I looked at the physical injuries, I could see that they had clearly not just collapsed.  The damage was even worse than expected.  But it was thanks to Mastegi that they managed to survive. They must have just barely used Berserk’s power to kill the power of the explosion.  Therefore, some of the soldiers behind her were standing unscathed.  There was almost no damage to the adventurers against the heavily injured Militant Nation of Hagane.  Isario had used Ignis’s power to create a barrier. The flames must have been absorbed by the barrier, so the impact was canceled out. However, the remaining antidemons had been on the move during this time, and some of them were injured from being attacked while running inside the barrier. Most of the remaining antidemons were also eliminated by the explosion.  But this was not the end.  </p>
<p>『They’re coming!』</p>
<p>「!」</p>
<p> The human-shaped antidemon dragonkin were approaching the second division, which was still in chaos. Even without the ball-type antidemon dragonkin’s suicide bombardment, there were still ten human-type antidemon dragonkin alone that could kill us.  No, there were only eight of them approaching.  Urushi also pulled in two of them. Though they were battered considerably, they repeatedly provoked each other to their hostility. </p>
<p>『We can’t lose either!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  But how should we move? Isario was still using his Divine Sword open, but it would be dangerous to push himself further.  So, I’m not going to let the Great Magic Beast get any closer.  </p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>『Huh?』</p>
<p>  Suddenly, her field of vision changed and Fran was surprised.  But the most surprised was me. Why did I use teleport?  No, I know.  I obeyed the fear that suddenly welled up and fled. So much fear was rushing at me that I couldn’t help but feel. The source of the fear was a girl standing there, standing up with eerie magic power mixed of black and white. </p>
<p>『This is strange about how you look at Pine Snow...』</p>
<p>「The black and white magic power, Berserk?」</p>
<p>『It’s Berserk and his sheath!』</p>
<p> Black magic power was emanating from the pine trees and sword, and white magic power was emanating from the sheath.  Just watching her made me feel anxious as if I wanted to escape from this place. Fran seemed to feel the same way, and her tail was hanging and drooping.  Fran, who had continued to fight without running away from any enemies, was scared when she saw the two. The current Mastelier was that intimidating. Could it be that the Mad God’s Sword was about to be released?  That’s when Isario approached her.  </p>
<p>「Miss Hilt!  Let’s get out of here!」</p>
<p>  Isario shouted, creating a wall of fire between the antidemon dragonkin and the second unit. He was trying to escape from the Songpan Snow Mountain along with the adventurers. The fire wall was set up so that the antidemons wouldn’t get in his way and buy time to escape. Seeing this, Fran immediately began to move. </p>
<p>(Isario is in such a hurry.)</p>
<p>『Yeah!  Urushi!  See ya!  Come back here!』</p>
<p>(Woof?)</p>
<p>『Don’t worry! More importantly, hurry up!』</p>
<p>(W-woof!)</p>
<p>  Let’s call Urushi back with telepathy.  When this happens, we’ll have no choice but to escape.  As we turned our backs, we heard the voice of Mastegi.  </p>
<p>「Show me the right form of violence.  Crazy, break it, Berserk!Seeing this, Fran immediately began to move. </p>
<p>(Isario seems to be in such a hurry.)</p>
<p>『Yeah! Urushi! See ya! Come back here!』</p>
<p>(Woof?)</p>
<p>『We’ll be fine! More importantly, hurry up!』</p>
<p>(W-woof!)</p>
<p> Let’s call Urushi back with telepathy. When this happens, we’ll have no choice but to escape. As we turned our backs, we heard the voice of Mastegi. </p>
<p>「Show me the right form of violence. Crazy, break it, Berserk! Divine Sword Release!」</p>
