</div><h1>Chapter 931</h1><p>「Yeah, sure.」</p>
<p>『Fran, don’t be too overconfident, okay? You’re not at full power yet, right?』</p>
<p>「Don’t worry」</p>
<p>Fran was waving me in the yard of the tower.</p>
<p>『How about muscle pain?』</p>
<p>「I want to try it. But I’m fine」</p>
<p>Compared to Mea and Velmeria, the backlash was terrifyingly light.</p>
<p>Mea and Zefmate had decreased their stats and were unable to use Awakening. In addition, they seemed to be paying for tremendous muscle pain.</p>
<p>She couldn’t even get up from the bed on the first day after waking up. Aside from Mea, it was probably not enough for her because Zefmate screamed 「Ughyaah!」</p>
<p>Against Mea and Zelos Reed, Fran had already gotten up and started swinging her head.</p>
<p>『Yeah, and that toughness... I don’t think it was just because of her high status』</p>
<p>Considering that it was a backlash from forcibly turning into a Divine Beast with the help of Oracle, it would be very light. Well, considering how I’m calm, it wouldn’t be easy for me to stay in a coma for 10 days.</p>
<p>If she were alone, she would be defenseless for that while she was away, and she might starve to death. She didn’t react even if she smelled the curry, so she must have slept a lot.</p>
<p>The two had to pay the same price as Mea and Zelos Reed. Considering this, Fenrir and Zelos Reed had no choice but to be grateful.</p>
<p>Well, it’s not necessarily that they won’t be aware of the terrible cost――but it’s better to be more careful for a while.</p>
<p>Fran was now swinging her sword while withstood the muscle pain in her entire body. She wanted to check her condition, but it also seemed that she was trying to remember the feeling of when she became a Divine Beast.</p>
<p>Slowly, but one by one, he was seriously cutting invisible enemies.</p>
<p>The Divine Beast Form skill had already disappeared. It seemed that without the help of Oratrio, she wouldn’t be able to use that much power.</p>
<p>Fran muttered in a whisper.</p>
<p>「......There was awakening.」</p>
<p>『Yeah.』</p>
<p>「If I train, can I use it again?」</p>
<p>『Hmmm, I wonder?』</p>
<p>Divine Beast Form is a legendary skill that even black Heavenly Tigers can’t fathom. It is already close to fairy tales. I wonder if we can get such an phantom skill just by training?</p>
<p>It’s not just a matter of getting stronger, I might need some kind of special key. Yes, it won’t be that easy.</p>
<p>But Fran would not give up. With that power, she might be able to break the curse of the entire Black Cat Kin by herself.</p>
<p>After Fran found that hope, she couldn’t help but stop.</p>
<p>「Shh. Haaa!」</p>
<p>Fran was slowly swinging me as she tried to let the feeling of that time into her body. But she immediately looked down at me and tilted her head.</p>
<p>「Master, are you okay?」</p>
<p>She was wondering about my condition.</p>
<p>『Me too, Fenrir and Announcer-san saved me.』</p>
<p>「Yeah.」</p>
<p>『Yeah』</p>
<p>My compensation for the repairs was about slowing down. That said, I’ve improved a lot over the past ten days.</p>
<p>Thanks to that, we were able to keep an eye on Fran as she continued to sleep. But in return, Fenrir and the others went to sleep.</p>
<p>「I’ll thank you when Announcer-san and Urushi wake up.」</p>
<p>『Yeah, I’m sure he’ll love it』</p>
<p>Both Announcer-san and Fenrir were concerned about Fran. They would be happy to see Fran in her cheerful state.</p>
<p>On the contrary, I also had new powers. As for the King Wolf and Wisdom, I was only borrowing help from Fenrir and Announcer-san, so I couldn’t use them anymore after they fell asleep.</p>
<p>However, Mixed Slayer remained in the form of a gold medal, and new skills such as Evil Spirit Rush and Communication were newly acquired.</p>
<p>The Golden Devourer skill was brought about by the residue of Overgrowth, which was activated by the oratrio. And the Golden Devourer skill was re-orientated for us by Announcer-san. The Golden Devourer skill, which can inflict major damage to antidemons, would be very useful in our fight on this continent in the future.</p>
<p>Communication was a skill that made it possible for him to more accurately convey his intentions when he used shape change. I guess it was a skill version of the power of Fanatics.</p>
<p>I think Announcer-san had left it for me before I went to sleep.</p>
<p>And I wasn’t the only one who gained something. Fran and Urushi also had higher levels and stats.</p>
<p>Currently, both are level70, which is probably one of the top adventurers in the world by the looks of it. If it were an RPG, they would be able to challenge the last dungeon with leeway.</p>
<p>『In Fran’s case, her stats are getting pretty good.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>To my surprise, magic power and agility had increased by more than 300. Other abilities have also increased by more than 100 across the board. Along with this, HP and MP increased as well, finally breaking the 1,000 mark.</p>
<p>Apparently, it was due to the combination of various factors.</p>
<p>First of all, it seemed that stats would improve at once when it came to level 70% or higher. But I guess it would be incredibly difficult for the level to increase.</p>
<p>In addition to that, there was the effect of the Divine Beast Form. The skills had disappeared, but Fran’s experience with movement as a Divine Beastman must have enabled her to further enhance her body and senses.</p>
<p>Moreover, the part that did not appear in her stats was clearly improved in her handling of thunder magic. This was also a positive effect from the fact that she could manipulate the black lightning at will.</p>
<p>I hadn’t tried it yet, but I’m sure it could manipulate the black lightning better.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the effect of the title had an effect too. It was our newly acquired “Unreasonable title”. That was what made it so damn strong.</p>
<p>Mana Unreasonable: A title given to individuals with a certain level of power or higher who have fought on a battlefield where there were more than 300 thousand enemies for a certain period of time and defeated more than 30,000 enemies.</p>
<p>Effect: HP + 200, MP + 200, Strength + 100, Strength + 100, Agility + 100, and Magic + 100.</p>
<p>All of these factors combined to increase her status at once. Awakening will further enhance her, so she’s already at the higher echelons of Rank A.</p>
<p>Looking at the stats of the Beast King and Ashwrath, I thought it would be impossible for her to keep up. But I was pretty sure that the current Fran would reach him someday.</p>
<p>Mea and Velmeria had also received this title. However, it seemed that Zefmate hadn’t gotten it. Since it was impossible for them to believe that they had more than a certain amount of power after being turned into holy beasts, the number of antidemons must have reached them.</p>
<p>They were not very good at wide area attacks, and there were also times when they were completely focused on decoys and support.</p>
<p>「Urushi, you’ve gotten stronger too」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>At Fran’s words, Urushi, who had been eating the spicy curry as a reward, looked up. He raised his voice happily, making his mouth continuously flustered.</p>
<p>In Urushi’s case, his stats didn’t stretch as long as Fran’s, but even so, his stats had increased as he leveled up.</p>
<p>Also, Urushi has newly acquired a title that is powerful.</p>
<p>Inexhaustible Predator: A title earned by a magic beast that just ate on.</p>
<p>Effect: A bonus for all predatory activities.</p>
<p>The effect was a little vague, but that was why this title was so high in rank. It was the same as Extra Skills.</p>
<p>Perhaps this means that skills such as Predatory Assimilation are more effective. This was a very useful skill for Urushi.</p>
<p>「We can still be strong」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Fran clenched her fists as she said that. After realizing that she still had a high status, Fran was now burning with determination.</p>
<p>Well, his eyes were fixed on Urushi’s curry though. At first, I concentrated on my swing, but it seemed that I couldn’t hold myself back anymore.</p>
<p>Fran was also greedy for food.</p>
