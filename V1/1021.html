</div><h1>Chapter 1021</h1><p>Ashwrath, Mea, and Fran attacked the giant antidemons and attracted their attention. The giant antidemons, who had been ignoring us until a little while ago and were targeting our army, seemed to be something that Ashwrath could not ignore.</p>
<p>He attacked us right now.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, under Orfalve’s command, they were steadily making preparations for their counterattack. Jayne had planned to retreat earlier, but things had changed with Ashwrath’s arrival.</p>
<p>With him in the lead, we used all our forces to crush the giant antidemons. That’s how it was decided. After all, with the purple barrier, I now knew that we couldn’t escape.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, most of the high-ranking forces on this continent were concentrated in this area. The Divine Swordsman in particular were Ashwrath, Mea, Sophie, Adr, and Hydrangea. Well, Mea’s Lind and Hydrangea’s Berserk were not allowed to be released, and Adr was unable to fight either.</p>
<p>Even so, just being able to use two Divine Swords was quite an exceptional experience. In addition, Orfalve and Jayne, the Seven Sages that we had with great powers such as Hilt, Fran, Seliadot, Quina, Zefmate, and Chelsea, were also there.</p>
<p>What we did was simple.</p>
<p>First, Orfalve and Jayne formed a formation, and then Ashwrath disengaged from the decoy army, releasing Gaia to build up his power.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Fran and the others spent some time thinking about their deaths and left at Ashwrath’s signal. They unleashed Gaia’s most powerful technique on the giant antidemons, and if they couldn’t defeat them, all of the rest went all out.</p>
<p>That was what our plan was, but...</p>
<p>「Tch! The big monster has started to make strange movements!」</p>
<p>「Amazing magic power!」</p>
<p>The giant antidemon, which had been chasing after Ashwrath and firing magic bullets at him, suddenly stopped moving. He didn’t move.</p>
<p>However, I could see that a tremendous change was occurring inside. Both magic and evil energy increased in intensity, and were gathered further into the center of the body. At the same time, the amount of magic power flowing from the Abyss Eater increased.</p>
<p>It can be said to be doubling. However, it is being compressed in the center of the sphere from the edge of the Great Antidemon’s body.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just Ashwrath, we really went all out. I wished that we could interfere with the reduction of his magic power, but...</p>
<p>The outer shell crumbled and his body disappeared, but he could not damage the center of it. The compressed super magic power seemed to be acting as a barrier. Even the Earth Magic that Ashwrath unleashed was only slightly cracked. It must have been a blow from a transcendentalist like the Evil God Slayer that Adoll unleashed.</p>
<p>Realizing this, Ashwrath raised his Divine Sword and shouted.</p>
<p>「Divine Sword Release!」</p>
<p>Gaia’s figure changed into a strange form, like a huge hammer. The mana of the Earth Sword Gaia was visible up close, and I could tell once again how far the Divine Sword was going. There was a frustrating but reliable super weapon in there.</p>
<p>However, the presence emitted by the giant antidemons was not to be outdone by that divine sword. It was unlikely to be reassuring at all.</p>
<p>「Fran, get away! Doraaaaah!」</p>
<p>Ashwrath stepped forward and swung down Gaia. Even without the sword reach, an invisible force field attacked the giant antidemon.</p>
<p>The super huge body was crushed by force that could not be seen from above and slammed into the ground. The earth then sank deep into it, and even cracks a few meters in length ran around.</p>
<p>「Guh......」</p>
<p>「Uroooogh!」</p>
<p>Ashwrath clenched his teeth as he put more strength into his hands holding the sword. I could feel his hands and Gaia tremble, sometimes pushing back.</p>
<p>The giant antidemons, on the other hand, emitted high-pitched screams while releasing magical power into the surrounding area.</p>
<p>The super-gravity field maintained by Ashwrath distorted the scenery, and the super-high concentrations of magic power released by the giant antidemons were surrounding its huge body like lightning. The surrounding area had been turned into a dead area that no one could enter.</p>
<p>Then a huge explosion broke out.</p>
<p>The power of the two intensified, blowing straight into the air. Even Fran, who had been in a hurry to get some distance, was blown away by the blast.</p>
<p>I managed to catch Fran, who was still wriggling on the ground, with my telekinesis and healed her wounds with magic. Fragments of antidemons that flew like scattered bullets pierced through her barrier, inflicting wounds on her.</p>
<p>『Are you okay?!』</p>
<p>(...I’m fine.)</p>
<p>The damage was significant, but it seemed that it was not enough to knock her consciousness. Fran stood up slowly, wiping the blood around her eyes.</p>
<p>I could see that his friends, who had similar eyes to Fran, were still alive. But would Ashwrath, who was at the center of the blast zone, be okay?</p>
<p>『Ashwrath... You’ve taken not a single step!』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Perhaps they had put up a barrier, but the unharmed Ashwrath was standing on the ground, looking up to the sky and squinting his eyes. As I followed his gaze, I saw a point that looked like a grain of bean in the sky.</p>
<p>What they called it was the giant antidemons.</p>
<p>What a surprise, it seemed that it had used the release of magic power to jump upwards.</p>
<p>A huge crater had been created in the place where the antidemons were originally. The depth of the crater suggested that it was an explosion of power.</p>
<p>Did they just run away? No, that’s not the case.</p>
<p>「Guys! Get away from me! I’ll give it my all!」</p>
<p>Ashwrath shouted. Immediately afterward, the giant antidemons began to plunge. Behind them, the magic power released was shimmering.</p>
<p>It looked like a shooting star.</p>
<p>His way of thinking was probably the same as the Heavenly Sword Drawing Technique that Fran used. It was a super-powerful attack that combined the energy of both falling and magic release. While Fran uses slashes, the huge antidemons use their own weight to hit her.</p>
<p>Judging from Ashwrath’s impatience, the level of danger must be considerable.</p>
<p>『Fran, let’s get out of here! We’re in Ashwrath’s way here!』</p>
<p>(...Okay.)</p>
<p>I could feel the divine attribute mana erupting behind Fran, who nodded in frustration and rushed out. Ashwrath seemed to be planning to intercept her.</p>
<p>『We’ll have to get farther away from here!』</p>
<p>My danger detection skills continued to react in an extraordinary way.</p>
