</div><h1>Chapter 1087</h1><p>A chewy dragon panicker was swung down at the base of the dragon’s neck. </p>
<p>「Doooooaaaaaahhhh!」</p>
<p> Crack! The roar of a mountain dragon echoed through the air, and I could see a gunshot of a dragon flying through the air. The armor of the dwarves was shattered and battered. If we just slammed it against the ground, it would be in trouble, wouldn’t it? I wondered whether we should help them or not, but I saw Diaz running. This wasn’t the first time he had done something like that, so we could handle it if we leave that part to Diaz. This wasn’t the first time he had done something like that, and I think we could do something about it if we leave that part to Diaz. The mountain dragons, on the other hand, were in a terrible state.  A deep crater had been drilled at the base of their neck, with scales and flesh gouged out to the bones.  Even though these dragons have high life force, it was not the kind of damage that could be dealt with by laughing at them.  </p>
<p>「I’m feeling the magic stone!」</p>
<p>『Yeah! Don’t overthink it before it regenerates!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  Fran ran down into the sky and ran straight through it, trying to put a stop at the mountain dragons that were lying on the ground and moaning. </p>
<p>「Gyuoooh!」</p>
<p>  However, the mountain dragons were not completely neutralized. They roared as they gathered all their strength and turned their faces toward us.  An invisible shockwave then struck Fran. But I’m expecting something to happen. </p>
<p>『Doryaaaaah!』</p>
<p> I hit them with my wind magic to block out the shockwave, and I made my barrier thicker to pierce through the roar of the mountain dragon.  </p>
<p>『Fran!  Get closer!』</p>
<p>「Nn!  Taaaah!」</p>
<p>  Fran unleashed her all-out thrust. And at the same time, I extended my blade wide.  I pierced through the hard flesh that contained strong magic power, and my blade definitely caught the magic stone. A large amount of magic power was flowing into me.  </p>
<p>『Let’s take it!』</p>
<p>「Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!」</p>
<p>  Fran, who was exposed to the roar of the endemic beast, was blown away by it. It doesn’t do much damage thanks to the barrier, but I’m glad that she wasn’t careless.  My durability value has diminished considerably due to the combination of the Divine Attribute and Evil Conquest.  The recovery of my durability value does not progress very slowly. If I don’t use the combined use as a trump card, I might get hurt one day. However, something terrible happened before I could call on Fran.  </p>
<p>《The effect of self-evolution has been activated.  I’ve earned 100 self-evolution points》</p>
<p>『Huh?』</p>
<p>  You’ve just evolved yourself a little while ago, haven’t you?  So, this single mountain dragon was worth more than a thousand magic stones!? As expected of a dragonkin!  My self-evolution level has finally reached 20!  I’ve done it!  Fran!  You’ve evolved again!?  I was about to shout, but my voice did not reach Fran. But before that, my soul was summoned to a familiar place. I don’t know if it was in the mental world or the divine realm, but it was the white space that appeared when I met Fenrir.  I was slowly swaying in this endless white space that I couldn’t tell where to go, right, left, and right. I’m used to it, so I didn’t panic.  Time had passed when I got back to the other side anyway. It was a shame that I couldn’t share this excitement with Fran even right away.  </p>
<p>「Hey.  Master」</p>
<p>『That voice, Fenrir-san? You woke up?』</p>
<p>「It’s more correct to be awake」</p>
<p>  A black wolf appeared in the white space.  It was a black wolf. It was very similar to Urushi, but it looked more fearsome and Divine.  And it was huge.  I didn’t know what the size of it meant in this place, but it was big anyway. I was in my current form, but my eyeballs alone were larger than mine. From the tip of my feet to the top of my head, it was about 400 to 500 meters long.  I didn’t even feel the slightest hint of fear.  I wasn’t even surprised that it suddenly appeared.  It was probably because I knew that this person was my friend――No, she was half of her own.  But the next time she showed up, I couldn’t help but be surprised.  The three women were so beautiful that I couldn’t believe they were human. They were the Goddess of the Silver Moon, Goddess of Chaos, and Goddess of the Underworld.  </p>
<p>「Long time no see」</p>
<p>『Y-yes』</p>
<p>  What do you mean?  Until now, it was not possible for a Goddess to show up when she evolved herself. Sure enough, it’s a good twenty or so...  </p>
<p>「Congratulations. </p>
<p>『Yes?  Umm, you did it?』</p>
<p>「Yes.  Thanks to your growth, you have separated my kin from the Evil God’s soul. You have deep gratitude to me」</p>
<p>「In other words, you have accomplished your mission. You have done it well!」</p>
<p>「I didn’t expect you to do it in such a short time.  You have done your best so far.」</p>
<p>  A mission!  You’re on a mission like that!  No, you haven’t forgotten, right? It just took me a while to remember!  </p>
<p>「Master... Well, that’s okay」</p>
<p>『Fenrir-san!  It’s not like I really forgot about it! It’s just that I was too ordinary to be aware of it!』</p>
<p>「Fuhahaha!  I know!  I’ve been watching you forever after all. In fact, I can only thank you for your hard work」</p>
<p>『I-I hope so』</p>
<p>  Certainly, I didn’t expect </p>
<p>『I’m going to achieve my mission!』</p>
<p>. But it was true that I wished that Fenrir-san, who had been traveling with us, would be well-rested.  </p>
<p>「Now then, I will reward you for completing the mission as promised」</p>
<p>『Reward...  Eh? What is a reward...?』</p>
<p>  The reward I will be given for fulfilling my mission is certainly――. </p>
<p>「I’ll return your soul to Earth’s reincarnation」</p>
<p>「In the next life, you will live a life of talent and luck.」</p>
