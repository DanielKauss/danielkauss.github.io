</div><h1>Chapter 980</h1><p>The provoked dragonkin――no, they seemed to have been angry from the start because the boil was so low, but they attacked Isario with extraordinary anger.</p>
<p>Though their behavior was very fishy, their fighting ability was probably pretty impressive. All ten dragonkin were on par with Rank C adventurers. The leader and the one beside them looked even stronger.</p>
<p>In terms of strength alone, it would probably exceed that of a first-rate adventurer’s party.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, their equipment was not very strong. Originally, dragonkin boasted scales, so not many of them were equipped with heavy equipment. However, the equipment of the dragonkin in front of them was not that of a skilled warrior.</p>
<p>If they were an adventurer, they would be equipped by someone of Rank D or higher E. Not even a weapon of any rank would be strong.</p>
<p>Equipment that didn’t look like an elite, with such a low level of fighting speed. And yet, its status was very high.</p>
<p>What a gluttony army.</p>
<p>But no matter what kind of opponent they were, they were not Isario’s enemies. Even if he was still exhausted, I couldn’t imagine Isario losing.</p>
<p>Fran was not worried about whether she would win or lose, but that Isario might get tired again.</p>
<p>「Uwooooh!」</p>
<p>「He’s dead!」</p>
<p>「Hahaha, I don’t think that’s enough to kill you.」</p>
<p>「Come on! Come on!」</p>
<p>「Darya!」</p>
<p>「I’m yawning from being too big.」</p>
<p>Isario continued to dodge the dragonkin’s attacks, repeatedly provoking them. The dragonkin were already under Isario’s control.</p>
<p>The guys had blood in their heads so high that they hadn’t noticed it at all, but I could feel the surrounding temperature was rising little by little.</p>
<p>It would be too late if I felt something wrong.</p>
<p>After about five minutes, the dragonkin were completely paralyzed and immobile.</p>
<p>But that was where it started.</p>
<p>The dragonkin were still trying to move, even though they were clearly at their limit. Especially the leader of the group, a man who was still trying to fight in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>「Guh...... Ghaaah!」</p>
<p>「Y-You’re so reckless, huh?」</p>
<p>「Graaah!」</p>
<p>Spitting gastric juice from his mouth, he still did not stop. His eyes had clearly lost their sanity.</p>
<p>This was the first time I’d seen something like this.</p>
<p>We captured these dragonkin in the basement of Sendia. They showed a strange craziness when they were about to be destroyed, but I felt something close to them.</p>
<p>The Dragon King’s Dragon Domination skill must have been the reason for this.</p>
<p>Isario must have been planning to capture the dragonkin and interrogate them. However, none of them managed to stop them from rampaging when they were restrained.</p>
<p>Magic and life force kept dwindling, and eventually, all the dragonkin were out of breath. They were mentally manipulated to go berserk until their deaths.</p>
<p>「Uwaah, sorry. I was just trying to get them to tell me what they know.」</p>
<p>Isario apologized apologetically, but I’m sure everyone felt the same way.</p>
<p>「No. I’m afraid the Red lotus blade-dono isn’t a bad idea. There’s nothing I can do about it. They must have been manipulated in some way」</p>
<p>「You think so too? Dragonkin are more or less a race that has been looking down on others, but that’s terrible. They came from a stupid inferior race」</p>
<p>「Yeah, he didn’t even know about the Red lotus blade-dono either」</p>
<p>「Oji-san, you’re a celebrity after all」</p>
<p>Isario must have felt that the dragonkin were not normal. Well, even we could tell they were terrible too.</p>
<p>Frederick thought so, staring at the corpses of the dragonkin.</p>
<p>「Dragonman big brother, what’s wrong?」</p>
<p>「I recognize these dragonkin. They were probably low-ranking soldiers in the northern reservations.」</p>
<p>「...Is that a lower-ranked soldier? Is that really what you want?」</p>
<p>「Yes」</p>
<p>Isario looked surprised. He must have incited them to provoke, but he didn’t think they were really weaklings.</p>
<p>I was surprised too. A low-ranked warrior at that level? Even though he was as strong as a high-ranking adventurer? But I was sure that his equipment was of a lower level.</p>
<p>Then Frederick called out to Fran, Isario, and you. Apparently, there was something else she didn’t want to hear.</p>
<p>「...They might have used the Sacrament of the Dragon God」</p>
<p>「Are you serious?」</p>
<p>「Yeah. It was a magic potion developed by Trismegistus a long time ago that greatly improved the abilities of dragonkin. It was also thanks to that potion that I became this body」</p>
<p>「That wasn’t the ability of a half evil dragonkin?」</p>
<p>「That’s also true. More precisely, drinking and strengthening the Dragon God’s Sacrament has strengthened my abilities and allowed me to take in more Evil Spirits」</p>
<p>「I see. The medicine seems to be troublesome」</p>
<p>「It also has strong side effects though」</p>
<p>It is said to be a contraindicated medicine passed down to only a part of the dragonkin. The way it is made is known only to priestesses, and even their ownership is strictly limited.</p>
<p>The effect was to stimulate the dragon’s factor that was passed down to the dragonkin, and to permanently amplify their abilities. It was not a temporary type of dragonkin, but a permanent strength can be obtained by taking it.</p>
<p>These potions had tremendous effects on the dragonkin, since they made them even stronger when they weren’t leveled up.</p>
<p>However, the side effects were also tremendous.</p>
<p>First of all, half of them were refused the ability to transform their bodies, losing their lives immediately after ingestion. That alone was frightening, but it seemed that another half of them died a few days after their bodies transformed into strange forms.</p>
<p>That meant that if Frederick took the medicine, more than 70% of them would die. That meant Frederick being here alive was a miracle.</p>
<p>「This isn’t very broad-minded information, so if at all possible, I don’t want you to offend him」</p>
<p>「Okay」</p>
<p>「Of course. But they were originally low-ranked warriors, were they capable of withstood the side effects?」</p>
<p>「Actually, there are methods to reduce the side effects」</p>
<p>「Hou? Then why don’t you feel free to use it more casually?」</p>
<p>「No, that method greatly reduces your life expectancy」</p>
<p>The Sacrament of the Dragon God was just like a cup of boar liquid. Drinking it down activates strengthening.</p>
<p>So, what would happen if I took a few drop of it? With an enhancement of about half of what it was supposed to be, I didn’t have to die instantly.</p>
<p>After listening to that much, it turned out to be the best result.</p>
<p>However, there was a trap hidden there. By staying in a half-strengthening state, the burden on the un-strengthened part increases several dozen times, and as a result, their life expectancy is reduced. And they also lose their lives within ten days at the most.</p>
<p>The dragonkin who fought Isario lost their lives because they ignored the burden and continued to give it their all.</p>
<p>Under her brainwashed subordinates, Fran would definitely strengthen them to the point that they will lose their lives and fight them. The Dragon King is really a heartless bastard!</p>
<p>「The Dragon King......? Finally, we can’t let him go.」</p>
<p>Isario’s muttering also seemed to have newfound killing intent.</p>
