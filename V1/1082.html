</div><h1>Chapter 1082</h1><p>They brought Princess Miriam, the Selimean Princess who had removed her restraints, back to Barbra. They woke up on the way and were crying and happy that they were freed.</p>
<p>However, she must have immediately remembered her sister. On behalf of her, Selymea asked Fran about Marl.</p>
<p>Two princesses are sitting in the seiza pose on top of the giant Urushi’s fluffiness. It’s quite a surreal thing, but we’re serious ourselves.</p>
<p>「Where’s Marl now?」</p>
<p>「Mar has become a spirit」</p>
<p>「Huh? A spirit, huh?」</p>
<p>『No, I don’t get what they say.』</p>
<p>The princesses looked puzzled. Well, it couldn’t be helped.</p>
<p>In the first place, it was impossible to imagine a person being transformed into a magic beast and then a spirit. Even I don’t know why this happened. It must be the result of a combination of various miracles.</p>
<p>But soon, the princesses were forced to agree.</p>
<p>「Is this...... Mar?」</p>
<p>「What do you mean?」</p>
<p>Marl appeared in front of us. She didn’t hear me, but it seemed that she was talking to the Princess personally.</p>
<p>It was only about a dozen seconds before Marr appeared, but it seemed that both Selymea and Miriam believed Fran’s words.</p>
<p>「I thank you for making Marl’s wish come true」</p>
<p>「......Thank you.」</p>
<p>She bowed her head with tears in her eyes. However, Fran looked worried about where Marl had been.</p>
<p>『What’s wrong?』</p>
<p>(Mal, he was forcing himself to be very weak.)</p>
<p>『Is that okay?』</p>
<p>(She said she’ll sleep a little.)</p>
<p>The barrier of the water dragonkin had been lifted, and now it was so impossible for her to even look like the big sis. The spirit-looking Marle must have pushed herself too hard. She must have fallen asleep inside Fran.</p>
<p>Princess and sister were also worried, but they couldn’t do anything to help them since they couldn’t use spirit magic. In the end, all they could do was bow their heads to Fran and ask her to help.</p>
<p>Race: Ragnarok Wolf; Demon Wolf; Magic Beast</p>
<p>The aftermath of the battle with the fleet could be seen from Barbra, and he seemed to have been on guard. At the port of Barbra, a scouting group of adventurers, including Gamudo, was waiting for us.</p>
<p>I noticed Urushi on the way there, and there was a shout of welcome.</p>
<p>「Fran! What the hell’s going on! Those guys from Raydoss again?」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>「I see... Hmm? Who are those girls?」</p>
<p>「Hey, Princess.」</p>
<p>「Huh? Princess?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran rescued the princesses of Seedran from the fleet of Raidos Kingdom and explained that all of their enemy ships had sunk.</p>
<p>It was very difficult for me to explain about Marl and the fact that I used arcane magic to destroy a contract. I didn’t want anyone to know about him, and I didn’t want anyone to know about arcane magic.</p>
<p>I’ve asked the princesses to hold back. For me, this is where the arcane magic comes in. I just have to make a contract that says that we won’t talk about Fran if we don’t make a slave contract.</p>
<p>But Fran hated it. She didn’t even need to be enslaved to avoid a contract using magic.</p>
<p>Now that she mentioned it, we would have no choice but to trust them. She didn’t lie to me that I would never tell anyone, so I’m sure she’ll be fine for the time being.</p>
<p>I really wanted to have a good exchange of information with Gamudo, but I didn’t have time to relax here. Fran then pulled Gamudo a little further away and explained to him about the Kingdom of Shallus.</p>
<p>「That country, huh!? I’ve had a lot of problems at the Adventurers Guild too」</p>
<p>「The Chancellor is said to be a subordinate of the Western Duke of the Raidos Kingdom」</p>
<p>「Seriously! That country’s Prime Minister is famous for his abilities, but I never thought that he would......」</p>
<p>According to what we had heard before, the King was new and he looked a little incompetent. But in reality, it may have been controlled by the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>「They said they’d attack from the sea, but also from the Kingdom of Shallus」</p>
<p>「In other words, you don’t have much time left, do you?」</p>
<p>「Nn. I’m leaving.」</p>
<p>Fran was full of motivation, but Gamudo stopped her. But it wasn’t like they were asking her to stop because it was too dangerous.</p>
<p>「I’m coming too!」</p>
<p>「Are you sure about Bulbola?」</p>
<p>「The submaster and the feudal lord are here. This is a problem, isn’t it? It’s more important to always prevent an army from coming from the Kingdom of Shallus! Besides, we can’t be silenced like this!」</p>
<p>The last reason seems to be the most important, but Gamudo is not in a good mood. In fact, his experience on the battlefield was far superior.</p>
<p>「Get ready in ten minutes. I’ll bring it with me then」</p>
<p>「You’re right! Wait!」</p>
<p>From there, Gamudo’s actions were swift. He used adventurers as messengers, told everyone about the threat of the Kingdom of Shallus and the fact that he was heading for defense, and quickly obtained their approval. Well, he just shouted at the person who actually came to stop them and silenced them.</p>
<p>My equipment was in a battle mode, so it was already ready. As a result, I really completed my preparations for our departure in ten minutes.</p>
<p>「Here we go, Fran!」</p>
<p>「Nn. Riding on it」</p>
<p>「Excuse me. I’m pretty heavy, are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Even as we were climbed by Gamudo, with his entire body armor covered with a huge hammer, Urushi didn’t seem to get freaked out. He then jumped into the sky with the same movement as usual.</p>
<p>Gamudo smiled excitedly as he saw that.</p>
<p>「Even a Wyvern can’t fly long distances with me! That’s a high-ranking magic beast!」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>As we made our way through the sky, Gamudo gave us instructions.</p>
<p>「If we wanted to enter the Kingdom of Kranzel from the Kingdom of Shallus, there was only one way. The rest was quite steep and not suited for moving large armies. We’ll definitely pass through it」</p>
<p>「Okay」</p>
<p>「If at all possible, we don’t want to invade the territory of the Kingdom of Shallus. If we fight in our country, we will have an advantage in the aftermath」</p>
<p>Gamudo made a map and told us where he was headed for the battlefield. It was a barren wasteland extending from the south-eastern part of the Kingdom of Kranzel. The army from Shallus had certainly passed, and there were no towns or villages on Kranzel’s side.</p>
<p>「Intercept them, here.」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
