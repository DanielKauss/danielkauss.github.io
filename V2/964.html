</div><h1>Chapter 964</h1><p>Fran and Isario moved through the night and arrived in Nocta. Well, Fran was sleeping on me along the way, so Isario was the only one who stayed all night. At first, Urushi tried to do his best, but he got pushed too hard by the move to Brutori, and soon he got off the hook. So, I continued to fly in the sky with Fran on my telekinetic air ride. I’m getting strangely used to it while I was supporting Fran as she sleeps standing. Right now, I might even be able to keep my futon on top of it. This also meant that I’ve grown a lot. This also meant that I was still growing. Even so, it was difficult for us to keep up with Isario, but we managed to reach Nocta without being late.  There were signs of a tremendous battle left outside the town.  Some areas were large, like depressions on the ground, and others were burned black over a wide area. Some parts of the city were reddish-black due to bloodshed.  Many adventurers were lined up on top of the walls, giving the impression of tension. After all, there was probably a battle with giant antidemons here as well.  As we approached the gate, we saw a group of adventurers gathered. They were apparently trying to inspect the walls and deploy them to keep an eye on antidemons.  Then, we found the faces of their acquaintances.  </p>
<p>「Zehard!」</p>
<p>「Huh?  Young miss!」</p>
<p>「Nocta, are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, it’s all thanks to the dwarves and demonkin.  Nadia-san is safe too. The phenomenon of absorption of magic power never reached that far away.」</p>
<p>  Fran’s shoulders relaxed when Mulsani’s escort adventurer, Zehard, heard about Nadia’s safety. She must have been worried about Nadia.  Even though she was worn out, she was still Nadia, a high-ranking adventurer. Even though she knew that she wouldn’t die from exhaustion of magic power, she was worried until she actually checked her safety.  </p>
<p>「Isario!  Fran!  You’re safe!」</p>
<p> After separating from Zehardt, Fran and Nadia were now called out to Replare, the guildmaster who was in charge of the command.  </p>
<p>「You too.  Did Nocta have any big monsters too?」</p>
<p>「Yeah.  Fortunately, I was able to defeat it with the help of dwarves and demonkin... But what about the damage to Brutori?」</p>
<p>「The town itself was just safe.  However, there were casualties to the adventurers and residents」</p>
<p>「I see... We suffered a lot too...」</p>
<p> In Nocta, Jayne, the Queen of Demons, and Orfalve, the Queen of Dwarves, led the way to annihilate the antidemons.  The dwarves responded to the antidemons gushing out from the iron wall, and the demonkin magicians used their ritual magic to weaken the huge antidemons. Finally, the two queens attacked and destroyed the huge antidemons.  In Nocta, the ground tremor was apparently even greater than Brutori’s because of the appearance of a huge antidemon right next to the town. The buildings and other structures were often destroyed, and the damage from that disaster didn’t seem to be ridiculous. </p>
<p>「The damage situation in various places is gathering more and more, but Sendia has apparently suffered very little damage.」</p>
<p>「Is that so?」</p>
<p>  Fran was most interested to hear.  She took a one-sided beatdown of Replare’s words.  </p>
<p>「Yes, I’ve heard a report that the residents of the town and the holy knights of Silard had collaborated. The giant antidemons were defeated by the Beast King’s daughter and the Divine Sword Knight Adoll, right?」</p>
<p>  Or rather, she noticed it after the report.  Did those guys from Silard make their way to Sendia?! Originally, there was a promise between Filuria, the Medical Director, and Addler that she would hand over the saintess.  Even stories about Sophie being a Divine Sword user have spread throughout the town, and there’s a high possibility that Addler’s ears will hear about her. If so, maybe they would use whatever they want to take Sophie away......  But is Sophie safe?  Since Mea was a Divine Sword user herself, Velmeria had once turned into a Divine Dragon. If Silard discovered her, she might be subject to kidnapping.  </p>
<p>「...... I’m going to Sendia!」</p>
<p>「Oi oi, what’s the matter with your sudden change?  I’ve heard that Sendia is safe, you know?」</p>
<p>「Addle, the Divine Sword Knight, is after Sophie. She might be forced to go with her.」</p>
<p>「About that.」</p>
<p> Of course, we’ve heard about Filuria in the Adventurers Guild too.  But Seliadot, the Ward Dealer, had already captured her, so she must have been unaware of her presence.  Since she blurted out the details of her Divine Sword, the guild didn’t fully understand the importance of Sophie. They didn’t care much about whether or not the Holy Nation of Silard was heading to Sendia. </p>
<p>「Maybe it’s just right then.」</p>
<p>「What do you mean?」</p>
<p>「We were going to have you guys go to Sendia.」</p>
<p>「Really?」</p>
<p>「Yes.  The administrative council on this continent has decided to send a request to all adventurers and countries to provide forces.  They will split their forces into several groups and defeat the giant antidemons――the giant antidemons that are still around.」</p>
<p>  Although it does not have a definitive authority, the administrative council has the power to make requests to maintain the barrier on this continent. The government and the guild have no obligation to obey.  It is only a request to do so. Therefore, the requests of the council must actually be obeyed.  </p>
<p>「Of course, the Adventurers Guild will make urgent requests to all adventurers. You’ll also be asked to follow them, okay?」</p>
<p>「Well, that can’t be helped then」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>  As long as you’re an adventurer, you can’t refuse it. But it’s only natural that we would have to do so in case of an emergency. </p>
<p>「So, the administrative council wants to make sure that the Holy Nation of Silard, the Militant Nation of Hagane, Snorabbit of the Dwarf Kingdom, and the Kingdom of Dom Demons are all part of it」</p>
<p>  Two countries possessing the Divine Sword, and two countries that have the Seven Sages as their kings. They were, of course, the strongest forces on this continent.  </p>
<p>「The Queen has given us permission to do so.  The Militant Nation of Hagane will send emissaries to Silard. So, I’d like you all to go to Silard.」</p>
<p>「Why are you going with us two?」</p>
<p>「To be honest, aren’t we idiots?  And we’re only thinking about ourselves. So I have to negotiate with them so that they can’t refuse me after swirling around for some strange reason, right?」</p>
<p> I guess he meant intimidating them with Isario and Fran and forcing them to accept Silard’s offer.  If Isario were the only one, they would be on par with Ader.  The holy knights might have the advantage over Silard.  So, with Fran here, their forces would be more than five minutes long. The other side wouldn’t want to try anything by force, after all.  No normal country would do anything stupid, but Replare seemed to be willing to give it a shot. That was a person who understood her appraisal of Silard.  If we took Silard to the battlefield here, we wouldn’t have time to waste in Sendia anymore.</p>
<p>(Nn.)</p>
