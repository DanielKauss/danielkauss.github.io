</div><h1>Chapter 929</h1><p>After listening to her explanation, Quina had a look of astonishment on her face. Well, I didn’t expect a normal person to know this, but as I was reading Fran’s expressions every day, I was able to understand the expressions of the same type of Quina. </p>
<p>(So you believe that Saintess Sophilia was the wielder of the Divine Sword?)</p>
<p>『Yeah. I never thought that the identity of that harp called Lauda was the Divine Sword, Oratrio.』</p>
<p> I never thought that the identity of that harp was the divine sword, Oratrio.』</p>
<p>  However, according to the information I’ve seen before, the divine swords Chariot and the Adventurer were not in the shape of swords.  Chariot was a commander’s staff, and Adventurers were even more like a monocle. The weapons that Divine level blacksmiths had trained are called Divine Swords as a customary practice, but their shape may not be that of swords in many cases.  </p>
<p>(Are they awakening their abilities through magic songs enhanced by the Divine Sword...? That doesn’t sound like a slight enhancement)</p>
<p>『Yeah, you’re amazing.  Our Fran had a skill called Divine Beast Form, and Mea was in a state of White Beast Form. Besides, Lind was also fully awake as a Divine Sword』</p>
<p>(I didn’t know how great the backlash was, but...  He doesn’t seem to be small.)</p>
<p>  Quina muttered and looked worried about Mea falling asleep. She must be thinking about Mea even though she was spitting out her poison tongue all the time. Unlike us, who rarely suffer from the backlash thanks to Fenrir and Zefmate, we don’t know what will happen to Mea and Zefmate.  We asked her about something that had been bothering us.  </p>
<p>『Where was Quina? She seemed to have been acting separately from Mea for a long time』</p>
<p>(It would be fine for Master-san. I was investigating the slavers’ organizations.)</p>
<p>  Mea and Zefmate’s goal was to investigate and destroy the beastmen that lured into the slavers. The conspicuous Mea and Zelos Reed probably checked out the Beastmen Union, while Quina, who was good at stealth, was in charge of investigating behind the scenes. </p>
<p>『Did you know something?』</p>
<p>(Yes.  Despite the commotion, some of their members were also captured. Like I thought, the blue cat organization was behind it.)</p>
<p>  Apparently, the slavers worked behind the scenes, using adventurers, citizens, and merchants as fronts. Since they had been active for a long time, they had been paying attention to various places.  </p>
<p>(They don’t do anything flashy, move first and foremost to avoid suspicion.  They only capture slaves when it’s unlikely to break, such as the antidemon season. That’s probably why they have been hiding for many years.)</p>
<p>  However, the current strengthening of the Beast King’s crackdown had brought about a major change in the organization. Several of the routes for selling slaves had been crushed, forcing them to open up new routes. The lack of information cloaking on those new routes had made Quina’s organization seem to have arrived.  </p>
<p>『What is the new route?』</p>
<p>(It’s through the dragonkin to the Raidos Kingdom.)</p>
<p>  I’ve heard stories of the Raidos Kingdom buying slaves. It’s probably because there are many uses for it, such as experiments and miners.  Even Fran might have been sent to Raidos if she hadn’t met me. His flashy moves have affected the continent of Gordisia, and the black market slavers are becoming unable to hide their traces. </p>
<p>『Hey, can you tell us what you think about the illegal slavers?』</p>
<p>(Fran-san was a former illegal slave too......)</p>
<p>『Yeah. We’re still following the black market slavers, but it’s gonna be hard for us to get any good info on them.』</p>
<p>(It’s fine.  We thought we would need to expand our forces to reach the top brass of the organization.  Instead, we’ll need your help.)</p>
<p>『Of course. But still, are you sure you’ve already gotten what’s going on with the top brass?』</p>
<p>「Yes, but we’re not quite sure where they are though. We already know who they are.)</p>
<p>『Who?』</p>
<p>(They are dragonkin who call themselves the Dragon King.)</p>
<p>『Dragon King Georg!』</p>
<p>  I never thought we’d hear his name again! </p>
<p>(They used the forces of the dragonkin to forcibly take over an organization that was originally dominated by blue cats.  Did Master-san have any information on the Dragon King?)</p>
<p>『Yeah. He tried to use his dragonkin to destroy this city.』</p>
<p>  I told her about the evil crystals I found underground and the danger of them. Then, Quina said something surprising. </p>
<p>(There were other crystals that emitted that evil spirit too.)</p>
<p>『What? Are there other ones in Sendia?』</p>
<p>(Yes.)</p>
<p> Quina and the others found the underground room where the evil crystals were placed and destroyed it. They deposited the evil crystals with their collaborators.  </p>
<p>『Are your collaborators working for the Beast King?』</p>
<p>(No, they’re adventurers known as warders.)</p>
<p>『So Seliadot is Quina’s friend?  This is really her!』</p>
<p>  Seliadot’s kin is protected in the Beast Kingdom, and they have a business relationship with her. It was by chance that Seliadot had come to see her this time, but she was willing to help.  Quina gave us a light explanation of her situation.  </p>
<p>『Lorelei......  That survivor......』</p>
<p>  Her circumstances were somewhat similar to those of the Black Cat kin. I’m sure her resentment toward the illegal slaves was the same as Fran’s. Seems like Seliadot had been gathering information on the illegal slavers and reported this to the beastmen’s country before. Sophie said she had no clue where Seliadot was going, but she and Quina had been protecting the town in secret.  Since she could sense where her wards were, she could use that information to find any suspicious basements. Moreover, the information they obtained through the dragonkin interrogation was more complete than ours.Moreover, the information they obtained through the dragonkin interrogation was much more detailed than ours.  Quina, the Beastmen of the Beastmen, was able to put them into hypnosis and retrieve their information.  </p>
<p>(It seems that the self-proclaimed Dragon King actually has special powers.)</p>
<p>『Divine Dragon Form?』</p>
<p>(No, that’s not it.  I’ve heard that he has two attributes.)</p>
<p>  The Dragon King is said to be an evil dragon as well as a fire dragon.  Therefore, he must be able to manipulate evil crystals. Since those with multiple attributes are treated in a special way, it seems that Georg was not allowed to self-proclaim himself as the Dragon King. The Dragon King also said that his onslaught this time was the work of the Dragon King.  He apparently planned to use his men to gather the antidemons around him in Sendia and destroy them. </p>
<p>『Yeah.』</p>
<p>(It’s definitely the work of the Dragon King’s men.)</p>
<p>『I see......』</p>
<p>So it’s the Dragon King who made Fran the slavers, huh......?  I’m sure they’ll be on my kill list number one.  No matter what happens to them, they’ll kill them. Never.  </p>
<p>(Master-san!  Even though you’re a sword, don’t show any killing intent! Fran-san and Urushi will nightmare.)</p>
<p>『Oh, sorry.』</p>
<p> It seems Quina had become a little impatient because of her killing intent.  </p>
<p>『Quina, info on the Dragon King.</p>
<p>『Kukuku...』</p>
