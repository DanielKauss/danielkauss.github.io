</div><h1>Chapter 925</h1><p>「Ruaaaaaaaaah!」</p>
<p>「Siiii! Sigii?!」</p>
<p>「Haa! Teyaa!」</p>
<p> The battle between Fran and the three horned dragonkin had entered the realm of divine speed. They fought against each other at a speed so fast that no one could even see their shadow in front of them. Though they were evenly matched at first glance, the tide of battle was turning in Fran’s direction. It may not be easy to say that she has mastered the use of Divine Beast Form, but it still outmaneuvered some of the world’s strongest class antidemons. It may not be easy to say that she mastered the use of Divine Beast Form, but it still outmaneuvered even the strongest class of antidemons.  Fran evaded the three- horned swords swung at super high speed and accurately struck her own slashes. The number of times she slashed increased at once, and soon Fran continued to slash one-sidedly. No matter how high the regenerative power of the triangular horns was, its regeneration quickly became unable to catch up with the black lightning and slashes imbued with Divine Attributes.No matter how high the regenerative power of the triangular horns was, they were quickly rendered incapable of catching up with the black lightning and slashes imbued with Divine Attributes.  The triangular horns were slid apart by more than a hundred slashes over a protracted period of time.  Its flashing multiple sword lines looked like an insect cage made of a sword.  </p>
<p>「Phew.........!」</p>
<p>  Fran paused with a rustling sound as if her actions had signaled her to stop. As if their actions had been a signal, the three horns collapsed and scattered slender bodies on the ground.  But they hadn’t been defeated yet.  I saw the remains of antidemons desperately trying to move. If we leave them like this, they will regenerate and start moving sooner or later.  As expected from a unique at the very top, they were as resilient as Castel’s twisted horns. In front of the antidemons, Fran thrust her right palm toward them.  As if in response to Fran’s concentration, the magic power cloaking them was transformed into black lightning, raging around the area. And then, a large amount of black lightning gushed out and gathered in front of Fran’s palm, contracting.  Soon after, a jet-black sphere created by the concentrated black lightning floating in the air. It was a jet-black sphere that looked like a small black hole. It wriggled so violently that it looked like it could burst, and it was making a high-pitched sound.  The intimidation and presence of the black lightning sphere was so strong that even I could tremble.  If it went out of control, the whole area would disappear? But Fran didn’t even seem to feel uneasy at all and let go of her power with a calm face.  </p>
<p>「Black Tiger Lightning Rush!」</p>
<p> Rather than hitting the ball of black lightning, it was as if she was releasing the black lightning she had stored in her storage at once.  The extremely thick black lightning that suddenly appeared pushed forward, engulfing not only the three horns but also the antidemons around them. The torrent of black lightning became like a river and carved deep and long wounds on the plains.  From a distance, it looked like a really black dragon was rushing in.From a distance, it looked like a really black dragon had dashed into the area.  The ditch, nearly twenty meters wide, continued far into the distance. In addition, the black lightning scattered around it also wiped out the antidemons around the scars.  It was tremendous power.  Was it the Black Tiger’s Lightning Rush?  I guess that must be the secret technique of the Divine Beast, Black Heavenly Tiger.  </p>
<p>「Damn...」</p>
<p>『Yeah, I mis-distributed its power』</p>
<p>  She had used too much power, which she was unfamiliar with, to its full strength. Even with the power of Sophie’s song, it was going to take her a while to recover to her combat ability. So slow that it was strange that she didn’t collapse.  </p>
<p>『But, you did well.』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  Fran used up all of her strength, but I can still fight. She had used a lot of power to withstand Fran’s divine attribute, but it won’t be a problem if she just scattered her magic.  She had intended to cover her comrades with a long-range attack――but Urushi’s strong gaze refused to help.  The long horned, crimson giant lion faced us. A little over five meters long huge body was running around the battlefield, chasing after each other.  It seemed that Urushi wanted to end the battle on his own.  He seemed to be burning a rivalry with an enemy who was walking on four legs the same level as him. Urushi could beat them in terms of magic power, but in terms of simple physical ability, he was superior to the horned lion.  As they bit each other and wielded their claws, the horned lion’s attacks landed a direct hit on Urushi many times. In close combat, they seemed to have a share of their opponent.  However, Urushi did not stop challenging himself to engage in super close combat. The two rolled around while intertwining, and many antidemons were caught in it and disappeared. Then the battle suddenly ended.  </p>
<p>「Grrrrrr!」</p>
<p>「Gyii――」</p>
<p> Urushi thrust his fangs deep into the neck of the horned lion, and the paws that he slammed went all over its torso.  It was the effect of his Dusk skill. The reason why Urushi insisted on close combat was to keep the darkness of dusk on the horned lion.  After being debuffed by the dusk for a long time, the horned lion’s status and armor continued to weaken. As a result, his attacks, which had been lightly wounded up until now, were fatally wounded and defeated.  This was exactly the strategy of slashing its bones by slashing its flesh.  The horned lion, whose limbs had been shattered, was swallowed by the darkness of Urushi’s magic. Its presence had completely disappeared.  </p>
<p>「Urooooom!」</p>
<p> Urushi’s roar echoed through the battlefield.  </p>
<p>「Urushi, did it」</p>
<p>『Yeah!  You’ve done your best!』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  As Fran approached the knight, she lightly patted his leg, and Urushi barked proudly.Her tail was waving merrily, causing a strong wind.</p>
