</div><h1>Chapter 1075</h1><p>Fran stared at the sleeping Fran as if she was dead, but she must have immediately realized what was going on around her.</p>
<p>About 70% of the villagers had escaped from the square, but the old man and those injured were still unable to escape. They seemed to be surprised by the sudden situation as well. I appraised them just in case, but they were all ordinary villagers.</p>
<p>Fran started to move with a look of fatigue on her face.</p>
<p>I was born several decades ago, it seems. Not that it means much to me considering how I don’t remember living that long myself.</p>
<p>『Fran, are you okay? If you don’t want to move, you can just sit back, you know? The people in the village are going to do something with my doppelganger』</p>
<p>「...I’m fine」</p>
<p>『Yeah, I think we know what our next objective is』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran broke the restraints on the villagers’ limbs and healed them with recovery magic. The villagers thank her very much, but she couldn’t seem to be happy with it.</p>
<p>The villagers’ gazes on Fran were not so gentle as to what she was sleeping in. Well, it was only natural. However, because Fran was keeping her eyes on them, no one was willing to take action.</p>
<p>The villagers who remained in the plaza must have known that Fran and Fran were acquaintances.</p>
<p>However, the villagers returned, probably understanding that the commotion in the plaza had subsided. Some of them didn’t even know what was going on, and even tried to run as soon as they saw Fran. Fran then stood in front of them.</p>
<p>「W-What the hell!」</p>
<p>「......I’ve caught it, so it’s my prey. Don’t let yourself get caught.」</p>
<p>「T-That’s――」</p>
<p>「Stop! What are you doing to my savior!」</p>
<p>「That’s right! You pitifully begged for your life at first, but you still are amazing to a child!」</p>
<p>It was the villagers who stopped them. Some were really grateful to her, others thought that they couldn’t afford to offend her when they saw Fran fighting.</p>
<p>Also, the village chief’s shout, “We need to think about the future first!” managed to suppress the confusion for the time being.</p>
<p>Apparently, it was also a good thing that there were no deaths among the villagers. They seemed to have understood that this girl was not an enemy as Fran was healing the villagers.</p>
<p>The first aid work was over, and the villagers were starting to calm down. After confirming this, I gave Fran instructions. Fran summoned the village chief and suggested that she should escape from this village.</p>
<p>This village, which had been targeted by both Raidos and Philias, was in quite dangerous condition. That would be terrible for the villagers who had just been released, but they should have evacuated to the town.</p>
<p>Again, there were people who wanted to stay in the village, but in the end, all of them agreed to move. Unlike the fishing village we stopped on the way from Barbra, the actual damage was caused by the Great Magic Beast, so the enthusiasm of their families was different.</p>
<p>The Metelmam group, which Fran had stored the food in the village’s warehouse and departed the same day, moved very slowly, but managed to get away with it because there were few magic beasts around.</p>
<p>We had to move for a few hours. We must have been about halfway down the mountain road, since we were able to see ourselves from a distance. We had left it for a while, but it kept coming back.</p>
<p>『We might have to deal with this first』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran told him to take a short break in an open area and leave alone after covering the surroundings with earth magic walls. No, maybe two, since they were carrying Fran with them?</p>
<p>Since we were not very far away from the village, we could easily find out what was going on with the villagers.</p>
<p>He must have sensed that Fran was approaching, but the owner of the presence refused to run away. Then, Fran landed in front of him.</p>
<p>「I knew it, Satya...」</p>
<p>「Fran-san...」</p>
<p>That’s Satya for the one who ordered the surveillance.</p>
<p>He had a complicated expression on his face as if he was crying, so there was no hostility on his face. But there was a strong sadness on his face.</p>
<p>「Are your wounds all right?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, something like that.」</p>
<p>The wounds still affected Ronowe, but they managed to cover up the wounds. Fran and Satya smiled at each other awkwardly.</p>
<p>「You’re right...」</p>
<p>「...Frut, I’ll return it」</p>
<p>「......Are you sure?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Fran handed Fran to Satya. I think it would be a good idea to give it to the country or the guild, but that would probably bother Fran... Since it was impossible to expect everyone to say something like that, the country might get disappointed. I wonder what should we do then.</p>
<p>Satya, who had received unconscious Fran, tilted her head in confusion.</p>
<p>「Out. The life magic beast.」</p>
<p>「......Here.」</p>
<p>「I’ll check on your condition then」</p>
<p>「Yeah」</p>
<p>What emerged from Satya’s shadow was a demon that looked like a chimpanzee with bat wings. The demon gave us a momentary look of fear. Could it be the effect of killing them?</p>
<p>But even so, in just a moment, she immediately put her hand on Fran and began to send magic power. She was using a combination of recovery magic and life magic. I can tell that Fran’s condition was a little better.</p>
<p>At the same time, he seemed to be scrutinizing Fran’s insides. He reported Fran’s condition to Satia in a hoarse old man’s voice.</p>
<p>「I can hardly sense any power from you.」</p>
<p>「What do you mean......? You’ve not disappeared, haven’t you?」</p>
<p>「It’s just in time, but if I leave it like this, it might disappear in no time at all」</p>
<p>Our recovery magic was able to heal Fran, but it probably didn’t even reach the Demon Lord.</p>
<p>「Sorry...... but we failed to protect Frat.」</p>
<p>Fran then explained the whole story to him. I was worried if he would believe that I had absorbed the knife to kill the demon, and that it was the work of the Raydoss agents――.</p>
<p>「......I believe. I did the same knife the other day.」</p>
<p>Apparently, the Kingdom of Raidos had prepared a trump card for Phyllius. Last month and last month, two demon knights lost their lives.</p>
<p>However, Satya told us that the Royal Family of Philias had retrieved both of them. If they hadn’t found several knives from the failed divine sword, would the Kingdom of Raidos have the ability to mass-produce failed swords?</p>
<p>「It was originally a magic sword passed down through the generations of my royals.」</p>
<p>「Did Filias have a sword to kill demons?」</p>
<p>「Yes. I heard that it was a trump card to deal with the Great Magic Beast sealed in the Divine Sword that went out of control. But it was stolen from the treasury many years ago...」</p>
<p>In other words, there was a magic sword that paired with the Demon Lord’s sword, Diabolos, that was sealed with the power of a demon killer. But was it robbed by Raidos and analyzed?</p>
<p>I don’t know the details, but I’m sure the Raidos Kingdom succeeded in mimicking the power of the magic sword. With the know-how of the Pseudo Fanatic Sword and the magic sword to kill demons, wouldn’t it be impossible?</p>
<p>Satya hugged Fran tightly and began to cry from time to time.</p>
<p>「During her appearance, the connection between the magician and the demon is strong. I heard she’s aiming for that...」</p>
<p>Demon killer doesn’t become a fatal wound if it was just a summoning or even a possession. Even if the demon is lost, the damage to the caster is less.</p>
<p>However, since all of them were now the same body, the curse of killing demonkin would even kill the magician.</p>
<p>「It is a miracle that your old man was saved this time. Thank you, Fran-san」</p>
<p>Satya thanked her, but Fran still had a complicated expression on her face. I guess it was because she regretted that she had more ways to go. Perhaps because of this, she told her about the magic stones so that she could be fooled.</p>
<p>「...The magic stone in the village has been destroyed」</p>
<p>「It was Fran-san after all. The curses have stopped flowing, so I thought it might be a mistake.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Satya bowed her head again to Fran, who nodded at her.</p>
<p>「Thank you very much」</p>
<p>「...Why」</p>
<p>「You have saved our country after all」</p>
<p>「But......! I......! Both Fran and Satya tried to cut!」</p>
<p>「It’s us and the Kingdom of Raidos that’s wrong. You’re not doing anything wrong. Don’t worry」</p>
<p>I think he’s a dog-type because of those ears?</p>
<p>There was no lie in Satya’s words. She was concerned for Fran even though her older brother was badly injured and she had been slashed. Fran seemed to feel more sorry for her now that she understood that.</p>
<p>「Even your old man will be sad if you’re bothered」</p>
<p>「...I’m sorry」</p>
<p>「......Both you and I are grateful. We were just picking up innocent people for our country, but you stopped us.」</p>
<p>I think Fran and Urushi were unconsciously holding back. If they had really been so cold on the villagers, we would have had a chance to kill them even if we had protected them.</p>
<p>The fact that she didn’t do that probably meant that deep down she hesitated to kill the villagers. Perhaps the first time she gave the bandit to the Bloodfang Brigade was to be prepared to kill them.</p>
<p>「You have saved the people from the village, the people of our country, and my brother. I can vouch for that. So don’t cry, okay?」</p>
<p>「......Nn.」</p>
<p>The two girls were both guilt-stricken, but they hugged each other with tears in their eyes. The only thing we could do was to watch over them quietly.</p>
