</div><h1>Chapter 947</h1><p>Isario was just continuing to defend, but the antidemons kept on defeating him.</p>
<p>As I observed it, I was trying to use all my senses to assess the trick.</p>
<p>Then I realized it.</p>
<p>The insides of the antidemons had become extremely hot.</p>
<p>Apparently, the internal temperature was rising little by little and was being burned from inside. Humans would probably be hit by intense pain that would make them fall around, but antidemons without pain receptors could keep fighting until they die.</p>
<p>I don’t think this is an efficient way of fighting against antidemons... No, it seems the antidemons don’t notice any abnormalities inside themselves because they don’t have the pain. Isario must be glad that they don’t have to worry about letting them escape.</p>
<p>Another three minutes later.</p>
<p>Isario was completely encircled by a swarm of antidemons. Surrounded in all directions by more than ten thousand enemies, he was being attacked endlessly. Are you going to keep on defending it and slowly burn it down?</p>
<p>The high fever probably defeated about 500 of them, but there was still a long way to go. I was sure we would win at Isario’s level eventually, but it was too easygoing.</p>
<p>As I watched Isario’s battle with doubt, I suddenly felt something approaching us from behind.</p>
<p>There was no sign of life, I faintly sensed something with mass slicing through the wind and coming towards us.</p>
<p>If we hadn’t been on the lookout for this battlefield, we would have been much later to notice it. We hurriedly turned around, thinking it was some kind of long-range attack.</p>
<p>Then, there was something unexpected in it.</p>
<p>It wasn’t an attack, but a person. No, it was an opponent in the form of a person.</p>
<p>She had white skin and silver hair. It was more like she was in perfect condition than a beautiful woman. I couldn’t feel any presence or emotions coming from her.</p>
<p>The one approaching us was the Silver Lady, a golem created by the divine blacksmith Zechs.</p>
<p>She stopped instantly in front of us, not sensing inertia, and started talking in a flat voice without changing her expression.</p>
<p>「Long time no see.」</p>
<p>「...Nn. Do you need anything?」</p>
<p>「Yes. I had something to tell you, and I was looking for it. But I have more things to give priority to now」</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>「It’s best to leave this place as soon as possible, you might get caught in Ignis’ attack」</p>
<p>「!!」</p>
<p>Immediately after the Silver Lady shouted a warning. The red sword, which stood out from the distance, emitted an intense light. It seemed that it had released the Divine Sword.</p>
<p>A red flash of light shone through the wilderness, and a torrent of magical power with physical pressure blew the antidemons away.</p>
<p>When the raging red light subsided, Isario had a clump of flames in his hand.</p>
<p>「Is that the real form of Ignis?」</p>
<p>『Yeah, I guess so...』</p>
<p>Isario had a clump of flames in his hand, about the length of a long sword. It was a divine flame, but it looked much different from the other divine swords that were released.</p>
<p>However, the strength of the sword was exactly worthy of the name of the Divine Sword.</p>
<p>Even at this distance, it was already hot. Moreover, I could see that the temperature around it was rising rapidly.</p>
<p>『Fran! Just like the Silver Lady said, this is bad!』</p>
<p>「Nn. I’m leaving.」</p>
<p>「I think it would be better to do that」</p>
<p>Following the Silver Lady who had started moving ahead, she distanced herself from Isario. Even after nearly 200 meters, the Silver Lady did not stop yet.</p>
<p>Another 200 meters later. Then finally, the Silver Lady stopped flying.</p>
<p>「You have to get this far away?」</p>
<p>「Yes. It doesn’t mean that the impact will be completely eliminated here too. But considering the past data, this is not a problem at this distance」</p>
<p>「Have you ever seen Isario’s Divine Sword many times?」</p>
<p>「I have been observing the large-scale battles taking place on this continent as much as possible.」</p>
<p>As part of their support for Overgrowth’s wielders, they were constantly gathering information on antidemons and other strong men.</p>
<p>Isario was one of the strongest people on this continent who had been fighting on this continent for many years. Naturally, the battle data he had gathered was enormous, and I had seen the power of the Ignis, the Brilliant Flame Sword, many times already.</p>
<p>Therefore, it seemed that a certain level of prediction was possible.</p>
<p>「They use themselves as bait to gather antidemons and use Ignis’s power to defeat them all at once. Isario of the Red lotus blade will use this pattern with a high probability of success in annihilating them」</p>
<p>She looked down at the battlefield, listening to the Silver Lady’s explanation. There, we saw a crimson light swirling around, covering the entire battlefield.</p>
<p>It may look beautiful at first glance, but inside, it was hell.</p>
<p>The Divine Flame released by Ignis swallowed the antidemons and disappeared one after another. Before we had time to turn into ashes, the antidemons disappeared as particles immediately after they were touched.</p>
<p>It was far more powerful than the Great Magic Beast. The red circle within a radius of nearly 100 meters melted the earth and antidemons, and the heat released was burned over an even wider area.</p>
<p>The temperature around Fran increased, and she was starting to sweat a little on her forehead.</p>
<p>Certainly, it was too close to before. If it hadn’t been for the barrier, it would have been burned. I wouldn’t have killed it, but...</p>
<p>This was the Divine Sword. After staring at the burning earth, we realized once again the tremendousness of the Divine Sword.</p>
<p>Fran opened her mouth while looking down at the earth, which had turned red with a fever and was slowly melting.</p>
<p>「By the way, you said that you wanted to tell me something?」</p>
<p>「Yes. Give me some advice」</p>
<p>「Admonition?」</p>
<p>「Please be careful with Silard. He will certainly be a nuisance if he is known to be useful to his country」</p>
