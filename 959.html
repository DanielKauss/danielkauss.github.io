</div><h1>Chapter 959</h1><p>Fran hurriedly moved away from Isario and watched over him as he faced the giant antidemons. Perhaps confirming this, I saw red mana rising from Isario. Flames erupted from Isario’s body as if to follow the gush of mana. The burning flames swirled violently as if to intimidate the surroundings, and then converged on Isario’s right hand. In his right hand, a mass of flames shone bright crimson, just like the one we had seen before. In his right hand, a mass of flames shone with a crimson glow, just like we saw before.  The antidemons who had broken through the middle of the road caught up with us, but just by getting closer to Isario, they flared up and disappeared. A reasonably strong black antidemon was just like a moth swarming around a bonfire.  </p>
<p>「A Divine Sword...  It’s amazing」</p>
<p>「Woof」</p>
<p>『Yeah』</p>
<p>「And Isario is also a Divine Sword user huh?  I guess he’s just something that shouldn’t be normal」</p>
<p>  He looked the same bad dad, but his presence was overwhelming. Not only was he using a Divine Sword, but Isario himself, who used that Divine Sword, was shining brightly.  He was not inferior in strength to the giant antidemons facing him.  </p>
<p>「Isario, you’ve made a move」</p>
<p>『Just in case, don’t let your guards down so they can escape at any time, okay?』</p>
<p>「Nn. I know.」</p>
<p>  I don’t even know if he’s safe in a place where we are. That’s how magical he is.  He looks more serious now than when he faced more than 10,000 antidemons. I look at the giant antidemons as my only opponent.  The fact that they are still immobile is probably a big factor. It is even possible to unleash the power of a powerful divine sword after all.  </p>
<p>「Haaaah...  Phrgh...」</p>
<p>  With Isario’s breathing, Ignis, the radiance of the Brilliant Flame Sword, on one hand, increased. The glow was as strong and violent as the sun, and it even made Fran want to narrow her eyes lightly.  I’ve seen the higher-level flame magic that Velmeria, who had been manipulated by Fanatics, had unleashed at the royal capital before. At that time, I compared the intense flames to the sun. However, the intensity of the glow that Ignis now wore was probably much stronger than the flames of that time.  The center of gravity of Fran and Urushi tilted slightly back.  I was unconsciously preparing to escape at any time. And Ignis, wrapped in such a brilliance that even a human eye could not see, swung down from the top.  I see, he was not talented, wasn’t he?  When I thought of it as a slash, the attack Isario unleashed was a decent blow. It must have reached the level of Sword Saint Skill, which is said to be an expert.  But it was not an attack that would show his talent. Ignis must not have the ability to grant Sword King Skills.  However, it was a slash that showed a huge amount of practice and obsession for the sword. The polite movement that he had acquired as a result of his training was precious. He knew the limit of his power, and that was why he was putting all his power into a single blow in good faith.  Indeed, Isario’s own power may have no point in terms of the attack power of the Divine Sword.  Maybe it was originally only a 100,000 attack power. Maybe it wouldn’t be a problem if the swinging down was more clumsy and appropriate. But even so, I think it was because she was able to unleash such a sincere blow of the Divine Sword that Ignis approved of Isario.But even so, I think it was because she was able to deliver such a sincere blow from the Divine Sword that Ignis approved of Isario.  Isario’s mental strength, which allowed him to understand the power and weight of the Divine Sword and continue to make efforts without drowning, was worthy of respect.  Fran’s gaze seemed to also be filled with awe.  I guess it was the same feeling as me.  A ray of light shook us below us.  It was so blinding that the flames turned white. Over a hundred meters of flame blades had cut through the huge antidemons, creating a deep gash in the earth beyond.  </p>
<p>「Good, good, good, and good!」</p>
<p>  The huge antidemons, which were cut in half on the left and right, screamed tremendously. How could I put it simply as a scream when they screamed high in the air? It was so loud that Fran and Urushi in the sky then covered their ears.  Is Isario okay?  His voice, which had covered the surrounding area over a wide area, was already a sonic attack.  However, that was, as I thought, a Divine Sword user. He didn’t seem to have taken any damage and was standing there leisurely.  </p>
<p>『I’m done』</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>  The flames rose from the cut section cut open by Ignis and devoured the entire body of the giant antidemon. Before anyone could utilize the regenerative power of the high-ranking antidemons, the huge body of the building turned into ashes in a short amount of time and disappeared.  I don’t know what purpose that huge antidemon was created.  Was it something that created it, or was the antidemon’s own will? However, there was no doubt that it was not complete yet.  I don’t know why it appeared on the ground, even though it looked defenseless. Was it okay to get hit by a few attacks, or was it difficult for it to become even bigger underground?  At the moment, there was no sign of attacking the surroundings. No, under normal circumstances, that magic power absorption ability was probably a one-sided attack and defense that allowed the enemy to dry up and grow themselves. That was what kind of existence they were.  However, they were too bad. I don’t know how big their magic power absorption is, but there was nothing I could do when I faced the owner of that destruction.  </p>
<p>「Isario, call me」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  They must have judged that it was over completely. Isario was waving his hand towards us.  When we came back to him, the heat around him was tremendous.  It was probably because of the aftermath of his attack that Isario was on this continent because he didn’t have many people on Ignis. In this land of death, even if you change the terrain a little, it won’t be a big problem.  </p>
<p>「Are you okay? </p>
<p>「Hahaha, I think you got a little serious.」</p>
<p>  As Fran was worried, Isario seemed to be exhausted.  He was sweating on his forehead. It seemed that it was not enough for him to be able to walk, but it seemed to be quite a pain.  However, that was not the only thing that Fran was concerned about.  </p>
<p>「... You won’t be paying the price?」</p>
<p>「Oops, you’re a very well-informed person.  It’s okay. Uncle, since you’ve been using a Divine Sword for a long time now.  I know intuitively how much it would cost me to use it」</p>
<p>「Then it’s fine」</p>
<p>「Well, I’m not going to complain about the fact that I can unleash so many attacks with Level 1 or 2」</p>
<p>  It seemed that the price of Ignis was at a level.However, that was not the only thing that Fran was concerned about. </p>
<p>「...So the price should be fine?」</p>
<p>「Oops, you’re a very well-informed person. It’s no problem. Uncle, since you’ve been using a Divine Sword for a long time now. I know intuitively how much it would cost me to use it」</p>
<p>「Then it’s fine」</p>
<p>「Well, I’m not going to complain about the fact that I can unleash so many attacks with Level 1 or 2」</p>
<p> It seemed that the price of Ignis was at a level. Fran didn’t seem to want that, but I was able to get it out under the guise of a familiar wind.</p>
