</div><h1>Chapter 1045</h1><p>『We’re finally on this continent, huh?』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>A few days have passed since the battle against the giant antidemons.</p>
<p>After completing all the aftermath, Fran――well, Fran had done very little, but she was now back at the western port. Her employer, Brunen, was stunned by all the surprises, but he said it was the best result of all.</p>
<p>At first, we planned to hunt and train antidemons, but we also wanted to talk to Trismegistus after visiting a grave...</p>
<p>It turned into a huge adventure, several times larger than I had expected.</p>
<p>Being a Divine Swordsman and one of the Seven Sages, she had met knights from various countries and various people. That made me, Fran, and Urushi a few degrees stronger than they had originally planned.</p>
<p>「Long time no see on the ship.」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>Fran stared at the harbor from the ship’s deck as she squinted her eyes in response to the sea breeze. In less than an hour, she was planning to set sail for the continent of Zilberd.</p>
<p>『We’ve done all the greetings and exhausted all our antidemon points.』</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>Antidemon points can’t be taken out of the continent, or to be more precise, they can’t be used outside the continent, it’s something like a virtual currency that’s only available on the Gordicia continent.</p>
<p>No matter how much we hold, it would be meaningless if we left Gordicia.</p>
<p>Well, I guess it was a measure to keep adventurers on the continent of Gordicia as long as possible. It could not be used on other continents, but it was a limited currency that could be played around freely in Gordicia.</p>
<p>Well, I guess that’s why it would be difficult for her to move away from holding so much of it.</p>
<p>I don’t know what will happen to this system in the future. If the number of antidemons were to decrease for almost thirty years, lesser adventurers would not be able to earn money. The cycle of living with points must break.</p>
<p>Trismegistus’ warning also had no effect on the city. There was no way everyone would leave immediately, but there was a strong tendency that the weak should not be allowed into the continent.</p>
<p>The topic had already been discussed at the meetings, and there was repeated discussion about whether residents, low-ranking adventurers, and fledgling soldiers should be allowed into the continent.</p>
<p>That means we might have to change the antidemon point system itself in some way. Well, I’d have to ask the higher-ups to think of it that way, and we’d just use it up. Since we couldn’t give it away, we’d have no choice but to use it.</p>
<p>What we bought with points were mainly building materials such as stone. We had provided them to the towns affected by this incident.</p>
<p>No, I didn’t come up with any other ways to use it. After all, there was no point in keeping a large amount of it in their possession. It must be food or medicine.</p>
<p>But we needed more residents of this continent than we did. We couldn’t buy everything up to cause chaos, and if we were to stock up and give it away on our own, some of them might find it difficult to distribute it.</p>
<p>After much thought, they decided to pay a reasonable price for the building materials that were normally difficult to carry.</p>
<p>We’ve stocked up on such a large amount that people would mistake us for building a castle.</p>
<p>As we handed them out, we also greeted the people who had helped us.</p>
<p>We had Replare, the guildmaster, and the Dandy submaster, who were troubled with the guild’s progress. Kozon and the other adventurers who went with us to rescue Nadia.</p>
<p>Mea, Quina, and the rest of the Beast Kingdom were busy working for the beastmen on this continent.</p>
<p>The hydrangeas of Militant Hagane staying in Nocta had no choice but to stay in step with the Holy Nation.</p>
<p>Drulay, the rabbit beastman who had become Fran’s boss, and the rest of the underworld.</p>
<p>Chelsea, the dragonkin we fought with, and Tzaluta, the mercenary. Ashwrath was trapped deep in the continent to quell his onslaught.</p>
<p>Everyone bid their farewells to Fran. We had asked her to stay on this continent for the time being, but Fran refused all of that.</p>
<p>That’s because we were asked to send Brunen, her employer, to the continent of Zilberd. Besides, Fran’s goal of lifting the curse of the entire Black Cat kin couldn’t be achieved on this continent, and I couldn’t grow myself either because I didn’t have any magic stones.</p>
<p>「Fran, you took good care of me」</p>
<p>「This is your chance to come to our country」</p>
<p>「Orfalve, Jayne.」</p>
<p>Two queens appeared with almost no companions. They came all the way here to see us off. They shook hands with Fran as she disembarked from the ship and worked hard for us.</p>
<p>「When you see Garrus, tell him that you greeted me.」</p>
<p>「Nice to meet you.」</p>
<p>Come to think of it, they were Garrus’ stepmother-in-law and Jean’s actual mother. I had forgotten about her because she was so young. Starting with these girls, we saw them off one after another.</p>
<p>「Fran! Let’s go!」</p>
<p>「Velmeria, are you sure you want mom?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, Frederick is with me.」</p>
<p>Velmeria was the one who casually called out to us. It seemed that our friendship had been further strengthened by our fight together.</p>
<p>「I’m sorry about that skill...」</p>
<p>「At that time, it couldn’t be helped. Besides, It was only a burden on me. In fact, I was grateful」</p>
<p>We had talked to her about the Divine Dragon Form that we had taken from her. Well, I couldn’t bring it back, so I just came to the conclusion that it was inevitable.</p>
<p>I was prepared to be resented more, but Velmeria didn’t seem to care. I hope I can give it back someday...</p>
<p>「Lady Fran!」</p>
<p>「Isario, are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Oi oi, that must be a lot of words. I’m saying goodbye to the young miss.」</p>
<p>I’m sure he was busy with aftermath, but it seems he came all the way to see us off. Fran realized that and bit happily. I think she missed him a lot.</p>
<p>「Aunt Nadia, did you know Isario?」</p>
<p>「Just in case. Oops, sorry Isario-dono.」</p>
<p>「No, you’re sick, right? It’s better not to push yourself too hard」</p>
<p>At the same time as Isario, Nadia and Mulsani came to see us off, but they seemed to know each other. Even though they had never had a conversation, they seemed to know each other, the strong that fought on the continent.</p>
<p>Isario was assisting Nadia, who was still unable to walk properly.</p>
<p>「Fran. Thanks for letting me use this sword.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>I gave Nadia, who had lost Overgrowth, a magic sword I had taken from Rezalua, the dragonkin elder. This was probably just the right weapon for her on her way to the Beast Kingdom.</p>
<p>「You’re so reckless, aren’t you?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「We’ll meet again soon!」</p>
<p>「Fran-dono! Be careful!」</p>
<p>「Thank you very much」</p>
<p>Adventurers Diggins, Yagilale, and William the Muscle Elf also came to greet us. We had a lot of connections here, and I can see that in action.</p>
<p>『We’re about to set sail. Brunen is calling on us.』</p>
<p>「Nn... It’s getting closer」</p>
<p>「Fran, don’t cry」</p>
<p>「Hilt......」</p>
<p>Hilt, who was leaving this continent together, wiped Fran’s tears away. Colbert and Phobos were with her too. They had lost a few disciples, so they must have felt something.</p>
<p>Still, an adult should be able to afford to be concerned for Fran.</p>
<p>「......! This song!」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>『Yeah!』</p>
<p>Sophie was standing at the end of the harbor wall, staring at the passing ship and playing a harp. That song I’ve heard many times.</p>
<p>「An adventurer’s song...」</p>
<p>Sophie’s performance must have reached the adventurers who had come to see her off. They then started singing without a trace.</p>
<p>The circle of songs spread not only to the seers but also to unrelated people who were at the harbor. Everyone seemed to be having fun just singing.</p>
<p>「Don’t lose...♪ Keep going...♪ Show them your pride...♪」</p>
<p>「Stand up! Come on, this is our chance to show them what we’ve got!」</p>
<p>「Show them what you got!」</p>
<p>「We’re with you!」</p>
<p>「We are adventurers~...♪」</p>
<p>「The golden adventurers~...♪」</p>
<p>A large number of tears fell in the corners of Fran’s eyes as she heard the great choir, and a song naturally overflowed from her mouth.</p>
<p>「We are adventurers~」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>「Yeah, gonna be an adventurer~... Fugh.」</p>
<p>Fran hugged Urushi and buried her face in his fur. It seems that she was wiping her tears.</p>
<p>「Guys, see you again...」</p>
