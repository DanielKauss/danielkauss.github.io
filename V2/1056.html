</div><h1>Chapter 1056</h1><p>Leaving Urushi to handle the situation, Fran and I then headed for the port of Barbra. It had been destroyed considerably. Raidos Fleet had focused their shots on the main facilities. However, many of the normal facilities and houses were surprisingly safe. I could see many people coming towards us, perhaps noticing the strangeness of the stop of the barrage. At the front of them was a familiar presence. </p>
<p>「Over here.」</p>
<p>『Yeah, let’s head out as well.』</p>
<p>『Yeah, let’s head out as well.』</p>
<p> A few minutes later, we ran into a group of adventurers.  </p>
<p>「Fran!  Fran Kat!」</p>
<p>「Gumd!」</p>
<p>  was led by Gumd, the former Rank A adventurer and guildmaster of Barbra. They seemed to be safe. Well, I don’t think a simple bombardment would be enough to take care of this man.  </p>
<p>「What happened to them!  Besides, who are they?」</p>
<p>「Those guys from Raydoss...」</p>
<p>「What!」</p>
<p>  The three of them, who were dragging Fran in a scout state, turned out to be from Raydoss, and the gang’s killing intent overflowed.  They must have understood that their enemy was the fleet of Raydoss. Well, they were also raising their flags. Fran also gave the information she obtained from the men to Raidos Kingdom and deposited it with them.  </p>
<p>「Can I ask them to do this?」</p>
<p>「Well, we don’t have any hope for you, but what are you planning to do with Fran?」</p>
<p>「I’m going to an orphanage」</p>
<p>  I felt a little rushed because I was worried about what was going on in the orphanage.  But Gamud smiled and told me that.  </p>
<p>「You’ll be fine then, you know? I was there just a moment ago after all」</p>
<p>「Really?」</p>
<p>「Okay.  I went to see see them, but they were all safe.  After all, there’s an underground escape room that Amanda made with all her might. It should be safe as long as we don’t shoot large scale magic directly in.」</p>
<p>「I see...  I’m so glad」</p>
<p>  If Gamud pushed her to the beat, she should be really okay. Fran stroked her chest down with a relieved smile.  </p>
<p>「There’s still an enemy ship left in the harbor.」</p>
<p>「What!? Are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Nn.  Urushi is watching over them.  Besides, all Raydoss’s ships have sunk. Seedran’s ship is still there」</p>
<p>「Aah― , I see...  I wonder what’s going on...」</p>
<p>  The first surprise attack had destroyed the ships of the Barbra navy, and the crew members were also badly injured. They didn’t even have the strength to capture and take over enemy ships.  </p>
<p>「But we can’t leave them unattended either. I’d be grateful if you could use them with us」</p>
<p>  On the other hand, if we could incorporate Seedran’s ship and its crew members into our forces, it would be a good compensation for Barbra’s lost forces. I don’t know how the Raidos Kingdom will react in the future, but it should be fine if it had more than a little of its forces.  </p>
<p>「Who’s the new feudal lord?」</p>
<p>「... He’s an excellent politicalian, but not much of a battle... I’d be grateful if you could transfer your power to my husband in Kraiston, but how about a deal?」</p>
<p>  He is not incompetent, but he doesn’t seem to be very good at fighting. I guess the civilian-looking feudal lord has been sent to rebuild Barbra.  However, Fran could do nothing about that. We had no choice but to leave it to Gwad and the others.  </p>
<p>「... Fran.  It will be a pain, but you can help us take the ship away. We’ll give you a good reward」</p>
<p>「... Okay」</p>
<p> I’m also curious about the orphanage, but we can’t leave the harbor and Urushi unattended either.  It seems they already decided to take care of this problem first. With Gumdo and the others in the lead, she began to turn back the way she had come. </p>
<p>「Sorry, but I’m not very good at the sea.」</p>
<p>『Oh, you’re a dwarven, huh?』</p>
<p>  I’ve heard that dwarves were a race that could not swim.  Even Gumdo seemed to find it difficult to handle them at sea. I guess that’s why he can be twin-minded in land battles.  </p>
<p>「Fran, you’re talking?」</p>
<p>「Nn?」</p>
<p>  For some unknown reason, he was whispering in Fran’s ear. He’s having ears above his head, so he can whisper without crouching. He said that his beard, which was characteristic of dwarves, tickled him when it hit him. </p>
<p>「You’re your rank」</p>
<p>「?  B, but...」</p>
<p>「Well, I know.  I’m not talking about rank-ups.」</p>
<p>  Gamud said so and pulled Fran a little farther away from everyone. He must have been careful not to be asked by other adventurers.  </p>
<p>「It looks like you have done a lot of work in Gordicia. Your rank-up recommendation has been made.」</p>
<p>「So you’re going to rank up?」</p>
<p>「That’s not going to be easy. In your case, it’s because you’re a very special person.」</p>
<p>  Simply too young.  Moreover, you’ve been an adventurer for less than two years.  Even though you’re strong, it’s not like you’ve been given too much special treatment. Besides, it was still difficult to determine the most important part of her personality and aptitude.They also said that there would be some doubts about her achievements this time.  There were many cases where there were no witnesses, and some were wondering if she really had made a great achievement on the battlefield where there were several Rank S adventurers and Seven Sages.  Isario also brought up my case and reported me, but that was why there were subtle gaps or even scenes in which Fran could not be fully active.Isario also brought up the subject and reported me, but that was why there seemed to be a slight gap between us, or rather, there were times when he couldn’t say that Fran had been active.  </p>
<p>「To be promoted to Rank A, you will need to have a visible achievement and the approval of your country.  To be honest, I think there’s a high possibility that we’ll be seeing her off this time」</p>
<p>「Yeah」</p>
<p>  There was not much frustration on Fran’s face as she nodded casually. Gumdo seemed to have noticed too.  </p>
<p>「Why?  You’re not frustrated, are you?  I’m frustrated.  There’s no way you’re gonna report a lie.  It’s true, right?」</p>
<p>「Nn. But a Rank A adventurer is still early for me.」</p>
<p>『Fran...』</p>
<p>「Rank A adventurers are amazing.  I haven’t caught up with them yet.  So, they’re too early for me.」</p>
<p>  Fran shook her head in response to Gumdo’s words.  To Fran, a Rank A adventurer was like a longing.  Amanda, Forrund, and Hilt. They were not only strong, but Amanda had been running orphanages and saving many children.  With Forrund, she had been able to negotiate well with the royalty.  She had also traveled all over the country on various requests. Hilt has taken over the Dimitris school and has trained many disciples.  Although she does not want to make a social contribution, only the best adventurers with various abilities, strengths, and experience other than strength are allowed to become Rank A.  Rank S is already a long way off, and it is not something she would want to be. In that sense, Rank A, which is the best achievement of her efforts, may seem special to Fran.  </p>
<p>「... I see.  I know that’s what you’d think if you were to say that. But at that time, you’ll be promoted, okay?」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>  As Urushi’s huge body approached the harbor, I could see the faces of the adventurers stern down.  If Fran hadn’t told them that he was her servant, they must have escaped. Urushi, whose battle mode of watching over the ship to make sure it didn’t escape, was that powerful.  The only one who remained calm was probably Gumdo.  As one would expect from a man who was a member of a team that specialized in dragon hunting. Even in front of Urushi now, he was not afraid of him.  </p>
<p>「Fran, can you guide the ship this way?」</p>
<p>「Can we get into the harbor?」</p>
<p>「Yes. We’ll get in there directly to take over the crew members」</p>
<p>「Okay」</p>
<p> However, the current Barbra harbor and the surrounding area were not in a good condition to move, although the remains of the sinking battle ship were not very good.  So, we decided to clean it up from the remains of the ship first.  We only crushed it and stored it there. I thought they were in pain here, but the crew members of the Sea of Seedran were obedient.  Come to think of it, they were watching the fighting power of Fran and Urushi up close. They probably didn’t have the guts to voice their dissent.  Since they were still before they landed, they should have decent combat-specialized sailors, but no one against them. It took a while, but they succeeded in taking over 11 ships.  The ship itself was good and small. If things didn’t go smoothly, some of the ships would not be able to sail, and Fran and Urushi would have to force them to the harbor.  Well, we could use it if we fix it.  Some shipkeepers could even use repair for their ships.  </p>
<p>(I’m tired)</p>
<p>(Woof)</p>
<p>『We’re done with the harbor’s work, so let’s have some food before we go to the orphanage』</p>
<p>「Nn!  Curry!」</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>「F-Fran.  What’s wrong suddenly?」</p>
<p>  Oops, I was surprised by the sudden change.  I’ll make curry for you, so please forgive me.The ship itself was good and small.
