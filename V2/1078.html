</div><h1>Chapter 1078</h1><p>「......Fran-san. I’ll be leaving soon.」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>「Another time later.」</p>
<p> Satia waved her hand lightly at Fran and quietly disappeared into the shadows. We were supposed to meet up when we arrived in town. Satia’s demonkin took Fran and the demon knight’s bodies away. </p>
<p>「Frut, are you okay?」</p>
<p>『It seems that life magic has a healing ability, so don’t worry about it.』</p>
<p> Fran looked worried as she stared in the direction the demons were leaving. I guess her guilt from not being able to protect Fran had not disappeared yet. But talking to Satia seemed to have cleared her mind. But after talking to Satia, she seemed to feel much better.  </p>
<p>「...Raidos will never forgive you.」</p>
<p>  Because of this, she now had the luxury of turning her anger on the Raidos Kingdom. The anger that had been directed at the Southern and Eastern Dukes this time was directed at the whole thing.  </p>
<p>『Fran.  It’s good to be angry, but when we get back in that state, the people of the village will be scared.』</p>
<p>「Hmm.」</p>
<p>『Let’s calm down a little.  Okay?』</p>
<p>「Nn.  Thanks, Master.」</p>
<p>  Fran took a deep breath on the spot, quelling her own anger. When she calmed down and went back to the Metermam people, they were all worried.  They had been gone for almost an hour. And now a big wolf and a man was added in his mouth.  It would be stranger if they didn’t feel uneasy. When we asked the village chief about Dirk, he said that he didn’t know about him.  However, no one seemed strange as long as he was disguised and blended in with the villagers. After all, he was a specialist in in infiltrating, hiding, and construction. I was really lucky that we were able to capture him here.  </p>
<p>『Urushi, you can eat as much spicy food as you want later!』</p>
<p>「Hoh!」</p>
<p>(Master! Me too!)</p>
<p>『I know.  Fran has done her best, and you can eat as much curry as you want』</p>
<p>(Really?)</p>
<p>『Ou!』</p>
<p>(Iyaah!)</p>
<p>If you’re feeling a little better after a bad meal, you can eat as much as you want.  After that, we arrived at lockers without any problems. Everyone cheered when they saw the wall of lockers before the sun completely set.  This smoothness was also thanks to the almost no complaints from the villagers. Fran’s strength and the sense of urgency of the village’s destruction must have made them do so. We reunited with the Chief Soldier, whom we had talked with when we greeted the refugees from Dars, and entrusted the people of Metermam to him.  </p>
<p>「Adventurers-dono, thank you very much.  It is entirely thanks to you that there were no casualties in the village.」</p>
<p>「...... Nn.」</p>
<p>「But......」</p>
<p>  The old man’s face as he thanked us was apparently complicated.  Even if he was not familiar with Fran’s and Fran’s relationship, he knew that his friend had fallen into an unconscious weight. However, the old man seemed to have replied.  </p>
<p>「It’s unfortunate what happened to your friend. I wish you a quick recovery」</p>
<p>「... Thanks」</p>
<p>「Very well then」</p>
<p> Fran shook her hand with the Elder with a little smile and parted ways with them.  </p>
<p>(Metelmum is glad to have been saved.)</p>
<p>『Yeah, you’re right.』</p>
<p>  The sun has completely set in the middle of all these things.  We need to get to the guild as soon as possible.  </p>
<p>「Satia?」</p>
<p>「Fran-san, come this way!」</p>
<p>  Before we knew it, Satia had entered the lockers. She wore a hood to hide her face. </p>
<p>「Let’s go to the adventurer’s guild first.」</p>
<p>「Right.」</p>
<p>  The plan is to report to the guild first and ask the lord of this town to introduce her to us. We’ll have to discuss what to do with her.  Actually, the influence of Satia’s poison has already been lifted and she’s back to normal.  She has no arms or mouth, and no legs.  Besides, since Urushi still took her in, there was no need to worry about her running away. Right now, however, I’m still wondering how I can capture this guy without missing him. I couldn’t let Satia stay with me forever.  The easiest way would be to hurt him and force him to make a slave contract.  But even if it was an enemy, Fran would never accept or forgive him. If the guild master said that, they might get beaten up and start rampaging.  Without thinking about anything good, Fran and her group arrived at the Adventurer’s Guild.Without a good idea, Fran and Urushi arrived at the Adventurer’s Guild.  They almost made a noise many times when they saw the giant Urushi approaching, but the guards managed to keep him quiet.  Thanks to the larger number of guards than usual, they were able to arrive at the scene quickly.  A soldier led us in the middle.  Urushi went into Fran’s shadow, and Dirk carried Fran with her collar still in her grip.  This guy pretended to be powerless and didn’t move, but his eyes were clearly fixed on us for a moment. He was clearly waiting for an opening to escape. Fran didn’t notice him, but I guess he has seen it right now.  </p>
<p>「Fran-dono, have you brought back the people of Metermam?」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>「What about this man? Would you like to leave him with us?」</p>
<p>「Okay.  I’ll bring him with me too」</p>
<p>「I see.  Is that woman? She’s Fran-dono’s friend?」</p>
<p>「My friend.  Let’s go together」</p>
<p>「Okay」</p>
<p> The guildmaster readily agreed with Satia’s companion, probably thinking that she was some kind of adventurer.  We were led into the guildmaster’s office and told her everything there. And Princess?」</p>
<p>「I’m sorry for suddenly rushing over to you.」</p>
<p>「Kah!  One and only!  Nobles! You really are a princess, huh!?」</p>
<p>「That’s what she says」</p>
<p>「Haaah...  What do you think I should do?」</p>
<p>「Let me introduce you to the lord」</p>
<p> When Fran said that, the Guild Master, who was holding a sigh, shook his head with a wry smile. </p>
<p>「I’m the one!」</p>
<p>「??  Guild Master is the lord?」</p>
<p>「 Provisional.  Faber Magran, he’s the fourth son of Count Magran.  Immediately after his father died from an illness, this war broke out.  His brothers and sisters were training at the royal capital.  They won’t be able to return to their countries even if they return.  Until then, I will be their substitute for the lord! I’ve only taken half of the education for nobles, you know?  I’ll have to pay for it.」</p>
<p>  I didn’t know that.  I didn’t feel the aversion to him, but perhaps it was just a normal town. I’ve heard stories of nobles who didn’t succeed in becoming adventurers, and it would be impossible for them to be the masters of a local guild if they accomplished something.  </p>
<p>「Let’s send a messenger to the royal capital for now.  I heard that the Princess of the Kingdom of Philias has made a secret contact with her」</p>
<p>「I’m fine with that.  So, what should we do with him?」</p>
<p>「Hmmm.  Since he was an important person in Raydoss, I can’t kill him.  Anyways, we’ll just have to leave him at the guild. Let’s prepare some decent restraints and surveillance.」</p>
<p>「Please do.」</p>
<p>「But first, I’d like to interrogate him.</p>
<p>「Understood」</p>
