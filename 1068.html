</div><h1>Chapter 1068</h1><p>The demon knight lost his balance as his right arm and right blade were cut off, causing Fran to focus even further on the attack. </p>
<p>「Damn girl!」</p>
<p>「Haa!」</p>
<p>「Shit! Retreat!」</p>
<p>「Teyaaa!」</p>
<p> The wounds on the demon knight began to regenerate quickly. The same thing had happened since they were in their possession, but the regeneration inhibition of life magic was not working properly. Maybe it doesn’t work well against antidemons, demons, and other non-pure lifeforms. It may be hard for antidemons, demons, and other non-pure lifeforms to work.  But there was no problem. Before he could complete his regeneration and regain his balance, Fran sliced through his limbs and wings.  Because of the perfect timing, the demon knight was unable to regain his balance. In the end, he fell into the forest, looking like a cone.  Just as I thought I heard the sound of broken branches and leaves, a particularly loud sound of fracturing echoed through the air.  Apparently, he crashed into the tree trunk while retaining his momentum. The sound of the Devil Knight’s bones and the tree trunk cracking overlapped, creating an unpleasant sound.  As Fran headed for the falling point, a man was lying on the ground.  He had lost his right hand, left leg, and wings, and was vomiting a lot of blood from his mouth. The huge tree that seemed to have collided was crushed in the middle and collapsed.  It seemed that regeneration could not begin because almost no magic power had been lost. There was only a small amount of life force left, so he seemed to be just barely alive.  After lightly stopping his limbs, Fran began the interrogation.  </p>
<p>「Who are you?」</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p>「What is your name?  Are you from Philias?  Or are you from Raydoss?」</p>
<p>「...」</p>
<p> Besides, he looked like a knight, so his mouth was quite stern.  And he was not the type to spit out appropriate lies. That way, the Principle of Falsehood wouldn’t work.  They were just helping her. Moreover, the man made a quick decision.  </p>
<p>「Kill me」</p>
<p>「Understood」</p>
<p>「!」</p>
<p>  To my surprise, the man’s head exploded. At the same time, his left chest swelled from the inside for a moment.  </p>
<p>『He committed suicide』</p>
<p>「Nn...」</p>
<p>  It seemed that the demon had destroyed his head and heart from inside the man. I thought he had been able to neutralize it without killing it with a lot of effort... But when I appraised his body again, all I knew was that he had the name Rayus and a few skills related to the demon.  When I looked into his belongings, I didn’t find anything that showed his belongings. The demon seemed to have killed the man, but he couldn’t detect his presence.  I didn’t even know if he was still inside this corpse. I tried to store it away for now, and it turned out......  </p>
<p>「Let’s go to the village.」</p>
<p>『Yeah, I heard we can’t get any more information from him.  His existence was definitely exposed because of our fight with him. So, let’s be careful.』</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  We maxed out our presence as we headed for the village of Metermum.  Along the way, we didn’t sense any enemies. It was likely that the troops of Raydoss had taken over the village, but they didn’t set up any patrols. Was the demon knights really incapable of losing?  They easily led us to the village, but we noticed something was off.  There was no sign of anyone coming from the houses. Like Dards, I wondered if they had taken her somewhere else?  As I searched more extensively, I found that people were gathered at the end of the village.  They lied through the village and headed there.  </p>
<p>(... Are they Raydoss soldiers?)</p>
<p>『Yeah, how did they die......?』</p>
<p> A group of men who appeared to be Raydoss soldiers collapsed on the road.  I checked them and found they were already dead. However, I wondered how they died.  I found three dead.  But all of them were in a different state.  One of them had purple spots all over his body and an anguished expressions on his face. No matter how I look at him, he was probably killed by an instant poison.  The other two were injured, but their contents were much different. One of them was slain from the shoulder, and his internal organs had fallen off.  However, the other one had twists on the lower half of his torso like a korone. From his anguished expression, I could tell that he was in this state alive.  Poison, slash, and mysterious power.  Was there just three people in this village who could do this?  Well, I’m sure we could kill them the same way. Maybe that demon knight could have defeated the other two. But if the demon knight had defeated the Raidos soldiers, why didn’t they let Fran go into the village?  Did the Raidos Kingdom control the village and the Philias Kingdom, who was aiming for the catcher’s sake, took it back? However, I think Kranzel and Philias were friendly countries...  While I was thinking about it, Fran had reached her destination.  It seemed to be a place like a gathering place.  Well, it was a large flat with no roof. There, more than a hundred people were captured and lying on the ground.  Apparently, men and women and children were only bound with their limbs.  They also seemed to be quite weak. Are those who obviously invisible to the villagers adventurers?  No, not only that, but they also seemed to have captured the bandits in the area. They may be filthy for a villager, but their equipment was smaller and dirty than the other adventurers.  I couldn’t find anyone from the Kingdom of Raydoss in the square.  But I could tell that there were three people there.  One was a guard for the captives, and the other was standing there at the entrance of the convoy.  He looked like a human, but his armor was just like the demon knight we had fought earlier. Maybe he was similar too.  The problem was the two of them in the further back of the plaza.  A young man and woman with beautiful blond hair. We had seen each other before.  </p>
<p>(Frut and Satia?)</p>
<p>『Yeah, no doubt.』</p>
<p>  The two of them were discussing something with a difficult look on their faces.  They were the royalty of the Kingdom of Philias and Fran’s friends.One of them was probably a guard for the captives, standing in front of the entrance to the audience.
