</div><h1>Chapter 1063</h1><p>The swordsman opened his mouth as he held his sword. There was an unmistakable look of joy on his face.</p>
<p>「I’m Valusa. I’m now a member of the Western Knight Order of the Kingdom of Raidos」</p>
<p>「Fran, B-ranked adventurer」</p>
<p>「I see. So, the devastation in this port is yours?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>When Fran nodded her head, Valusa smiled even more happily.</p>
<p>「Fuahaha! I never thought that the adventurers I looked down on would destroy this proud fleet! I can’t wait to see what happens to the faces of all Raydoss’s adventurers!」</p>
<p>「...? You’re not from Raydoss?」</p>
<p>「I am not controlled by anyone, and I am the only king. I am a member of the Raidos Kingdom because I have more opportunities to kill stronger opponents.」</p>
<p>He was a true battle junkie! He seemed to be the type of person who didn’t care about anything else as long as he was willing to fight!</p>
<p>「Besides, if I cooperate with Raidos, I can become stronger. The alchemist said something about my life expectancy, but if I can be strong, I can give him about half of my life expectancy」</p>
<p>『This guy is a subdemon. I think he’s probably similar to Marl......』</p>
<p>I didn’t know what the difference was with the Demon Demons, but there was no doubt that they were willing to accept Raidos’ body modification.</p>

<p>「Did you get transformed into an alchemist from the Raidos Kingdom?」</p>
<p>「You used appraisal, right? That’s right, they said it was a combination of western and eastern alchemists, right? I heard they have implanted a small magic stone and a demonkin heart, right? Thanks to that, I have a stronger body」</p>
<p>「You’re just trying to keep my sanity.」</p>
<p>「What are you after?」</p>
<p>「If I beat you――I’d say, one of you’ll die. Well, I’ll tell you what you know. But let me kill you instead. Oh, I’ll tell you first. I don’t know if your goal is just that girl or not, but if you want to escape here, I’ll kill all the people in town, okay?」</p>
<p>「......I won’t run away.」</p>
<p>「Then it’s fine. After all, if you want to kill me here, it doesn’t matter what else. You can run as you please」</p>
<p>Did Fran come here to destroy the option of escape with only Charlotte? It seemed that their real purpose was to fight.</p>
<p>「The main purpose of dropping this town was to secure a supply route. Aah, there’s also going to be a diversion after that」</p>
<p>「Supplying and Diversion?」</p>
<p>「A small number of elite troops have already departed to secure a bridgehead to Philias.」</p>
<p>They were picking up some more inland villages that were firmly connected to Phyllius. They were planning to use those villages as a base for their operations.</p>
<p>Dards must be convenient for us to maintain a supply chain to the base location.</p>
<p>「However, we can’t supply inland locations as long as we have the control of the sea. It is more important to draw the attention of Kranzel than to supply them. Our goal was to draw in and divide the country’s forces into Dards」</p>
<p>「......You’re the only one strong for that」</p>
<p>「Just now that we destroyed the Kranzel fleet, we planned to not lose even without the water dragonkin. Well, with your appearance, I failed to do so though」</p>
<p>「......I’ve also defeated the fleet of Bulbola.」</p>
<p>「Fuahahaha! Well, that’s! For the Kingdom of Raidos, this is exactly what the Goddess of plague looks like!」</p>
<p>Maybe, they were expecting Rank B or lower. Since Rank A was supposed to be deployed on the borderline, they believed that only adventurers below that level would be deployed to recapture Dahz.</p>
<p>However, the Kingdom of Raidos, which was looking down on adventurers, may have underestimated Rank A as well.</p>
<p>They probably thought that if she had continued to bombard us from the sea, we would not lose.</p>
<p>「I was planning to join the brigade too, but I thought it would be more fun to deal with the adventurers who would come to recapture us. My intuition was right. After all, we’re too confused on the borderline to even stand there」</p>
<p>「The Raydoss forces are also attacking the border... Alessa?」</p>
<p>「That’s right. Well, I only know about the Western Duke’s circumstances. The ultimate goal of the Western Duke is to control Philias and obtain a Divine Sword」</p>
<p>After saying that much, Valusa readied her sword.</p>
<p>「It’s about time, isn’t it? Come on, let’s kill each other!」</p>
<p>「Last one.」</p>
<p>「What is it?」</p>
<p>「What were you trying to use Charlotte for?」</p>
<p>「 Charlotte, huh? Oh, that Dancer? It seems that any kind of job has the power to interfere with the dragon’s pulse. I heard that they can use it to strengthen the magic circle to attack Philias」</p>
<p>「I see」</p>
<p>「If you can live, then use the information now at best」</p>
<p>「I’ll do that then」</p>
<p>「Fuahaha! Let’s go!」</p>
<p>Valusa slowly slashed at her from above. Fran frowned at her seeing this――and then jumped to the side in a hurry.</p>
<p>「That’s fine! You dodged my attacks pretty well!」</p>
<p>(That’s...... now!)</p>
<p>『Probably, fictional slashing skill!』</p>
<p>By reproducing the killing intent and the sound of wind blasts, this skill makes it look as if he was really slashing at us. In fact, the real slash was a super-high-speed horizontal cleave that killed both killing intent and sound.</p>
<p>They were not of the highest quality, as Fran and I were blown away by an invisible blow.</p>
<p>Valusa was smiling, even though she didn’t even snatch her. Rather, the impression was that it was fun and inevitable.</p>
<p>「Damn! Even after you got stronger, you’ve never been able to meet swordsmen of the same level or higher, and you’ve been through a lot, huh!?」</p>
<p>She’s not just a battle junkie, she’s particularly insistent on fighting with swords.</p>
<p>「Teyaaaaah!」</p>
<p>「Fuhahaha! That was amazing! Okay!」</p>
<p>Valusa laughed loudly as Fran landed a blow.</p>
<p>「No hits!」</p>
<p>「Shah!」</p>
<p>Valusa’s Holy Sword Mastery was level 4, and she was inferior to Fran in terms of stats. However, she was still able to engage in a fierce exchange with Fran. She was really on par with her.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s because Fran didn’t dare to use any strengthening skills. Perhaps it’s Fran’s pride, but she doesn’t seem to want to win by pushing herself too hard with her stats.</p>
<p>Still, it was unusual for him to dare to go with Fran, someone who had Sword King Skill. She must have lived for the sword because of her insistence.</p>
<p>He has a huge amount of experience and has countless draws in battle. He made full use of his False Slash and Brilliant Slash skills, which are difficult to use and are very fast in attack. There was no single attack that was the same pattern as the other attack, but Fran dealt with them as if she had experienced it.</p>
<p>And Fran, who was more than evenly matched head-on with such an opponent, was also amazing. She was able to use her skills well.</p>
<p>They continued the sword clash for five or ten minutes, but still, they did not lose their breath. Aside from their physical strength, they must also be exhausted from their magic power. They were both using multiple skills at the same time to keep their magic power transferred to the sword.</p>
<p>In fact, the Valusa’s magic sword had the ability to suck out our magic power. It was carried away every time it struck us. Moreover, it seemed to be sucking power from the Evil God and Fenrir. If it had been an unstable situation in the past, there might have been a negative effect.</p>
<p>Anyway, it would still be a while before we ran out of Valusa’s magic power.</p>
<p>「That’s good to hear! I think it’s moving better」</p>
<p>「Fufun!」</p>
<p>Apparently, Fran’s Swordking Mastery had been further refined through her experience with Valuza.</p>
<p>Fran slashed back with a smug look on her face. Fran also seemed to enjoy the slashing match with this man. But it was time for such a fun death match to end.</p>
<p>I saw a black magic bullet launched from a sky high above us.</p>
<p>『I got a signal from Urushi!』</p>
<p>However, nothing he said was a lie.</p>
<p>Fran nodded lightly and readied me. Valusa also stopped to regain her composure, perhaps sensing something in her movements.</p>
<p>「...Is it the end?」</p>
<p>「I’ll end it.」</p>
<p>「It’s a pity. But I don’t think it’ll be easy to defeat!」</p>
<p>「...I’m going seriously」</p>
