</div><h1>Chapter 1018</h1><p>The giant antidemons were unable to get up, and began to move in some strange way. Their limbs were relaxed, and their whole body was beginning to twitch. However, what was shaking was a super-sized body on par with the high-rise buildings. Just because its body trembled, it was trembling. Even the dwarves, who should have had strong legs, were trembling to the point that their movements were blocked. Wouldn’t it be bad if they attacked us in this state? Orfalve and Jayne seemed to know all this and immediately evacuated their men. Even though they fell down many times, they slowly leave the giant antidemons. Despite falling down many times, they slowly retreated from the giant antidemons. As people disappeared from their surroundings, Addle attacked them, but they still could not stop the spasms.  The spasms gradually increased in intensity, and a change suddenly occurred to the giant antidemons.  Their bodies began to transform, making a muffled sound.  There was a high-pitched, heavy noise, as if a huge reinforcement had been twisted. Something seemed to be happening deep inside their body that could create such a sound.  A few minutes later, the giant antidemons had undergone a significant transformation. It was the same in color and size.  However, it was not in the human form as it had been in the past, but in the shape of multiple legs, just like an insect. There were seven arms and legs.  In addition to the previous arms and legs, one from both sides and one from the butt.  There was not much change from the neck up, but the neck was slightly deformed and extended from the occipher to the torso. It was probably a weirdo that looked like a weirdo, but that made sense.There was not much change from the neck up, but the head was slightly deformed and stretched from the occipital to the torso.  It seemed that his current body was making it easier for him to turn his head inward.  It was a weirdo, but that made sense.  With this, there was little danger of him being attacked intensively and falling.  He also seemed to have the ability to change the shape of his body according to his circumstances.  </p>
<p>「Grooooooooh!」</p>
<p>「Shield!」</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Yeah!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>  The dwarven shield activated its shield art at the same time.  At about the same time, a mass of evil energy was released from the mouth of the giant antidemon.  The evil energy, which radiated like a dragon’s radiating breath, was held back by the pale blue magic shield. Not only did it transform into less likely to collapse, but it also seemed to have changed the way they attacked.  They must have been attacking large armies more easily. Immediately after the shield arts disappeared, one of their legs was wiped out this time. The dwarves reacted quickly and readied their shields again, but they were unable to block a heavy blow.  Nearly a hundred dwarves were blown away and lying on the ground.  Their legs, albeit a little thin, were more than ten meters in diameter.  If such heavy objects had been enough to wipe them out, the damage would have been minimal. However, this was the most damage we’ve dealt so far.  </p>
<p>「I’ll keep my distance for now! This position is too dangerous!」</p>
<p>「We’ll lure you!  In the meantime, you need to meet up with the others!」</p>
<p>  The transformation of the giant antidemons made them lose their advantage in close range. The queen must have immediately decided to do so.  The dwarves bravely moved forward.  They probably intended to buy time for everyone else to evacuate.  Though poor, the dwarves didn’t make any noises or complain at all. They continued their march, chasing after Orfalve, the leader of the group.  There was no time to hesitate here.  The dwarves only suffered more damage while they were flustered. </p>
<p>「Wrrrooof!」</p>
<p>「It soared!」</p>
<p> The giant antidemons, who had folded the seven legs in a big motion, jumped like a flying locust.  They landed with surprisingly little impact and braced themselves to block our exit. Judging by the distance we were currently flying, it seems he won’t be able to escape by just running.  He was finally getting pushed backwards.  Should we already aim for victory with a all-out attack?  After all, we were out of the castle barrier, so we could use the Dimension Gate. However, if we used Space-Time Magic to keep our distance from the rest of the army, we would be caught up with her in no time at all.  Over time, the giant antidemons became stronger and more powerful with the supply of magic power.  Anyone who gained time in vain would only be at a disadvantage. Everyone knows this and has a stern expression on their faces.  Everyone wonders what to do and stops for a moment.  But there was a man who never stopped moving.  </p>
<p>「I guess I have no choice but to defeat him.  You should look there.」</p>
<p>  It’s Adoru, the Divine Sword Knight of the Holy Nation of Silard.  He walked forward toward the giant antidemons, with his entire body emanating Divine Power. It seemed that he had been building up his power for a long time, and that Divine Power was spreading all over his body.  </p>
<p>「Wait.  If you’re going to attack us, all of you should get together. We’ll cover for you.」</p>
<p>「It’s not necessary.」</p>
<p>「Ah, wait!」</p>
<p> Orfalve and Jayne tried to hold him back, but Ader did not stop.  Soon after, Ader’s figure disappeared. She had jumped at a speed we couldn’t even track, and in the next moment, she was right in front of the giant antidemons.  Even he couldn’t seem to catch Addle’s super godly speed.  He looked somewhat surprised. However, he showed tremendous reaction time and immediately extended his legs.  Four of his legs had been slammed into the air from all sides―― to pieces, trying to crush Addle. Addle had apparently slashed at him.  However, his slashes were not visible to us.  No matter how many times I saw him moving, Addle’s movements were extraordinary in an open Alpha state. I don’t want to fight him.  I wonder what kind of technique he was willing to use to unleash his full power...  As long as he didn’t have any more techniques to stop him, all I could do was just watch. Of course, she was building up her power to attack us.  </p>
<p>「Divine Sword Art, Evil God Slayer」</p>
<p>  That’s a straight name!  But its attack was as powerful as its name. It really would cut even the Evil Gods. The divine energy cloaking her blade swung down the Alpha, which looked to be more than twice as long, from above.  What she was doing may be similar to Fran’s Heaven Judgement. It was a slash with divine speed, but the power contained in it was so immense that we couldn’t twist it no matter how we looked at it.  A white flash of light dyed the surroundings, and everyone’s eyes were closed. Then, a moment later, a terrifying impact shook the earth.  More than half of the troops had collapsed in just one earth tremor.  A wave of storm-like magic power that came right after it shook the other half. But there were still warriors standing, even though all of them were elites.  They couldn’t stand.  It was caused by only one slash from Adoll. But the real impact came after that. What Fran and the others saw when their blindness subsided was a terrible sight.  </p>
<p>「... Amazing」</p>
<p>「W-woof」</p>
<p>「I knew it, the Divine Sword is tremendous」</p>
<p>「Even a Divine Sword must be specialized in direct combat to do that」</p>
<p> All of them voiced in disbelief.  To their surprise, they were too distracted to even care. A deep, long, deep, straight valley stretched out behind them. A deep valley had been drilled into it as if it had existed before.  It was so long that I couldn’t see ahead. Maybe it was the work of one person?  A similar scene had been created with the Black Tiger Lightning Rush, the trump card that Fran had used as a Divine Beast. However, this one was even wider, deeper, and longer.  While I was so surprised that I had stopped thinking, Fran and Urushi ran out of the spot. They found Addle lying on the ground.  And there was no smile on everyone’s face, including Fran. </p>
<p>『Even though it looks like that, can you defeat it!?』</p>
<p>  The giant antidemons had just begun to regenerate.  The warriors returning to me attacked each leg. But it would be difficult to block their regeneration with a normal attack.  </p>
<p>『Damn!</p>
<p>『Shit!</p>
<p>『Shit! I hope Jayne and Jayne can get their ritual magic ready!』</p>
