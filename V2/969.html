</div><h1>Chapter 969</h1><p>『I see it! It’s a giant!』</p>
<p>「The town is......」</p>
<p>「Woof......」</p>
<p> The target finally appeared in front of the second unit, which continued to move while taking a break. The huge antidemons that had stood up rose and rampaged through the walls of the illegal city of Satte. They were almost as tall as huge high-rise buildings and even climbed over the walls of the town. I don’t think they were 200 meters tall... But they were too huge to accurately estimate their size. Compared to the town, they were probably about the size of a child standing in a vinyl pool. It was about the size of a child standing in a vinyl pool compared to the town.Compared to the size of a town, it was probably about the size of a child standing in a vinyl pool.  Of course, it was not an opponent that could be defeated by any soldier or adventurer.  The sight of its huge body, which was far more powerful than I had imagined, was even more impressive than I had imagined.  The knights and adventurers, who were supposed to be the elites I had chosen, gasped and stopped.  However, Isario and Fran were not frightened at all. Isario sighed in the same carefree manner as before. </p>
<p>「Aah, he’s gonna break that guy’s bones」</p>
<p>  I was worried that the adventurers would sink into the timid words of the S-ranked adventurer, but it seemed to be the opposite. Seeing Isario’s change in appearance, I could see that the adventurers were calm.  </p>
<p>「This time, I’ll take him down」</p>
<p>「Grrrr!」</p>
<p>  Fran and Urushi looked motivated.  They were fighting with a fighting spirit that was so strong that even those around them could understand. This Fran’s attitude also helped to calm the adventurers down.  Isario and Fran.  Seeing how reliable the two of their top brass were, they had completely regained their will to fight.  Their expressions have changed drastically. They may be underestimating each other, but they were still able to regain their motivation.  And the Militant Nation of Hagane was just like usual too.  The old soldiers were calm with astonishment, and there was no hint of fear in the face of the giant-type.  The same went for the hydrangeas who had come out of the carriage. A little kid?」</p>
<p>「We will need to work with the adventurers next time. Whether or not you’ll be able to move will depend on the evacuation situation for the people in the town」</p>
<p>  The woman escorting her seemed to be a little angry.  Not only did her face, but her voice was very similar to that of a commander. Maybe these two are sisters.  I mean, this situation is quite bad, isn’t it?  Neither Isario’s Ignis nor Hagane’s Berserk are stupid for the damage to the surrounding area. It would be difficult for them to use them against the giant-types in the town.  So, Fran would have to do her best. I wonder how well the adventurers and knights could fight against that huge antidemon...  The old hagane soldiers were also raring for a fight, but it would be difficult to defeat that giant-type. Basically, the soldiers would lead them out of the city with long-range attacks and throw Fran’s party’s moves at them.  </p>
<p>「What do we do?」</p>
<p>「They would check with those jumpers like Miss Hilt, and then guide them with long-range attacks from the outside of the wall. We’ll drag them out of the wall and drive them all out together, I guess?」</p>
<p>「Isario-dono’s strategy is fine. Let’s join in the long-range attack.」</p>
<p>  The nodder explained the equipment and skills of the old soldiers.  He said that some of them could use magic, and even if they couldn’t do it, they were still training their bows. Indeed, they all possessed archery and archery.  Therefore, it was possible to apply it even at a considerable distance.  It was not that they were not confident in it, but that it was natural for them to do it. </p>
<p>「Are you sure that’s okay with that?」</p>
<p>「Nn」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「I’d like you to take care of the keeping force. Are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Okay」</p>
<p>「The lead time is long, so it’s best if you don’t get tired as much as possible」</p>
<p>  Isario was right.  If it was over here, we could attack with all our might. But the battle won’t end there. Since we still had a fight with the other giant-types after this, we couldn’t exhaust all of our power here. </p>
<p>「For now, I’d like to move from the wall to the closest giant-type」</p>
<p>「Yeah」</p>
<p> Even though we were confident in our range, we couldn’t target them from a distance of more than a kilometer.  The limit was about 500 meters.  That’s why we decided to start by looking for the closest between the giant-type and the wall. We went along the wall around the illegal city.  There were no signs of anyone in the wall. I hope they managed to escape, but if that wasn’t the case, there would have been a lot of damage.  </p>
<p>「Hmm.  The giants came this way」</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>『You noticed them?』</p>
<p>  The giant-type gazes turned to us. They had clearly sensed the presence of the second unit. </p>
<p>「The atmosphere has changed drastically」</p>
<p>「You’re coming here?」</p>
<p>  If we chased after this unit, we would save the trouble of provoking them, but... </p>
<p>「Rooooooooourgh!」</p>
<p>「The giants are moving!  Be careful!」</p>
<p>  It was just right after our warning.  We saw something with a huge mass flying from the direction where the giants were.  It was the roof of a house. We also pulled it out of the house under our feet and threw it away. Isario was about to unleash his magic, but before that, we had made our move.  </p>
<p>『Fran!』</p>
<p>「Nn!  I’ll do it!」</p>
<p> Fran jumped up and stored the rubble. </p>
<p>「Miss Hilt, that’s great!」</p>
<p>「Nn.  I’ll be the one to come flying! Please attack him!」</p>
<p>「Understood!」</p>
<p>  Fran was in charge of defense, and you were in charge of the command.  It was quite different from the original plan, but the battle of the second group had just begun.  </p>
<p>「Miss Hilt!</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
