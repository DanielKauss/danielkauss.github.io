</div><h1>Chapter 970</h1><p>Fran, riding on Urushi, stowed away the rubble thrown by the giant-types one after another to nullify it. </p>
<p>「I’ll go all around while Black Lightning Princess-dono is luring us! Everyone, hurry up!」</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Hah!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「</p>
<p>「Yeah!」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p>」</p>
<p> At the commander of the Hagane Kingdom, your voice was obeyed not only by the old soldiers under his command, but also by the soldiers and adventurers of other countries. They were probably the commanders of a major country. But not only that, but they also had a presence that made them unavoidable. Maybe it was the effect of their command skills. Anyway, it seemed that there would be no problem if we left the commander of the troops to her. </p>
<p>『Urushi.  They keep up the position so that the giant-types get annoyed and start moving to react directly to them』</p>
<p>「W-woof?」</p>
<p>『Don’t get too close』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>『Fran, we’ll use magic to randomly provoke them』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  flashes of light and explosions, focusing on the face.  There was almost no damage.  It originally had a high defense power, and the magic power was greatly weakened by the magic absorption effect. It’s good to do that because it’s a provoking purpose, but you’ll have to be careful when you attack it properly. </p>
<p>「Roooooooooo!」</p>
<p>「Muh!」</p>
<p>『Tsk!  So, you’re just a wooden doll!?』</p>
<p> The giant-type, which had been watching us as we stowed away the rubble, suddenly changed the way he attacked us.  Instead of using large rubble, he held in a number of small rocks and threw them down as if they were scattered bullets. The giant-type was throwing rocks at that angle.  It was quite intelligent and had high defense and regeneration power.  It was a type of power that could not be controlled by any special abilities.  It might be similar to a Midgardsorm among the enemies in the past. Well, that was pretty ridiculous.  But I don’t even know what kind of hidden ball they still have.  </p>
<p>『I’ll knock down the rock with telekinesis and wind magic.  Fran, you put the debris in storage!』</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  Maybe they repeated that process about five times, when the giant-types threw rubble at us to block it. The barrage of magic and arrows from the soldiers also got rather violent.  They didn’t want their faces to be targeted even if they didn’t have any damage. The number of moves to shake off long-range attacks was increasing. And finally, the giant-type seemed to have made a commotion.  </p>
<p>「Ruuurgh!」</p>
<p>『Yosh!  The big ones in front of us have made their move!  Lead them straight to the outside of the wall! Urushi, can you keep this distance?』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>  His huge body was moving step by step toward us and the soldiers behind us. He approached us, step by step, destroying the rubble and houses. It looked slow, but with a size of 200 meters, every step of his body would be over 50 meters.  With a dull thud, his huge body collided with the wall. Its legs didn’t seem to rise high, and it seemed to have been caught by the wall.  </p>
<p>「Ruaaoooh!」</p>
<p>「Norr, come here!」</p>
<p>「Ruaaa!」</p>
<p>「Woof―」</p>
<p>  Fran and Urushi flew around in front of the giant-type’s face in a relaxed manner. The giant-type roared in anger and rushed forward at an even faster pace than before, destroying the wall.  He tried to reach for us and grab us, but Urushi was skillfully maintaining a distance that we just barely could reach. The annoying giant-type then stepped forward. Not only was it smacking, but it was desperate to capture Fran somehow with the tremendous sound of its footsteps.  Its consciousness was completely focused on Fran, who clearly emitted powerful magic power, and the second group, which was not so strong as each person. The antidemons seemed to want to devour Fran first.  They chased us as far as they could.  I thought she was intelligent, but that might not be as intelligent as I thought.  They didn’t even notice that she was being held so high. Or were they just going to get rather high if they were not going to be defeated by a small opponent like us?  Anyway, their behavior was the reason for your defeat.  </p>
<p>『Great Wall!』</p>
<p>  A giant-type that pulled its legs on a wall created by land magic and lost its stance. He fell to the ground without a care in his hands, gripping the air with his hands.  Crack!  For a moment, the impact of his actions shook the earth as if the soldiers’ bodies were floating.  It was just a normal bump, but it seemed that the weight of the wall had caused a lot of damage to itself.  However, I was not the only one who created the wall. It was also your commander who unleashed the land magic.  She seemed to be a wielder of land magic.  The width of the wall was carefully adjusted to create an exquisite size to make the giant-type lose its shape. The control over it was quite impressive.  As long as she was the boss of a divine sword user, these girls were also tremendous wielders of the earth.  </p>
<p>『Yosh!  Let’s attack them right now!』</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
