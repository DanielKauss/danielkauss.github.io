</div><h1>Chapter 1023</h1><p>As the hydrangea pulled out Berserk, a moan leaked out from the Militant Nation soldiers. I thought they were afraid of getting caught up in it, but that was not the case. Their faces were clearly filled with sorrow and regret. </p>
<p>「It’s not worth it for us to do something like that...」</p>
<p>「Even the Hydrangea Princess is...」</p>
<p> I guess they were saddened to see the Hydrangea use Berserk for such a sacrifice. It seemed that the soldiers of the Militant Nation of Hagane cherished the wielder of the Berserk. It seems that the soldiers of the Militant Nation of Hagane valued the wielder of the Berserk.  They seemed to have more respect and affection than just superior beings.  Fran seemed to have stopped the hydrangea, but she didn’t say that out loud. At the moment, it would be difficult to end the huge antidemons without her help.  Besides, the wielder of the divine sword had made up his mind.  Fran would not be able to do anything to erase that feeling. She clenched her fists so tightly that they gave way, but she was still standing.  </p>
<p>「Fran」</p>
<p>  and </p>
<p>「Hydrangea」</p>
<p>  The girls’ gazes intertwined.  They stared at each other for a few seconds. But in a few seconds, the situation changed drastically.  </p>
<p>「Wait.  Berserk girl, there’s no longer need for you to sacrifice.」</p>
<p> The voice of the voice was Jayne, the Demon Lord.  </p>
<p>「?  What do you mean?」</p>
<p>「It’s an adult’s job to risk your life at a time like this.」</p>
<p>  Jayne quickly stood in front of the girl and stopped the hydrangea with a serious look on her face. However, the hydrangea shook her head and tried to step forward.  </p>
<p>「That antidemon is beginning to regenerate.  I don’t have much time.」</p>
<p>  Like she said, the body of the giant antidemon was visibly healing. We couldn’t let it continue for a long time to come. But Jayne did not retreat.  </p>
<p>「So wait. You don’t have to attack――」</p>
<p>  Kyudooom!  As if in sync with Jayne’s words, a huge explosion occurred on the surface of the antidemon’s body. The flames burned its body and turned the regenerating part into ashes.  It was clearly not normal magic. It was probably the work of a figure in the sky.  </p>
<p>「Us demonkin and an adult.  And he’ll do his best―」</p>
<p>「That’s... Isario!」</p>
<p>  As Fran shouted, the identity of the person who had unleashed the explosion was Isario, who should have been missing. His body was supported by a translucent, ghost-like object.  </p>
<p>「Did Jayne find Isario?」</p>
<p>「That’s right――!」</p>
<p>  Jayne, who had responded to Fran’s words, shook her hand lightly. A dagger appeared as if it was a magician.  It flew at high speed and seemed to have returned to Jayne’s hand. It was a dagger designated as a national treasure and said to be one of the proofs of the Demon Lord’s identity.  </p>
<p>「This dagger is one of the best catalysts for necromancy. I used it to create a ghost that maximized my detection and leadership abilities to help me search through the rubble.」</p>
<p>  I summoned an enhanced ghost with the dagger at its center, letting him command a large number of ghosts. That’s probably why she had created an Isario search party that could work without any problems even under the rubble. Jayne was probably not very active in the battle because she focused on that.  </p>
<p>「But are you okay with Isario?」</p>
<p>「Well, he won’t be able to fight for a long time, you know?  But he’ll be fine! After all, I’ll be joining in too!」</p>
<p>  Jayne held up the dagger high.  From there, the mana overflowed from the divine attribute.  </p>
<p>「You shall atone for your death, and bless your death with your death.  Know your death, mark your death, and make the most of your death! Necronomicon!」</p>
<p>  The door opens in front of our astonished eyes. </p>
<p>「Divine Sword Release!」</p>
<p>  A blueish-black light emitted from the dagger, a national treasure, taking away everyone’s vision. When the light subsided and everyone’s vision was restored, it was not even a weapon.  </p>
<p>「A book?」</p>
<p>『Is that, a Divine Sword? Well, it’s a general term for super weapons and I knew that there are times when it doesn’t have the shape of a weapon...』</p>
<p>  Sophie’s oratorio was also in the form of an instrument. I never thought a Divine Sword was still hiding in such a close distance!?  What was floating on it was a huge book with a metal cover.  It was about the size of a 22-inch TV, huh? The silver cover had been engraved in the same way as the dagger before it was released, showing some things in common.  The overflowing intimidation and divine energy made it easy for anyone to believe that it was a divine sword.  The divine sword floating in mid-air―― the magic guide sword, Necronomicon, slipped smoothly on Jayne’s hand. It was completely untouched, floating a few centimeters above her palm.  </p>
<p>「The heroic spirit’s chapter, section 7 of the adventurer’s play.  Replare seven battlefields with unbreakable defeats, the Seventh Demon Lord.  Once she pulled out the sword, she fell seven heads and crashed seven castles. After seven days and seven nights of fighting, she defeated the Seven Kingdoms, and became the greatest warrior king――」</p>
<p>  In sync with Jayne’s words, the page was flipped around on its own.  Then, small letters-like things jumped out of the opened page into the void. The magic circle formed a circle and drew something like a magic circle.  As the magic circle shone a light, something even larger came up from it.  It was a coffin.  It was a very sumptuous and intimidating coffin made of stone, with engravings on the entire surface. No doubt that those who were buried inside were of a noble status.  As everyone watched in bated breath, the door to the coffin opened on its own.  In this narrow coffin, a mummy was placed.  </p>
<p>「Awaken, heroic spirit! We, my forerunners!」</p>
<p>『...... It’s been a long time since I’ve been on a battlefield.』</p>
<p> A face peeking out from between the bandages smirked.  </p>
<p>「Exactly. Take this big monster down with us!」</p>
<p>『Oh?  Got it, great!  How fearsome he is!  I can sense a power draining from his body!  Morten Dovey, the former Demon Lord! Let’s go on a rampage!』</p>
<p>  From the name, he seems to be Jayne’s ancestor.  It’s probably the same as the Tort on his necklace, but his power is on a different level. However, the power is on a different level.  Considering Morten as a magical beast, wouldn’t he be able to reach Threat Level A?  The bandages that had been wrapping around her mummy’s body turned into a grains of light and unblurred, turning into an armored heap, adorning Morten again. The magical power cloaking her was so nasty that the enemy would never want to unleash it. I saw Tort fighting in his body, but it was much stronger than that.  </p>
<p>「Don’t worry.  Now then, heroic spirit chapter, Part――」</p>
<p>  Moreover, Jayne summoned two more necromancy magic beasts with Dovey’s last name and sent them off to the battlefield. All of them were strong.  Morten was a swordsman, and the newly invoked Diez and Maut seemed to be of many different types. There seemed to be many different types of swords.  Could it be that they were divine swords that allowed the use of powerful undead? Jayne briefly told us about Fran’s doubts.  </p>
<p>「These are the successive generations of Necronomicon’s wielders. And it all came down to it.  Those who make a contract with the necronomicon, the sword that guides the demonkin, will become heroic spirits and will continue to protect the demonkin even after their death.」</p>
<p>  So the price of using it meant that the necronomicon would continue to be used by the user even after their death. Both Fran and I were shocked, but Jayne was not sad.  </p>
<p>「Ahahaha!  That was great power, right?」</p>
<p>  She was really trying to say it. Maybe it was not to be repelled by her, since she was a powerful necromancer.  </p>
<p>「Now then!  Ignis, oratorio, and necronomicon!  Three divine swords in competition!So, the price of using it must be higher than what would come with a necronomicon after their death? Both Fran and I were shocked, but Jayne was not sad. </p>
<p>「Ahahaha! That was an amazing power, right?」</p>
<p> She seemed to really mean it. Maybe it was not to be repelled by her, since she was a powerful necromancer. </p>
<p>「Now then! Ignis, oratorio, and necronomicon! Three divine swords in competition! Burn it on your eyes!」</p>
