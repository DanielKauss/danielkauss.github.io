</div><h1>Chapter 1041</h1><p>「Fran, it looks like you’re worried, huh?」</p>
<p>「Auntie!」</p>
<p> Fran was greeted by Nadia, who was waking up on the bed. </p>
<p>「Oi oi, you’re getting sick. Don’t shake me too much, okay?」</p>
<p>「I’m sorry」</p>
<p>「Ahahaha! I’m joking! Come on, come on!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p> Fran smiled, even when she hugged her a little harder. It seemed that she was physically recovered. It seems that she was physically recovered. Her face was still tired and in tatters. </p>
<p>「It must have been hard, huh?」</p>
<p>「Nn.」</p>
<p>  Nadia stroked Fran’s hair with gentle hands. Fran looked relieved and submitted herself to them.  After a few moments of confirming each other’s safety, Nadia asked me about a lot of things. She had heard that there was a big antidemon, but she didn’t know the details of the incident.  </p>
<p>「...... Auntie. I have something you want me to ask you.」</p>
<p>「What is it?」</p>
<p>「About the Silver Lady.」</p>
<p>「......Let’s ask her.」</p>
<p> I don’t know how Nadia felt about the Silver Lady. It was definitely not something that could be easily expressed.  That was why Fran thought she needed to tell Nadia about her last words. She wanted to get her to sort out her feelings.  </p>
<p>「The Silver Lady is now combined with Master.」</p>
<p>「Hmm?」</p>
<p>  But she was still the same Fran.  </p>
<p>『Fran, you don’t understand that, I’ll explain it to you. I’ll explain it to you.  I know better.』</p>
<p>「I beg of you, Master.」</p>
<p>「Nn.  Please, Master.」</p>
<p>  I explained that the Silver Lady had appeared on the battlefield and was assimilated and absorbed by me. She explained that her true name was the carrier of hope and that she had entrusted her power to me on her own volition.  When she heard the name of the bearer of hope, Nadia’s expression was indescribable.  It was not that she was angry or sad. But she had a sad expression on her face.  </p>
<p>「...... I see.  Did you sleep? If that’s the case, it must have been a good ending.」</p>
<p>『I’m so sorry.』</p>
<p>「Why would Master apologize?  I owe her a debt of gratitude. It’s a pity to think that she’ll always carry Overgrowth like that and hurt her wherever she goes.」</p>
<p>  The bearer of hope had a slight feeling.  There was no way she wouldn’t do anything in return for continuing to carry the failed divine sword that would surely kill its wielder one day. I could understand why, since I had become one with her bearer of hope. Nadia seemed to have sensed this and was worried about the fate of the bearer of hope.  The bearer of hope had doubts about her mission.  Is what she was doing really carrying hope? Did she only cause many people misfortune?  Either way, that was not the case. The Silver Lady was indeed the bearer of hope for the successive generations of Overgrowth’s wielders.  The bearer of hope vanished with complete confidence, leaving everything to me. The result was probably a somewhat better ending than Nadia had imagined.  She smiled in relief and Nadia’s hand reached me.  As Fran and I watched in silence, she gently touched my guard and lightly patted me. Her hand was kind and compassionate.  </p>
<p>「... Good job, thank you.」</p>
<p> Even though she was pointed at me, her words were not directed at me.  Nadia had been petting me for a bit, but she soon got back into a good shape. Her face was a little red, perhaps embarrassed to feel a chilled mood.  </p>
<p>「Now that we’ve got that out of the way, can you tell me what kind of adventure Fran has been on since then?」</p>
<p>「Nn!  Got it!」</p>
<p> At Nadia’s urging, Fran uses a lot of gestures to talk about the period since then.  The antidemons, dragonkin, and divine swords.  In Sendia, Georg, Meritte, and many other plots and schemes intertwined to save her with her divine sword and song. In the middle of the continent, she fought a series of huge antidemons, defeated huge antidemons with the help of her divine swords, and finally, she was punished by the gods. It was a dark time somehow.  Nadia ate the divine sword the most. Since she had used a failed divine sword, she seemed to be interested in the divine sword.  They asked her a lot of questions.  </p>
<p>「Which sword do you want to know about?」</p>
<p>「True. </p>
<p>「?  You’ve never seen Isario’s sword before?」</p>
<p>「I’ve only seen it in the form of a normal sword, but I’ve only seen it several times from a distance. I’m sure I’ve seen it up close in a long time ago, but there were so many of it at that time, that I only remember how I turned my enemy into ashes」</p>
<p>  Even though Isario was on this continent, he didn’t use his Divine Sword often.  Besides, he often used it by himself so as not to get people involved. This time was special.  </p>
<p>「Ignis is super amazing!  Super amazing!」</p>
<p>「I know you’re dealing with flames, you know?」</p>
<p>「Nn!  But its sword and its flames!  When you hold it, all of it will be flames!  So, it looks super heated!」</p>
<p>「Aah, does that mean the sword itself will become flames?」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>  Fran’s words were bad because she was more excited than usual. Fran felt a little younger than her age because of her lack of connection to people, but now she felt much younger than her. Even so, Nadia continued to listen to Fran with determination, and sometimes asked questions to try to understand her.  She didn’t do anything rash here, like I giving her a short summary of everything.  I could see that she was also enjoying her conversation with Fran.</p>
<p>「A big antidemon is Dianne!」</p>
