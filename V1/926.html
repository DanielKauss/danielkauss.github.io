</div><h1>Chapter 926</h1><p>Almost at the same time as Urushi’s victory, the battle between their friends ended.</p>
<p>A pillar of white flame that Mea unleashed that made me think she was going to plunge into the sky. It burned up the four-armed knight-type. The reason why we were nearby was completely unaffected by any heat was probably that it was under perfect control.</p>
<p>Velmeria was fighting a huge knight-type about five meters long. However, she lost a head-on fight with Velmeria and was smashed with a fist covering her head.</p>
<p>Zefmate, who had been struggling the most, managed to cut down the knight-type, which had about twice as many limbs, with a series of attacks and disappeared.</p>
<p>Compared to Fran and Urushi, they were considerably more damaged. It was not so much a difference between the Holy Beast Form and the Divine Beast Form, but more a difference in their original abilities.</p>
<p>If Royce and Goddarfa, who were our companions to the Beast King, had become a holy beast, it wouldn’t be surprising if they could fight on par with Fran now.</p>
<p>「Zefmate, nice one!」</p>
<p>「Thank you very much, Your Majesty.」</p>
<p>Zefmate smiled at Mea’s praise. It seems that his master and servant here were doing just fine too.</p>
<p>All of them defeated their commanders, fulfilling their roles well. As a result, there seemed to be a change in the antidemon horde.</p>
<p>It was the same as when we met at Castel. They had lost their leader and had begun to move separately. It seemed like there were several commanders in this flock. Several of the swarm had joined up and must have been on this large scale.</p>
<p>「It’s coming!」</p>
<p>The surrounding antidemons rushed toward us at once. If things continued like this, the antidemons might strike an avalanche and rush toward Sendia.</p>
<p>But Fran and Urushi were not worried about her.</p>
<p>In front of Sendia, the transformed giant dragon Lindwurm was sitting.</p>
<p>「Ghrooowl!」</p>
<p>The shockwave created by his roar knocked down the antidemons, and the flames spitting out from his mouth turned the antidemons into charcoal with a single blow. He blasted them with his tail, a large number of antidemons disappeared, and the wind caused by his wings held back the antidemons.</p>
<p>It truly looked like an impenetrable fortification. No one could possibly break through its defenses.</p>
<p>That said, I don’t know how long the strengthening from the Oracle will last.</p>
<p>「We will destroy the remaining antidemons as soon as possible!」</p>
<p>「Nn!」</p>
<p>Fran and her party scattered in all directions, destroying the antidemons as much as they could.</p>
<p>Well, in Fran’s case, the main focus would be on me and Urushi’s magic. I would scatter thunder magic and flame magic while manipulating steel wolves to defeat antidemons.</p>
<p>Urushi’s enhanced dark magic also had a much longer range, probably far beyond that of a human magician.</p>
<p>In the distance, the white flames were raging silently, and I could see that water magic was swallowing the antidemons like a creature.</p>
<p>Is that Zefmate? Be careful with the friendly fire.</p>
<p>Even though she knew that Mea’s flame control was perfect now, I still had the impression that she was a former outburst girl. Mea would be able to do something against Zefmate if she made a slight mistake.</p>
<p>I was a little nervous watching over Zefmate, and he was also moving much faster and more tricky.</p>
<p>Thanks to the fact that I activated my entire body with my leopard skill, I was able to pat her in the air with my hands, elbows, and sometimes tail, and then turn or jump at unexpected times.</p>
<p>In the end, nothing happened until the very end. Well, there was a suspicious scene, but Zefmate had avoided it.</p>
<p>Maybe Mea really was the one who buried the enemy the most? Velmeria would surely be the next candidate.</p>
<p>「I’ve almost defeated them!」</p>
<p>「I’ve defeated all the antidemons in the vicinity. No problem anymore.」</p>
<p>Mea and Velmeria gave us a light high five. Before we knew it, these two seemed to get along.</p>
<p>「Woof!」</p>
<p>「Urushi, so cool」</p>
<p>『I’ll give you a reward later!』</p>
<p>「Woof woof!」</p>
<p>For now, the crisis was over.</p>
<p>「We, win.」</p>
<p>「Indeed! That’s right!」</p>
<p>While everyone was happy in this way, the song of the adventurer that had echoed on the battlefield suddenly stopped. At the same time, the golden magic that had enveloped Fran and Katley also lost its shine.</p>
<p>「Hmm? My power is...」</p>
<p>『Oi, this is not a good place to go! Let’s get back to town before we leave!』</p>
<p>「Nn. Let’s go to the town」</p>
<p>「Indeed! That’s right! Let’s run!」</p>
<p>I don’t know how many side effects or backlash we would see, but they were all surprisingly strong. The backlash from that backlash would definitely be heavy.</p>
<p>We hurried down to Sophie and the others, using all the strength we had left. Well, it would have been only a few seconds in our current state though.</p>
<p>I realized why the song stopped as we got closer to town. Sophie and the others were sitting on end.</p>
<p>I’m sure they had put all their might into this fight too.</p>
<p>But when they spotted Fran and the others, they all stood up and waved their hands. Then, they were greeted with applause and cheers.</p>
<p>「Thank you―!」</p>
<p>「Thanks!」</p>
<p>「That was amazing!」</p>
<p>Everyone was smiling. I could feel the joy from the bottom of their hearts and gratitude towards Fran and Urushi. Fran must have understood that too.</p>
<p>Seeing these citizens, Fran muttered to them.</p>
<p>「Good」</p>
<p>『Yeah』</p>
<p>I understood what Fran was saying, no matter what she didn’t say. I felt the same way too.</p>
