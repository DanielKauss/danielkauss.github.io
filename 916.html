</div><h1>Chapter 916</h1><p>I was wounded to the bone, full of wounds.</p>
<p>That was exactly what happened to Fran and Urushi.</p>
<p>「Urraaaaaah!」</p>
<p>Twisted pain and fatigue with impatience, Fran shook me.</p>
<p>「Gishaaa!」</p>
<p>「Aw yeah...... Teyaa!」</p>
<p>The antidemons attacked without having time to rest up. They were so violent that I wondered if there was anything wrong with their throats or lungs, or if they were breathing from the cold.</p>
<p>I’d love to make a suggestion to run away, but there was no way Fran could run away from here.</p>
<p>「Daryaaaaah! Burn!」</p>
<p>「Water Dragon Impact!」</p>
<p>That’s because close to Fran, my friends Mea and Velmeria were fighting alongside her, struggling in the same way as Fran.</p>
<p>Her white hair and skin were reddish, dirty, and very painful. Velmeria’s scales and nails were peeling off, and her blood splattered every time she wielded her arms.</p>
<p>Zefmate’s entire body was covered with wounds, and Rhynd and the others had lost one of their wings.</p>
<p>There was no way Fran could leave such friends behind and run away alone.</p>
<p>(Master! Together!)</p>
<p>『Yeah!』</p>
<p>Fran slashed away at the antidemons that moved quickly, and I used my magic to defeat the antidemons that came to chase us.</p>
<p>Still, that would not be enough to prevent the swift attacks of antidemons. The area around the antidemons was already enveloped in a jet-black type, making them difficult to defend against.</p>
<p>「Grrr!」</p>
<p>「Ugh!」</p>
<p>The wolf-type grazed Fran’s right arm. It managed to hold on without letting go of me, but the antidemons didn’t miss this chance.</p>
<p>He jumped from all directions.</p>
<p>Fran clutched the antidemon’s throat with her left hand and released her right arm, but she couldn’t intercept it in time. Sensing this, I activated my magic on the spur of the moment.</p>
<p>『Blow them up!』</p>
<p>Simultaneously activated, Gale Hazard created a wall of wind around us. However, there was an antidemon that had protected itself with magic armor and withstood strong winds.</p>
<p>I caught three red wolf-types with big mouths on Fran’s shoulders and legs, but Fran didn’t let out a single grunt.</p>
<p>On the contrary, they immediately attacked the wolf-type. The crimson-type was an advanced version of the jet-black type.</p>
<p>If we could defeat three of them here, the antidemons would surely suffer a lot.</p>
<p>Fran thought so, and instead of evading it, she was prepared to withstand it with her own strengthening by magic power and bit it into herself. So, she was going to limit the opponent’s evasive ability and counter them.</p>
<p>She must have made that decision in front of the three approaching her, then instantly made the decision. Her movements were almost at the same time she was bitten.</p>
<p>「Raaaaah!」</p>
<p>『Let Fran go!』</p>
<p>Fran manipulated the black lightning all over her body and concentrated on one body biting into her right leg. The wolf-type, which was burned by the black lightning from inside, fell to the ground with black smoke billowing from its entire body.</p>
<p>My steel threaded decorative strings assaulted one of them on her left leg and entangled them all over her body. Then she pulled them off and passed magic power through the threads wrapped around her neck. After she lowered her head, she could defeat them even with the crimson-type.</p>
<p>She thrust me into the last one of his shoulders, and then put an end to it. The wolf-type tried to evade, but Fran’s attack was only a moment faster.</p>
<p>Even these beast-type antidemons specialized in speed couldn’t evade in time if they were targeted at the moment they attacked.</p>
<p>Thanks to Fran’s abandonment strategy, she managed to get rid of three of the most troublesome red wolves in the enemy. It was the end of the war, but Fran didn’t have a smile on her face.</p>
<p>「Ghuh...」</p>
<p>『Is it poison!?』</p>
<p>I’ve used poison on a wolf’s habit! I instantly healed him with Antidote, but I could see. Fran was already at his limit. It was originally at its limit, but the magic poison for a moment had stopped working.</p>
<p>The antidemons mercilessly rushed at Fran, who was still standing on the defensive.</p>
<p>『Fran! It’s already too late!』</p>
<p>(......Don’t run away!)</p>
<p>『Aah! Jeez!』</p>
<p>I’ll use magic to intercept the antidemons, but when I run out of magic power, it really will be over. At this point, I have no choice but to use teleport to force them to escape.</p>
<p>Mea and Zelos Reed then retreated into the city together and managed to regroup their forces. I don’t know if they really could recover, but it would be better than them dying here.</p>
<p>It was just when I was starting to wonder where to activate my Dimension Gate.</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>Fran looked at her feet with a strange look on her face.</p>
<p>At that moment, the earth shone a golden glow.</p>
<p>A huge amount of magic power blew around us, stopping the antidemons in their tracks. This was probably the same principle that Sophie’s applied magic attracted the antidemons’ attention.</p>
<p>Suddenly, they stopped moving because they didn’t know how to react to the magic that had enveloped them.</p>
<p>I wondered if Ashwrath had come to us for a moment, but I was wrong.</p>
<p>The magic power that filled the battlefield was so gentle that it couldn’t be found in that demonkin’s magic power. Both Fran and I recognized this magic power.</p>
<p>(Sophie, we’re back......)</p>
<p>It was the return of the saintess that we had been waiting for.</p>
<p>There was definitely a hint of Sophie on the other side of the collapsed wall, and not just her. Thousands of people followed behind her.</p>
<p>But isn’t that weird? There were way too many people here. It felt like――</p>
<p>Before my doubts took shape, Fran muttered a powerful word. I couldn’t sense any signs of weakness in her voice.</p>
<p>「I’m overflowing with power」</p>
<p>『Me too!』</p>
<p>Fran’s wounds were starting to heal, but the strength and magic power I had lost was slowly returning.</p>
<p>The music reverberating through the battlefield gave us some energy. It was a kind of orchestra, a combination of multiple sounds, so unlike an orchestra, I couldn’t believe you were playing alone. Did the orchestra find Sophie like that?</p>
<p>Still, this song...... Followed by Sophie’s music, I could hear a song. It wasn’t Sophie’s song. Hundreds or thousands of people were singing it all at once.</p>
<p>「I know this song.」</p>
<p>『That was the song that the adventurers were singing back in the bar.』</p>
<p>What reverberated through the air was a cheerful and cheerful song.</p>
<p>「We are adventurers~...♪ The golden adventurers~...♪」</p>
<p>「No foe shall make us falter!」</p>
<p>「Dragons, demons, bring anything on!」</p>
<p>「The horde of antidemons is a piece of cake!」</p>
<p>They were not as refined and beautiful as I imagined when I heard they were singing in unison. They were all singing in unison and in a daze. I couldn’t call them as good or beautiful as they sounds. But that was why I had enough time to think about them.</p>
<p>Thousands of voices echoed through the air.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, I felt a power rising from hearing them.</p>
<p>「You really are rooting for me.」</p>
<p>『Yeah, you’re right』</p>
<p>It wasn’t just any music. This was a cheering song for Fran and the others.</p>
<p>「Go for it, lose. We’ll fight together.」</p>
<p>My wounds were healed, my strength returned, and my mana was starting to recover. But more importantly, the fact that we were not the only ones seemed to have given Fran and Urushi more strength.</p>
<p>「Fran! I’ve brought in more reinforcements!」</p>
<p>「Sophie!」</p>
